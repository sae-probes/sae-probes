"Evaluation of in vitro bromodeoxyuridine labeling of breast carcinomas with the use of a commercial kit. The prognostic significance of S-phase fraction analyses of breast carcinomas has been reported by several investigators. The Cell Proliferation Kit (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL), which uses in vitro bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) labeling to evaluate cell cycle kinetics without a flow cytometer or radioisotopes, simplifies this assay for the clinical-based laboratory by providing standardized reagents and recommended methods. This study was performed to determine whether data derived from its use were comparable to published S-phase data from the use of thymidine labeling, BRDU, or other methods on breast carcinomas. Primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas (n = 142) and primary lobular carcinomas (n = 6) showed mean and median BRDU labeling of 4.63% and 3%, 1.3% and 1%, respectively, with a range of 0-28%. Benign lesions always had less than 3% BRDU uptake (n = 21). Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status correlated with BRDU labeling (P less than 0.05), with the highest S-phase fractions in ER- and PR-negative tumors. Correlations between BRDU uptake and histologic tumor type or size were observed. Significant correlations between BRDU uptake and lymph node status, patient age, or histologic tumor grade were not observed. S-phase studies of breast carcinomas using other techniques have shown similar data, therefore, the Cell Proliferation Kit appears to be a practical and useful method for in vitro S-phase analysis that allows concomitant histologic examination of the same tumor tissue sample.",360,1
"Inhibition of cell mediated cytotoxicity by sulphasalazine: effect of in vivo treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on in vitro natural killer cell activity. Decreased cell mediated cytotoxicity occurs frequently in inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in patients with active disease. It is not clear, however, whether this decrease is caused by the disease or is a consequence of the medical treatment. In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on the in vitro natural killer cell activity in five patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission and in four healthy control subjects in a double blind randomised crossover trial preceded and separated by four weeks of treatment with placebo. The natural killer cell activity was significantly impaired in 67% (six of nine subjects) after four weeks' sulphasalazine treatment and tended to be related to subjects with a slow acetylator phenotype. In contrast, 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment caused only a marginal reaction in the natural killer cell activity in 22% (two of nine subjects). The inhibitory effects were found to be reversible since the decreased natural killer cell activity was completely restored after placebo treatment in all subjects. In conclusion, in vivo treatment with sulphasalazine inhibits the in vitro natural killer cell activity and this seems to be mediated by the sulphapyridine moiety. This phenomenon may contribute to the low natural killer cell activity found in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease.",297,0
"Dietary fat and risk of breast cancer. The relationship between dietary fat and subsequent risk of breast cancer was studied in 3988 initially cancer-free Finnish women aged 20-69 y. During a follow-up period of 20 y, 54 breast-cancer cases were diagnosed. Risk of breast cancer was significantly inversely related to energy intake and nonsignificantly inversely related to absolute fat intake. A positive association between energy-adjusted total fat intake and occurrence of breast cancer was also observed. The relative risk in the highest tertile as compared with the lowest tertile was 1.7 (95% confidence limits 0.6-4.8). The corresponding relative risks were 1.4 (0.5-3.7) for saturated fatty acids, 2.7 (1.0-7.4) for monounsaturated fatty acids, 1.2 (0.6-2.8) for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 2.2 (1.0-5.0) for cholesterol intake. Adjustment for different potential confounding factors did not alter the results. The present data suggest that breast cancer is associated inversely with energy intake and weakly positively with energy-adjusted fat intake.",255,1
"Natural death as viewed by the medical examiner: a review of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease. A study of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease was conducted. Cardiovascular disease was responsible for 60.9% of all deaths with coronary artery disease--not only the main cause of cardiovascular death but also the main cause of all natural deaths--accounting for 45.1% of such cases. Diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6%, respectively, of the natural deaths. Seizure disorders and pneumonia were the main causes of death in these organ systems. There were 124 deaths of children less than one year in age, 91 of which were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). All of the SIDS deaths were in children less than 10 months old.",189,0
"Unilateral hydrocephalus in adults. The authors report 14 cases of unilateral hydrocephalus in adults. Headache was the most common presenting symptom. Unilateral hydrocephalus was documented in each patient with computed tomography scans; magnetic resonance imaging was also used in seven patients in the latter part of the series. Unilateral hydrocephalus was caused by tumor (seven patients), venous angioma (one patient), ependymal cyst (one patient), postinflammatory gliosis (one patient), and was idiopathic in four patients. The primary surgical treatment was craniotomy with fenestration of the septum pellucidum, which relieved symptoms in eight of nine patients for whom long-term follow-up data were available.",143,1
"P-31 spectroscopy study of response of superficial human tumors to therapy. Studies were performed to characterize phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectra obtained from 10 superficial human tumors outside the brain and to determine whether P-31 MR spectroscopy could allow detection of a response to therapy before a change in tumor size was measured. The ratio of phosphomonoester to adenosine triphosphate peak intensities (PME/ATP) was unusually large in all tumors studied. The average PME/ATP in lymphomas (1.8 +/- 0.5) was greater than in nonlymphoma cancers (1.1 +/- 0.15). The average PME/ATP for all tumors studied (1.4 +/- 0.5) was much greater than that of underlying skeletal muscle (0.23 +/- .09). Eight of the tumors were studied before and after therapy. Responders were distinguished from nonresponders on the basis of changes in tumor size. PME/ATP decreased during therapy in three lymphomas that responded to therapy. In an adenocarcinoma and Ewing sarcoma that did not respond to therapy, PME/ATP increased. PME/ATP remained constant in two squamous cell carcinomas that responded to therapy and decreased in one squamous cell carcinoma that decreased in size by 40% but was classified as a nonresponder. Changes in PME/ATP did not always parallel changes in tumor size during therapy. In two patients, a decrease in PME/ATP preceded a decrease in tumor size. In four patients, PME/ATP increased transiently during periods when tumor size remained constant.",330,1
"Appendiceal carcinoma masquerading as primary bladder carcinoma. We report 2 cases of appendiceal adenocarcinoma invading the bladder. Both tumors masqueraded as primary bladder carcinomas. Cystoscopic biopsies obtained adenocarcinomatous tissue and the secondary nature of the bladder lesion became apparent at laparotomy in both cases. One patient was treated with surgical resection of the appendix, the adjacent cecal wall and the bladder wall, and postoperative irradiation. She was well 10 years later. The other patient was treated with right colectomy and segmental bladder resection. She died of diffuse peritoneal recurrence 6 years later.",124,0
"Trends in basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma of the skin from 1973 through 1987. Major increases have occurred in the incidence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, as well as in cutaneous malignant melanoma during the period 1973 through 1987 in British Columbia. The greatest increases in basal and squamous cell carcinomas are on the head and neck. This indicates that exposure to sunlight is the major causative factor. The greatest increase in melanoma is on the trunk in men and on the lower limbs in women. The dramatic increases in nonmelanoma skin cancers in British Columbia, a relatively low sunlight area, suggest that major prevention programs are needed in areas that are not considered ""sunspots."".",157,1
"Malignant mixed tumor (malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma) of the maxilla. We present a rare case of carcinosarcoma (malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma) of the left maxilla that developed in a 63-year-old Japanese man. The tumor recurred repeatedly despite multiple surgical removals, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy and led to progressive cachexia; the patient died after 3.8 years of hospitalization. Histopathologic examination revealed that the recurrent tumor was carcinosarcoma, which had progressed from malignant ameloblastoma with fibroma. An autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of malignant mixed tumor with lung metastasis of malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma.",146,1
"Chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms in Holocaust survivors. In Nazi-occupied Europe (1939-1945), Jews were submitted to extreme mental and physical hardships (the Holocaust). This study was designed to investigate the impact of the severe protracted suffering on the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, we studied 623 consecutive patients of Eastern European origin who had been admitted for nongastrointestinal complaints. They filled out detailed questionnaires, and were divided into the following two groups: A) Holocaust survivors [237 subjects who had been for at least 6 months in either German concentration/extermination camps (95 subjects), ghetto and/or underground movements (65 subjects), labor camps not directly supervised by Germans (79 subjects)], and B) a control group (384 subjects from the same demographic background, who had not been exposed to Nazi persecutions). The symptoms investigated were the following: abdominal pain, irregular bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal distension, heartburn, flatulence, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mucus in stool, tenesmus, and aerophagia. Patients were defined as having functional symptoms after these had been present for at least 5 yr and relevant organic disease had been excluded. The prevalence, duration of suffering, and frequency of appearance of most symptoms were significantly higher in the group of Holocaust survivors. This study supports the clinical observations that severe and protracted suffering contributes to the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptomatology.",302,0
"Methodological problems in evaluation of cardiovascular effects of stress in humans. Cardiovascular effects of stress in humans are often assessed by application of physical or emotional stimuli in a laboratory environment. Although this method provides important information, these procedures have several limitations. First, blood pressure and heart rate responses to laboratory stressors are characterized by a limited within-subject reproducibility. Second, there is poor correlation between blood pressure and heart rate responses to different stressors, which implies that individual reaction to stress may be estimated differently according to the test used. Finally, these responses bear only a limited relation to 24-hour or daytime blood pressure variability, that is, they reflect to only a limited extent the tendency of blood pressure to vary during daily activities. If assessed by techniques that allow blood pressure to be continuously recorded for 24 hours in ambulatory subjects, blood pressure variability represents a possible approach to observation of cardiovascular reactivity away from an artificial laboratory environment. However, whether blood pressure variability should be expressed as a percentage or in absolute values is controversial. Furthermore, although naturally occurring stress may markedly increase blood pressure, 24-hour blood pressure variations also depend on factors that are not related to emotional stimuli. Thus, the study of cardiovascular responses to stress in humans encounters several problems, regardless of the method used.",257,0
"Colonic motor activity in acute colitis in conscious dogs. The changes in motor activity of the colon during acute colitis were investigated in six conscious dogs. The motor activity was recorded with seven strain-gauge transducers. Colitis was induced in the entire colon by luminal perfusion of acetic acid. The dogs exhibited urgency and diarrhea with mucus and blood during colitis. The mucosa was diffusely erythematous and friable and there were scattered ulcerations over the mucosal surface. The motor activity of the colon changed in several ways during colitis: (a) the total duration per hour and the mean duration of contractile states decreased significantly; (b) the cycle length of colonic migrating motor complexes was significantly prolonged, and the nonmigrating motor complexes were almost completely absent; and (d) the incidence of giant migrating contractions increased significantly. About half of the giant migrating contractions were followed by defecation. The remaining expelled mucus or gas. Sometimes, a migrating motor complex in the colon was also followed by defecation; this was never observed in the normal state. The motor activity of the colon was still decreased and the cycle length prolonged 21 days after induction of colitis. However, the dogs were asymptomatic at this time and the mucosa looked normal at colonoscopy. The incidence of giant migrating contractions was also normal at this time. It was concluded that the dog is a good model for the study of colitis because of the similarity of symptoms with human ulcerative colitis. The phasic contractions of the colon decreases during colitis but the incidence of giant migrating contractions is increased. The diarrhea in colitis may primarily be due to the large number of giant migrating contractions in the middle and the distal colon.",335,0

At surgery, the tumor was completely removed, and no neurological deficit was observed after the operation. ",92,1
"The IVH complex of lesions: cerebrovascular injury in the preterm infant. The term intraventricular hemorrhage has become associated with a variety of cerebrovascular insults in preterm infants. Because of a shared pathophysiology and timing, these are the neurologic lesions to search for when evaluating sick preterm infants. This complex of lesions is common and, when parenchymal injury occurs, likely to result in neurologic sequelae. A review of the variety of injuries, their pathophysiology, their diagnosis by cranial ultrasonography, and their prognosis is offered. Emphasis is placed on the need for assessment over time when evaluating parenchymal lesions in preterm infants. ",128,0
"Results of intracoronary stents for management of coronary dissection after balloon angioplasty. Dissections after coronary balloon angioplasty are risk factors for acute or subacute vessel closures. Intracoronary stenting was developed to avoid these complications by pressing the intimal and medial flaps against the vessel wall, thus reducing the risk of acute thrombosis. A total of 22 stents were implanted into the coronary arteries of 15 patients with dissections after balloon angioplasty causing angina pectoris or ischemic electrocardiographic changes. Stent delivery was successful in all cases. In 1 patient acute stent thrombosis was documented and treated successfully by thrombolytic therapy. Another patient underwent coronary artery bypass surgery 24 hours later because of persisting angina. Angiograms after 24 hours documented vessel patency in the remaining 14 patients. Late control angiograms after 4 to 6 months were obtained in 12 of 14 patients. Vessel patency without significant restenosis was observed in 8 patients, restenosis in 3 and reocclusion in 1 patient. All 3 patients with multiple stent implantation had restenosis (n = 2) or reocclusion (n = 1), compared with 1 patient with single stent implantation. Thus, intracoronary stenting appears to be a secure and effective method of handling bailout situations caused by dissection after balloon angioplasty, with good long-term results when only a single stent is implanted.",300,0
"A surgical approach to the cervicothoracic spine. We describe a method for approaching the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, the brachial plexus and related vessels. The method involves the elevation of the medial corner of the manubrium, the sternoclavicular joint, and the medial half of the clavicle on a pedicle of the sternomastoid muscle. We have used this exposure in 17 cases with few complications and good results. Its successful performance requires high standards of anaesthesia, surgical technique and postoperative care.",108,0
"Cerebrovascular complications of inflammatory bowel disease. There is an increased incidence of central nervous system thromboembolic events in young patients with inflammatory bowel disease. A 33-yr-old woman previously diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri suffered superior sagittal and transverse sinus thromboses during a severe flare of ulcerative colitis. These were documented on contrast computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Stroke may be more common in patients with ulcerative colitis than in patients with Crohn's disease; arterial disease is more prevalent than venous and dural sinus disease, and is correlated with an active phase of inflammatory bowel disease. It is difficult to assess whether there is a relationship to concurrent steroid use, and a consistent relationship to duration of inflammatory bowel disease or to other extraintestinal manifestations is not apparent.",167,0
"Markers of chronic alcohol ingestion in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: an aid to diagnosis. We report here the use of the biochemical marker desialylated transferrin to aid in the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Conventional biochemical tests used for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption fail to differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients from alcoholic subjects. In addition, even in those alcoholic subjects with alcoholic liver disease in whom biopsy has been performed, it is impossible to differentiate these two disease states on the basis of morphological examination alone. In this study we have examined two new markers of excessive alcohol intake, desialylated transferrin and mitochondrial AST in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. All nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients consumed minimal or no alcohol and were diagnosed by morphological criteria based on liver biopsy specimens. Alcoholic subjects were consuming in excess of 80 gm/day ethanol, often with clinical evidence of overt alcoholism. Control subjects included both healthy controls and patient controls with liver diseases unrelated to alcohol. The ratio of desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was elevated only in patients who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, whereas the ratio of mitochondrial AST to total AST (mitochondrial AST/total AST) was not significantly different between alcoholic subjects and patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was 81% and 98%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity for the mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio was 92%; the specificity was only 50%, indicating that there were a large number of false-positives. All the conventional markers were less sensitive and less specific than the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin.",360,0
"The Merkel cell and associated neoplasms in the eyelids and periocular region. Merkel cells are clear oval cells in the epidermis and outer root sheaths of hair follicles, which are probably of epithelial origin, share ultrastructural features with neuroendocrine cells, and are found in association with touch receptors. In the eyelid, they occur singly in the epidermis and external root sheaths of hairs and eyelashes, and in specialized touch spots alternating with eyelashes. Their typical electron microscopical and antigenic features include dense-core granules, intranuclear rodlets, spinous processes, and a positive reaction for specific cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and synaptophysin. Merkel cell carcinoma probably develops from precursor cells which give rise to keratinocytes and Merkel cells, and nearly one out of ten Merkel cell carcinomas occur in the eyelid and periocular region. They tend to be bulging lesions near the lid margin of elderly patients, reddish in color, and erythematous with telangiectatic vessels. The diagnosis is based on the frequent presence of neurofilaments and paranuclear aggregates of intermediate filaments in addition to features typical of normal Merkel cells. The tumor often mimics lymphoma or undifferentiated carcinoma and frequently invades lymphatic vessels. One third of Merkel cell carcinomas recur, almost two thirds give rise to regional node metastases, and up to one half metastasize widely and result in death. Initial treatment should be prompt and aggressive, with wide resection and routine postoperative irradiation. Although metastatic lesions often respond to radiation therapy and cytostatic drugs, these treatments are mainly of palliative value. ",329,1

"Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome. A multisystem mitochondrial disorder in infancy. Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome (McKusick No. 26056) is a fatal disorder of hitherto unknown etiology involving the hematopoietic system, exocrine pancreas, liver, and kidneys. The observation of high lactate/pyruvate molar ratios in plasma and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation in lymphocytes led us to postulate that Pearson's syndrome belongs to the group of mitochondrial cytopathies. Since rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome between direct DNA repeats were consistently found in all tissues tested, our results show that this disease is in fact a multisystem mitochondrial disorder, as suggested by the clinical course of the patients. Based on these observations, we would suggest giving consideration to the hypothesis of a defect of oxidative phosphorylation in elucidating the origin of other syndromes, especially those associated with an abnormal oxidoreduction status in plasma.",184,0
"Serum enzyme alterations in chronic muscle disease. A biopsy-based diagnostic assessment. The results of interpretation of muscle biopsies were compared retrospectively to activities of serum enzymes and isoenzymes. A total of 137 patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in 1986 and 1987 were included in this study. Serum enzymes evaluated were CK, AST, LD, and aldolase (ALS), as well as the percentage CK-MB isoenzyme. The units of CK-MB and the ratios of CK to AST, LD, and ALS were calculated. Descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, and stepwise logistic regression were performed. A diagnostic algorithm was constructed using a computer-assisted rule generation program. Myopathic diseases yielded a greater mean increase in serum enzyme activity than atrophic diseases. By multivariate stepwise logistic regression, increases in serum AST and CK activity were independently associated with the presence of inflammation in a muscle biopsy specimen. The diagnostic algorithm allowed for the separation of myopathies from atrophies and could identify cases of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and polymyositis.",230,0
"Fine-needle aspiration evaluation of lymphoproliferative lesions in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. A multiparameter approach. Forty-six fine-needle aspirates of lymphoproliferative lesions from 31 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients were reviewed using cytomorphologic, immunocytochemical, flow cytometric (FCM), cytogenetic, and molecular studies. There were 29 lymphomas (15 small non-cleaved cell [SNCL], 11 large cell [LCL], one small lymphocytic, and two Hodgkin's), 14 reactive hyperplasias, and three ""atypical lymphoid proliferations."" The reactive hyperplasias were characteristically polymorphic and polyclonal lymphoid populations; six of seven were diploid on FCM, the seventh was hypodiploid. Higher proliferative indices (mean, 11.6%) and higher RNA indices (mean, 1.2) characterized this subgroup compared with published reactive lymphoid hyperplasias from patients without HIV positivity. Aspirates of SNCL showed monotonous populations of intermediate-sized cells except in one patient where a giant cell syncytial variant occurred. Nine of 13 SNCL aspirates showed light chain restriction. JH rearrangement revealed B-cell lineage in one aspirate in which immunocytochemical study was negative for Kappa, lambda, B1, and Leu-4. Nine of 12 SNCL were diploid; the mean proliferative index was 25.6% and the mean RNA index 2.3. Chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc locus were demonstrated in five of seven SNCL aspirates karyotyped. Five of eight LCL showed light chain restriction the remaining three showed null cell phenotype. Large cell lymphomas were diploid on tetraploid with the mean proliferative index of 22.0% and mean RNA index of 2.2. One of two LCL aspirates karyotyped demonstrated c-myc translocation. Despite the multiparameter approach, a definitive diagnosis could not be reached in three aspirates.",426,1
"Application of the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 on prostate biopsies to assess the fraction of human prostatic carcinoma. The feasibility of using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 as a proliferation marker in human prostatic carcinoma was studied on aspiration and core biopsy specimens obtained from 50 patients suspected of having prostate cancer. In 32 prostatic adenocarcinomas the Ki-67 index varied from 0.3 to 13.3% (mean 4.3) in cytological smears and from 0.8 to 17.8% (mean 5.1) in frozen sections from histological core biopsies. No significant correlation between the percentage of cells positive for Ki-67 and the histological tumor differentiation could be established. In 18 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia the Ki-67 index varied from 0 to 3.0% (mean 1.2) and from 0 to 3.8% (mean 1.4) in cytological and histological material, respectively. The differences in the observed Ki-67 index between benign and malignant prostatic tissues are of statistical (p less than 0.001) and of clinical significance. Nine patients who underwent endocrine treatment or radiotherapy entered a followup protocol in which the Ki-67 staining procedure was applied to periodically obtained cytological aspiration biopsies. During month 1 after the start of therapy a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in the Ki-67 index to 58% of the initial values was found, while at 2 and 3 months the proliferative fraction showed a further decrease to 27 and 7%, respectively. As a marker, the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 was shown to provide a reliable method to estimate the proliferative cell fraction of human prostate cancer.",378,1
"Diagnostic value of DNA analysis in effusions by flow cytometry and image analysis. A prospective study on 102 patients as compared with cytologic examination One hundred twenty-six effusion samples from 102 patients were examined by cytology and flow cytometry (FCM). Overall, there was an 84% correlation between cytologic and FCM results. Of the 36 malignant cases determined by cytologic examination, FCM revealed an aneuploid peak in 20 (56%). Image analysis (IA) performed on the malignant cytologic cases with a diploid flow pattern detected two additional aneuploid peaks. In addition, FCM indicated three aneuploid cases in which cytologic characteristics were initially interpreted as benign (false negative). Aneuploidy was therefore detected in 64% of the malignant effusion specimens by FCM and IA. Twenty-three of the total of 24 aneuploid cases detected by FCM were associated with malignancy (predictive value = 96%). The one nonmalignant case was that of hemorrhagic pancreatitis with infected pseudocyst. FCM is an excellent tool when moderate to large numbers of tumor cells are present, whereas use of IA is advantageous for specimens containing smaller numbers of malignant cells because these can be directly analyzed. When an aneuploid peak is present, a diagnosis of malignancy must be suspected, and, if the initial cytologic screen is negative, a critical review of the cytology slides is justified. In those cases with an equivocal atypical cytology report and an abnormal cytometric histogram, additional investigation is warranted. In some malignancies the tumor cells will be diploid (in this study 36%) and neither FCM nor IA will add to tumor detection, leaving cytologic examination as the definitive technique.",362,0
Direct monitoring of capillary perfusion following normovolemic hemodilution in an experimental skin-flap model. The effects of normovolemic hemodilution on skin flap survival are studied in a recently developed skin-flap model (homozygous hairless mouse ear) in which nutritional capillary flow is monitored directly by means of intravital microscopy from the time of flap creation throughout the establishment of necrosis. Two diluting agents (dextran 60 and hydroxyethyl starch 200) are utilized. Our quantitative findings demonstrate that the amount of nonperfused tissue following flap creation in both the dextran (n = 23) and starch (n = 13) groups was significantly decreased as compared with controls (n = 19). Our qualitative observations suggest that improved hemorrheologic properties at the microcirculatory level are responsible for the observed decreased necrosis. Various mechanisms by which hemodilution may act to prevent necrosis are discussed.,197,0
"Intraperitoneal lymphokine-activated killer-cell and interleukin-2 therapy for malignancies limited to the peritoneal cavity. Autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were administered intraperitoneally (IP) to 24 patients with malignancies limited to the peritoneal space. Ten patients had ovarian cancer, 12 had colorectal cancer, and one patient each had endometrial carcinoma and primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma. All ovarian cancer patients, three of twelve colorectal cancer patients, and one patient with endometrial carcinoma had received prior therapy. Patients received IL-2 100,000 U/kg every 8 hours intravenously (IV) for 3 days, and 2 days later underwent daily leukapheresis for 5 days. LAK cells were generated in vitro by incubating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IL-2 for 7 days and were then administered IP daily for 5 days through a Tenckhoff catheter (Davol, Inc, Cranston, RI) together with IL-2 25,000 U/kg IP every 8 hours. All but one patient completed at least one cycle of therapy. Toxic side effects included minor to moderate hypotension, fever, chills, rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, oliguria, fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and minor elevations of liver function tests; all of these rapidly improved after discontinuation of IL-2. One patient had a grand mal seizure, and one suffered a colonic perforation; these were felt to be treatment-related. IP fibrosis developed in 14 patients and limited repeated cyclic administration of this therapy in five patients. Two of 10 (20%) ovarian cancer patients and five of 12 (42%) colorectal cancer patients had laparoscopy- or laparotomy-documented partial responses. We conclude that LAK cells and rIL-2 can be administered IP to cancer patients, resulting in moderate to severe short-term toxicity and modest therapeutic efficacy. Further investigation of this form of adoptive immunotherapy modified to address the problem of IP fibrosis and with lower IP IL-2 doses is justified by these initial results.",458,1
"Evidence of heterogeneous mechanisms in lipoprotein lipid alterations in hyperandrogenic women. Fifty-one hyperandrogenic women had their lipoprotein lipid profiles determined. Free and albumin-bound testosterone was associated with triglycerides and with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels, percent ideal body weight, and waist/hip ratio. To gain insight into mechanisms of these lipid alterations, the women were subgrouped according to apparent source of androgen excess. Whereas all groups had low levels of high-density lipoprotein-2 cholesterol and high triglyceride concentrations, only in those with high luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratios was free and albumin-bound testosterone associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels. Relationships between percent ideal body weight and waist/hip ratios, free and albumin-bound testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, fasting insulin and 2-hour insulin levels and blood pressure are not significant in all subgroups, suggesting differing endocrinological influences and differing mechanisms for lipoprotein lipid alterations.",206,1

"Differentiated thyroid carcinomas in children and adolescents. An analysis of differentiated thyroid carcinomas in children and adolescents revealed that the incidence was 3.05% of total number of patients with differentiated thyroid cancers in all age groups. There was a female preponderance. The incidence of papillary, follicular and papillary with follicular elements was equal. There were no papillary carcinomas observed in children younger than 10 years. The predominant mode of presentation was a solitary nodule of thyroid and some of them had associated cervical adenopathy. A considerable number presented with only cervical adenopathy. The incidence of nodal metastases was 50% at time of presentation and lung involvement was present in 15% of children at the time of diagnosis. Radioiodine treatment was given in 70% of children. Ablation was achieved in 86% of patients given two doses of radioiodine (200 millicuries). The more resistant cases were those with lung and nodal metastases. There was complete ablation in 100% with only residual thyroid tissue, 83% in those with associated nodal metastases, and 57% in those with lung involvement. Average duration of follow-up was 10.3 years (range, 2 to 19 years). Recurrence rate or relapse was observed in 8.5% and was in the regional nodes. There was no recorded mortality due to the disease.",293,1
"Structural and ultrastructural study of the ovary in childhood leukemia after successful treatment. Ovarian biopsy specimens from ten girls (three postmenarcheal) who had undergone antiblastic treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and were in complete remission were examined by light microscope. The biopsy specimens from four of these patients (three postmenarcheal) were also observed by electron microscope. The structural and ultrastructural analysis showed a reduction in the number of follicles which were otherwise normal. No follicles were found in the thin sections from two of the three postmenarcheal girls, whereas normal follicles were observed in the third. The cortical stroma showed moderate to severe signs of fibrosis and changes of capillaries. All of these alterations were more evident in patients where ALL was diagnosed at an older age and this finding suggests that they are at a higher risk for low fertility or early menopause. ",178,1
"Multiple spinal epidural metastases; an unexpectedly frequent finding. In a prospective study, patients with known malignant disease who were suspected of having a spinal epidural metastasis, had myelography which was not confined to the clinically suspected site, but included at least the whole lumbar and thoracic spinal canal. Fifty four of the 106 myelograms revealed at least one epidural metastasis. Twelve of these 54 myelograms showed two separate lesions, and four myelograms showed three separate lesions. In all 16 cases with multiple lesions at least one of the lesions was asymptomatic at the time of the diagnosis. It is concluded that multiple spinal epidural metastases are of common occurrence and occur in about one third of the cases. This finding may have important clinical implications. Examination of the spinal canal for epidural metastases should not be confined to the clinically suspected site, but should include as extensive an area as possible of the spinal canal, whatever technique is to be used.",193,1
"The influence of neutralizing heparin after carotid endarterectomy on postoperative stroke and wound hematoma. The influence of neutralizing or not neutralizing heparin after carotid endarterectomy on postoperative stroke and wound hematoma is unknown. During the past 6 years some of the authors frequently gave protamine sulfate to neutralize heparin, whereas others did not unless a patch was used or wound hemostasis was not readily obtained. To determine the influence of protamine sulfate on stroke and wound hematoma the records of 697 patients having a carotid endarterectomy from January 1984 to September 1989 were reviewed. Protamine sulfate was given to 328 patients, and 369 did not receive protamine sulfate. The incidence of stroke in the two groups was 1.8% (n = 6) and 2.7% (n = 10), respectively, and the difference was not significant (p = 0.6019). Excluding three strokes that could not be related to neutralizing or not neutralizing heparin, the difference remained insignificant (1.5% vs 2.2%, p = 0.7290). The incidence of wound hematoma was 1.8% (n = 6) in patients given protamine sulfate and 6.5% (n = 24) in patients not given protamine sulfate, and this difference was significant (p = 0.0044). The difference remained significant when three hematomas not related to protamine sulfate were excluded (1.2% vs 6.2%, p = 0.0013). In patients not given protamine sulfate draining the wound lessened the incidence of wound hematoma (4.4% vs 8.6%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1475). In patients given protamine sulfate the dose of protamine sulfate (15 to 45 mg vs 50 to 75 mg) had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of stroke (0.8% vs 2.0%, p = 0.6530) or wound hematoma (1.6% vs 1.0%, p = 1.000).",471,0
"Treatment of anovulation due to polycystic ovarian syndrome by laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery. Our experience of ovarian electrocautery for the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in ten women is described. We found that nine responded favourably, either ovulating spontaneously or becoming more responsive to ovulation induction. There was a significant and persistent fall in serum testosterone levels, and a transient fall with subsequent rise in inhibin. We recommend that laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery is considered as an alternative to ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, in women with PCOS who fail to respond to clomiphene citrate. ",130,1
"Genetics of cerebrovascular disease. Stroke is a complex disease, with both genetic and environmental factors having a role in its pathogenesis. A review of past studies shows some evidence of genetic influences in the development of stroke. This is supported by studies of cardiovascular disease, which indicate major genetic influences at several levels including the development of risk factors. New approaches to phenotypic classifications, patient ascertainment, and genetic analysis will stimulate research into the role of genetics in cerebrovascular disease. ",94,0
"Elective diagnostic laparoscopy. Laparoscopy developed as a science at the turn of the century, and many scientists assisted in the evolution of this technique. However, it was many years before the multiple trocar system was developed that allowed internal organs to be moved and biopsies to be obtained. This has led to the development of numerous indications for elective diagnostic laparoscopy. Adequate preparation and attention to instrumentation ensure the safety of this operation. Elective diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful adjunct to many other diagnostic modalities such as, for instance, the assessment of abdominal pain, abdominal masses, fever of unknown origin, and gastrointestinal bleeding. In many other circumstances, such as the assessment of oncology cases, this modality is superior to conventional radiology because biopsy specimens may be obtained. If the procedure is correctly performed, the diagnostic yield is extremely high and the morbidity and mortality are low. The role of this important technique should not be underestimated by today's practicing surgeon. ",189,1
"Immunohistologic detection of the epidermal growth factor receptor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) expression was studied immunohistologically in 38 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The EGF-R was faintly expressed in basal and parabasal layers of normal esophageal epithelia and in cancer nests of 20 patients; it was strongly expressed in all areas of dysplastic epithelia and in cancer nests of 18 patients. The patients with strongly expressed EGF-R had lymph node metastases more frequently, and their prognosis was poorer than those with faintly expressed EGF-R. The EGF-R expression showed a mosaic pattern in 17 patients and a diffuse pattern in 21 patients. The patients with a mosaic pattern had lymph node metastases more frequently and a worse prognosis than those with a diffuse pattern. Expression of EGF-R in metastatic lymph nodes was similar to that in strongly expressing areas of primary cancers with a mosaic pattern. Thus EGF-R expression may be an important indicator for malignancies of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas because primary cancer cells with strongly expressed EGF-R metastasize to lymph nodes more frequently.",244,1
"Vaccines and milk immunoglobulin concentrates for prevention of infectious diarrhea. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade in developing vaccines against the most important enteric infections. Two new, widely licensed vaccines (oral Ty21a and parenteral Vi) are available against typhoid fever, and new attenuated Salmonella typhi strains are ready for testing. An engineered live orally administered cholera vaccine, CVD 103-HgR, is undergoing clinical trials for safety, immunogenicity, and transmissibility in children in areas where cholera is endemic. Multiple candidate vaccines against rotavirus, Shigella, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are in clinical trials. Newly acquired knowledge about pathogenesis and mucosal and cellular immunology, coupled with application of biotechnology, has already resulted in many candidates for vaccines, and more are expected to appear within the next few years.",170,0
"Standards for analysis of ventricular late potentials using high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography: a statement by a task force committee of the European Society of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology. Sufficient data are available to recommend the use of the high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiogram in patients recovering from myocardial infarction without bundle branch block to help determine their risk for developing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, no data are available about the extent to which pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions in patients with late potentials have an impact on the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, controlled, prospective studies are required before this issue can be resolved. As refinements in techniques evolve, it is anticipated that the clinical value of high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography will continue to increase. ",165,0
Late arterial hemorrhage secondary to a Greenfield filter requiring operative intervention. Retroperitoneal hematomas associated with Greenfield filters have been described and are generally characterized as clinically insignificant. We report a retroperitoneal hematoma that was associated with a Greenfield filter and that required operative intervention because of hemodynamic instability. At operation a lumbar arterial laceration apparently caused by a protruding filter prong was identified and ligated. The implications of this occurrence for filter placement indications are discussed. The potential life-threatening severity of filter-associated hematomas is emphasized. ,105,0
"Radiologic staging of chest in testicular seminoma. We investigated the usefulness of chest x-ray (CXR), conventional planar tomography (TOM), and computerized axial tomography (CAT) in evaluating patients with Stages I and II testicular seminoma. All patients had a CXR, and 22 patients had either TOM or CAT as part of initial staging. No occult pulmonary or mediastinal nodal disease was found during initial staging, and none of the patients manifested recurrence of tumor in these sites as a first event. Review of the literature corroborates our finding of a very small thoracic failure rate in early stage seminoma. Routine use of CAT or TOM is not indicated in staging these patients.",139,1
"Excipients in valproic acid syrup may cause diarrhea: a case report. A 5-year-old child receiving valproic acid syrup for seizure control developed diarrhea probably from the excipient ingredients. Each 5 mL of valproic acid syrup contains sucrose 3 g, glycerin 0.75 g, and sorbitol 0.75 g, providing daily amounts of 36, 9, and 9 g of sucrose, glycerin, and sorbitol, respectively. The diarrhea resolved when the child was switched to another valproic acid product. Clinicians should be aware of potential problems that may occur from excipient ingredients in pharmaceutical products when evaluating adverse effects of medications.",145,0
"Role of leukotriene B4 in granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic feline intestine. Several studies have demonstrated that granulocytes accumulate in the intestinal mucosa following ischemia/reperfusion. It has been suggested that leukotriene B4 may be released during ischemia/reperfusion and consequently may promote granulocyte infiltration into the mucosa. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (a) leukotriene B4 is produced in the gut mucosa during ischemia and reperfusion, and (b) inhibition of leukotriene B4 attenuates granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic intestinal mucosa. Isolated segments of cat intestine were subjected to 3 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. Mucosal samples were obtained during baseline, ischemia at 3 hours and reperfusion at 1 hour. Leukotriene B4 production was determined by radioimmunoassay. Tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity was used to quantitate granulocyte accumulation in the mucosal samples. In untreated animals, mucosal leukotriene B4 concentration was higher at reperfusion compared with baseline levels. The reperfusion-induced increase in mucosal leukotriene B4 was entirely prevented by pretreatment with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or L663,536 (Merck-Frosst, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), two potent lipoxygenase inhibitors. Both lipoxygenase inhibitors, as well as leukotriene B4 antagonist (SC-41930) significantly attenuated the reperfusion-induced infiltration of granulocytes. These results indicate that leukotriene B4 plays an important role in mediating the granulocyte accumulation elicited by reperfusion of the ischemic bowel.",347,0
"Symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trials. The possible benefit of carotid endarterectomy in stroke prevention is being evaluated in three major clinical trials. To date, the European Carotid Surgery Trial has randomized 2,200 patients, 30% of whom have a carotid stenosis of greater than 70% appropriate to their symptoms. The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial has randomized 1,000 patients, of whom more than half have this severity of appropriate stenosis. Quality control and the evaluation of outcome events in this trial is achieved by a three-tier review, including review by medical and surgical adjudicators who are blinded to the treatment arm of each patient. Baseline characteristics of the patients eligible but not randomized are similar to those of patients who have been randomized. Two percent of the patients randomized to the surgical arm have declined surgery and crossed over to the medical arm, and 3% have elected surgery after randomization to the medical arm. Both of these studies, as well as a Veterans Administration trial, are continuing to randomize patients.",218,0
"A case of classical mycosis fungoides associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I. A 72-year-old male patient from north-eastern Iran developed the typical clinical and histopathological features of mycosis fungoides with lymphadenopathy, but without any other systemic involvement. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) antibodies were detected in the patient's serum by two different ELISAs and by Western blot using purified viral particles from MT-2 culture supernatants. Cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes were positive for labelling with anti-HTLV-I serum. Southern blot hybridization of DNA extracted from a skin tumour and from an involved lymph node revealed integrated proviral DNA with identical restriction patterns. This case supports a relationship between mycosis fungoides and HTLV-I and may indicate a new region of endemic HTLV-I infection.",180,1
"Indwelling epidural catheters for pain control in gynecologic cancer patients. Seven patients with severe pain caused by an advanced, incurable gynecologic malignancy were treated with an indwelling epidural catheter connected to an implantable subcutaneous port through which morphine was infused. There were few major complications associated with insertion or maintenance of the system. The average usage was 60 days, although the system functioned continuously for 6 months in one patient. Pain distribution in these women ranged from the upper abdomen to the lower extremities. All patients, including one with liver metastases, reported good to excellent pain control with the epidural narcotics. Two subjects with upper abdominal pain occasionally required supplemental oral oxycodone, but the other five patients had adequate pain relief with the epidural system alone. The indwelling epidural system provides excellent analgesia for patients with advanced, incurable gynecologic cancer.",177,1
"The role of aspiration cytologic examination in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast. A study of 2,000 patients who had undergone fine needle aspiration of a solid lump of the breast was conducted to determine the accuracy of this technique. During the period 1982 to 1989, all patients with a solid mammary mass, presenting to a specialized breast unit were initially investigated by fine needle aspiration cytologic examination (FNAC). To date, we present data on 2,000 consecutive aspirations with matching histologic diagnosis on the excised pathologic specimens. In particular, the relationship between tumor histologic factors and the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis was examined. The sensitivity of FNAC in the diagnosis of a malignant growth was 84 per cent; this represents first aspiration results only. The specificity was more than 99 per cent. The rate of acellular or unsatisfactory aspirations was 12 per cent. We had a positive predictive rate for diagnosis in carcinoma of the breast of almost 95 per cent. The diagnosis of lobular and in situ patterns of disease was questioned, with three of three in situ lesions and ten of 23 lobular lesions missed by FNAC. We do not recommend that FNAC replace excision biopsy and frozen section in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast.",271,1
"Treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with continuous intraventricular infusion of recombinant interleukin-2. A 42-year-old man developed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis 6 years after treatment of a malignant melanoma. He was treated with two courses of recombinant interleukin-2, administered as a continuous intraventricular infusion (6 X 10E5 U/24 h) during 5 days. During the first day of the first course he also received 5 X 10E9 lymphokine-activated killer cells intraventricularly. This gave rise to a severe elevation of intracranial pressure, with headaches and meningismus. During the second course no LAK cells were administered. This course was tolerated much better. The neurological status did not change during the treatment. Recombinant interleukin-2 levels were maintained at about 300 U/mL during both courses.",182,1
"Multifocal colitis associated with an epidemic of chronic diarrhea. An outbreak of a chronic diarrheal syndrome was detected between May and August 1987 in rural Henderson County, Illinois. Seventy-two individuals were affected. Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak. Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation. Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40). Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism. Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content. Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal. Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients. Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles. After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea. One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years. We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis. This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea.",284,0
"Hormonal and enzymatic parameters of hepatic regeneration in patients undergoing major liver resections. Thirteen patients who underwent 40% to 80% removal of their livers had blood samples drawn initially and daily on postoperative days 1 to 7. The enzyme marker of heightened polyamine metabolism, ornithine decarboxylase, and the indicator of DNA synthesis, thymidine kinase, were measured. In addition, the hormones (insulin, glucagon, estradiol and androgen), which in animals are known to reflect and possibly modulate regeneration, were measured. Changes in all these indices followed the same pattern as in rats, dogs and swine but at a slower rate. Ornithine decarboxylase and estradiol increased within 24 hr, but thymidine kinase and insulin rises did not become statistically significant until 3 to 5 days. Using these plasma or serum indices as surrogate measures of biochemical events in the liver itself, regeneration reached a maximum after 4 or 5 days. By computed tomography scan analysis, restoration of hepatic cell mass was not complete until 3 wk.",217,1
"Xeroderma pigmentosum: review and report of a case. Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare inherited dermatosis that provides insight into the basic mechanism of carcinogenesis. It is a model disorder linking defective DNA repair with clinical abnormalities and neoplasia. UV light-induced damage to the skin begins early and results in multiple benign and malignant skin tumors, especially in sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinomas of the anterior third of the tongue, occur with greatly increased frequency. A patient with multiple facial neoplasia and oral manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum is presented. The role of the dentist in surveillance of oral and perioral structures is emphasized. The dentist is advised against the use of UV light-curing units in these patients because UV-induced epithelial damage may cause dysplasia when DNA repair mechanisms are dysfunctional. ",176,1
"Evoked potentials in assessment and follow-up of patients with Wilson's disease. Treatment of 9 patients with Wilson's disease was prospectively studied with evoked potentials and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Oral penicillamine therapy led to a decrease in auditory brainstem (ABP) and somatosensory (SEP) conduction times in 6 and 4 neurologically symptomatic patients, respectively. ABP and SEP were normal in 3 other symptom-free patients. MRI showed cerebral lesions in 4 of 7 patients. Quantified indices of brain atrophy were unaffected by treatment. ABP and SEP may reveal a reversible component of the disease that cannot be detected by MRI, and may be a more sensitive measure of treatment efficacy.",150,0
"An immunohistochemical evaluation of progesterone receptor in frozen sections, paraffin sections, and cytologic imprints of breast carcinomas. Two monoclonal antibodies to progesterone receptor (PR), JZB39 and KD68, were used for the immunocytochemical visualization of PR in different kinds of breast cancer specimens including (1) cryostat sections of tumors frozen at -80 degrees C; (2) paraffin sections of tumors fixed in formalin or in Bouin's fixative for varying periods of time at room temperature or at 4 degrees C; and (3) imprints and cryostat sections prepared from the tissue used for frozen section diagnosis and stored at -80 degrees C after fixation in Zamboni's solution. Sections of conventionally frozen specimens as well as imprints and cryostat sections stored for varying periods of time were stained with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, whereas the avidin-biotin technique was used for paraffin sections. In all types of specimens the PR immunostaining was localized to the nuclei of carcinoma cells and displayed considerable heterogeneity both in intensity and in distribution of positive cells. Close correspondence was found between the different immunohistochemical techniques as well as between immunostaining and steroid-binding assays. PR staining was more frequently positive in well-differentiated than in moderately or poorly differentiated carcinomas, whereas no meaningful correlation was found between PR staining and extent of the disease. Similar results were obtained with the immunostaining of estrogen receptor in the same material using monoclonal antibodies H222 and D75P3 gamma. Thus, by choosing the technique that best suits the type of specimen available, it is possible to obtain valid information on the receptor status of any breast carcinoma, regardless of its size and clinical presentation.",351,1

"Second cancer after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix. Radiation-induced cancers after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix were investigated on 11,855 patients including 5725 patients treated with radiation therapy alone, 1969 postoperative radiation therapy and 4161 surgery alone. The observed-to-expected ratios of the second primary cancer was 0.933 for the patients with radiation therapy alone and 1.074 for the patients with postoperative radiation therapy, respectively. No significant increase was observed in the risk of second primary cancers when all sites were combined. However, assessing on site by site basis, significant excess was noted for the rectum cancer, leukemia, and bladder cancer for the radiation therapy group but not for the surgery group. A significant excess of lung cancer was observed in both radiation therapy and surgery groups, which was attributed to some other causative factors. Radiation-induced cancers were suggested to develop apparently in organs involved in the irradiated field.",205,1
"The elusive colonic malignancy. A need for definitive preoperative localization. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the standard of practice for the diagnosis of colonic malignancies. Unfortunately, the inability of endoscopy to obtain precise distance measurements from the anal verge can make localization of lesions at operation difficult. For this reason, preoperative barium enema or intraoperative colonoscopy have been advocated to further pinpoint the sites of those lesions not thought to be easily located at operation. Five patients are presented in whom malignant lesions of the colon were diagnosed and verified histologically, but were later undetectable at operation or subsequent colonoscopic examinations. Four of these patients underwent laparotomy and three received colon resections. None of these patients' tumors were identified during intraoperative colonoscopy, in the resected bowel on pathologic examination, or on follow-up colonoscopy. A fifth patient is presented who spontaneously passed a polyp containing invasive adenocarcinoma, but multiple colonoscopic examinations have failed to identify the site of the lesion. To date, none of these tumors have recurred with periods of follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years. These patients demonstrate a poorly documented and little understood aspect of the behavior of colonic malignancies, i.e., the ability to spontaneously regress or slough from the bowel wall. Based on these instances, localization of potentially malignant colon lesions is recommended with submucosal dye injections at initial endoscopy or with colonoscopy in the operating room immediately prior to operation.",294,1
"Coronary angioplasty after coronary bypass surgery: initial results and late outcome in 422 patients. From 1978 to 1988, coronary angioplasty was performed in 422 patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery (264 patients with native coronary artery angioplasty and 158 patients with graft angioplasty). Angioplasty was successful in 84%, unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 11% and complicated by one or more major cardiac events in 5% (myocardial infarction 5%, emergency bypass surgery 2% and death 0.2%). Follow-up data were obtained in 99% of 356 patients with successful angioplasty. At a mean of 33 +/- 26 months, 92% were alive, 73% had improvement in angina and 61% were free of angina. One or more of the following late events occurred in 67 patients (19%): myocardial infarction (6%), elective reoperation (13%) and cardiac death (6%). Repeat angioplasty was performed in 27%, with a success rate of 89% and no deaths. Initial success rates were equal in native vessel versus graft angioplasty, but late outcome was less favorable with the latter because of a higher rate of infarction (11% versus 4%, p less than 0.05) and need for reoperation (19% versus 10%, p less than 0.05). The initial success rate was higher in vein grafts less than 1 year old compared with grafts 1 to 4 years or greater than 4 years after operation (92% versus 85% versus 83%, respectively) and adverse late events were less frequent after angioplasty in recent vein grafts (less than 1 year 13%, 1 to 4 years 35%, greater than 4 years 29%; less than 1 versus greater than 1 year, p less than 0.05).",434,0

"A comparative analysis of three different techniques for the detection of breast cancer cells in bone marrow. Three different methods, morphologic, immunocytochemic, and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FC) analysis, were compared with respect to their efficiency in detecting breast cancer cells in bone marrow. In the first series of experiments, the three techniques were compared using bone marrow cells artificially mixed with a known amount of breast cancer cells, whereas in a second series bone marrow from breast cancer patients with bone metastases were used. The following results were obtained: When mixtures of the first series were analyzed, FC analysis detected from 1% to 10% of breast cancer cells in bone marrow (0.2% was a border line value), the morphologic method detected from 0.05% to 10%, and the immunocytochemic method, which was clearly superior, detected breast cancer cells in all mixtures (from 0.00025% to 10%). It was noted that, with both the morphologic and immunocytochemic methods, the percentage of breast cancer cells detected was 2 to 360 times higher than the percentage of added cells, and enrichment was inversely proportional to the percentage of added cells. This result could be a result of different separation of cells during centrifugation due to the different density of breast cancer cells. The superiority of the immunocytochemic method was confirmed in the second series of experiments.",289,1
"Stroke in pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In a 4 1/2-year period, 4 of 68 children in a longitudinal study of neurological complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had clinical and/or neuroradiological evidence of stroke, yielding a clinical incidence of stroke in this population of 1.3% per year. During this period, 32 subjects died, and permission for autopsy was granted in 18 of the patients, including 3 of 4 who had clinical evidence of stroke. The prevalence of cerebrovascular pathological features in our consecutive autopsy series was higher than the clinical incidence. At autopsy cerebrovascular disease was documented in 6 (24%) of 25 children with HIV infection, including all 3 children who had clinical evidence of stroke. Four patients had intracerebral hemorrhages, 6 patients had nonhemorrhagic infarcts, and 3 had both. Hemorrhage was catastrophic in 1 child and clinically silent in 3 children, all of whom had immune thrombocytopenia. One child had an arteriopathy that affected meningocerebral arteries. In another child, the arteries of the circle of Willis were aneurysmally dilated. Two children had coexisting cardiomyopathy and subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy with vascular proliferation. These results suggest that stroke should be considered when children with HIV infection develop focal neurological signs.",285,0
"Massive splenomegaly. Superior results with a combined endovascular and operative approach. Splenectomy for massive splenomegaly (drained splenic weight, greater than 1000 g) has an uncommonly high morbidity and mortality because of technical challenges and problems of hemostasis. In a group of 10 patients with massive splenomegaly due to myeloproliferative disorders (average splenic weight, 4193 g), we developed a management algorithm based on preoperative angiographic embolization of the splenic artery. Average operating time was 1.7 hours (range, 1 to 2.5 hours). Average blood loss was 528 mL; six of the 10 patients had blood loss less than 250 mL.

"No effect of experimental noise exposure on human pregnancy. The effect of experimental noise exposure (15 minutes of 90-dB white noise via headphones) was examined on systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures; heart rate; and stress hormones (ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) in normotensive and hypertensive pregnant women. No significant effects induced by noise exposure could be registered in these variables. Fetal and uterine blood circulation was also examined with a duplex pulsed Doppler system. No changes were seen on the fetal side as measured from the descending aorta in blood flow velocity (cm/second) or pulsatility or resistance indexes in either normotensive or hypertensive pregnancy. The only change observed was an increase in fetal heart rate in normotensive pregnancy. However, this increase could not be confirmed by cardiotocographic registration and is not clinically important. Uterine blood circulation was recorded from the proximal uterine artery on the placental side, and no effect of exposure was seen on pulsatility or resistance indexes.",214,0
"Silent myocardial ischemia during rehabilitation for cerebrovascular disease. In asymptomatic patients the importance of silent ischemic ST-T wave changes on Holter monitoring is known to be a significant predictive variable for one-year mortality of postmyocardial infarction patients. This case report represents the uses of ambulatory ECG to detect ischemic ST changes in patients who have had recent strokes. The cases reported here of silent myocardiac ischemia in stroke patients reflect previous reports in which 70% of the ischemic episodes in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease are not associated with angina and in which approximately 10% to 15% of acute myocardial infarctions are silent. We now believe that the incidence of ""silent"" ischemia may be precipitated in poststroke patients during their rehabilitation program. This belief is supported by two main factors. First, a high level of personally relevant mental stress exists which activates the sympathoadrenal system, which may lead to myocardial ischemia. Second, some stroke patients become aphasic and are unable to communicate adequately even if they experience angina symptoms. We have found that poststroke, most patients could not undergo exercise treadmill testing secondary to a variety of factors: inability to coordinate limbs, poor endurance, inability to follow directions, and/or lack of attention. We now propose that 24-hour monitoring for ST-T wave changes poststroke should be considered as part of a vigorous investigation for myocardial ischemia during the rehabilitation of these patients because they have an increased risk of cardiac morbidity.",297,0
"Improved survival with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of medulloblastoma. Between 1975 and 1989, 108 children with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MB/PNET) of the posterior fossa were treated at the authors' institution. The patients were managed uniformly, and treatment included aggressive surgical resections, postoperative staging evaluations for extent of disease, and craniospinal radiation therapy with a local boost. Beginning in 1983, children with MB/PNET were prospectively assigned to risk groups; those with ""standard-risk"" MB/PNET were treated with radiation therapy alone, while those in the ""poor-risk"" group received similar radiation therapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy with 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU), vincristine, and cisplatin. The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival rate for all patients treated between 1975 and 1982 was 68%, and 73% when patients who died within 2 weeks after operation were excluded. This survival rate was statistically better for patients treated after 1982 (82%) compared to those treated between 1975 and 1982 (49%) (p less than 0.004). There was no difference in disease-free survival rates over time for children with standard-risk factors; however, there was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate for poor-risk patients treated prior to 1982 (35%) compared to those treated later (87%) (p less than 0.001). For the group as a whole, a younger age at diagnosis correlated with a poorer survival rate; however, this relationship between age and outcome was significant only for children treated before 1983 (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrated an encouraging survival rate for children with MB/PNET, especially those treated with aggressive surgical resection followed by both radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The results strongly suggest that chemotherapy has a role for some, and possibly all, children with MB/PNET.",463,1

We analyzed the serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) by boronate affinity chromatography to ascertain the presence or absence of any changes in the binding properties of gamma-GT toward boronate gels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis, and in normal controls. The mean gamma-GT activity ratio of the bound (peak 2) and nonbound (peak 1) fraction in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly higher than that in patients with liver cirrhosis or in normal controls. Thus, the gamma-GT, which has adjacent cis-hydroxyl groups in its carbohydrate moieties, was found to increase in the serum of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The positivity rate was examined in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis, using a cut-off level for the peak 2:peak 1 ratio of 1.05 (mean + 2 SD of liver cirrhosis). Nineteen (42.2%) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had a ratio of peak 2:peak 1 higher than 1.05. Nine of the 19 patients who had serum alpha-fetoprotein levels below 100 ng/ml had an elevated peak 2:peak 1 ratio. In total, 77.8% of the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma could be detected by a combination of these two markers. Three patients who had developed hepatocellular carcinoma during the course of cirrhosis but remained negative for alpha-fetoprotein throughout the course developed higher levels of peak 2:peak 1 ratio when hepatocellular carcinoma occurred. These results indicate that the two markers, the peak 2:peak 1 ratio of serum gamma-GT activity and serum alpha-fetoprotein level, may be considered to serve as complementary markers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.",389,1
"Preoperative chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil) and radiation therapy in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase II study of the Lung Cancer Study Group. The Lung Cancer Study Group conducted a phase II pilot study of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) before surgery in 85 eligible patients with non-small-cell cancer limited to the chest but in whom attempted resection would have been likely to leave residual disease (advanced stage IIIA and minimal stage IIIB disease). Cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 29; fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per 24 hours, was administered as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 4 and on days 29 through 32; and thoracic radiation, 30 Gy in 15 fractions, was administered on days 1 through 19. Two patients achieved a complete response and 46 patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 56%. Toxicity from chemoradiotherapy was moderate but acceptable. Eight weeks after therapy was initiated, 54 patients underwent thoracotomy and tumor resection was attempted: 29 (34%) had complete resection and 15 (18%) had incomplete resection. Although surgical dissection was generally more difficult than in patients not pretreated with chemoradiotherapy, there was no apparent increase in postoperative complications. In 8 patients (9%), no viable tumor was detected pathologically in the resection specimen. Of the 18 patients whose tumors were completely resected and had disease recurrence, none had recurrence only in the chest, 12 (67%) had recurrence only in distant sites, and 3 developed second primary tumors. Median survival of all patients was 13 months. The overall results do not indicate a major benefit from this preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen in patients with advanced but potentially resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. These results suggest a need to define better the relative roles of preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.",427,1
"Cerebellar and frontal hypometabolism in alcoholic cerebellar degeneration studied with positron emission tomography. Local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose was studied utilizing 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography (PET) in 14 chronically alcohol-dependent patients and 8 normal control subjects of similar age and sex. Nine of the 14 patients (Group A) had clinical signs of alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, and the remaining 5 (Group B) did not have signs of alcoholic cerebellar degeneration. PET studies of Group A revealed significantly decreased local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in the superior cerebellar vermis in comparison with the normal control subjects. Group B did not show decreased rates in the cerebellum. Both Groups A and B showed decreased local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose bilaterally in the medial frontal area of the cerebral cortex in comparison with the normal control subjects. The severity of the clinical neurological impairment was significantly correlated with the degree of hypometabolism in both the superior cerebellar vermis and the medial frontal region of the cerebral cortex. The degree of atrophy detected in computed tomography scans was significantly correlated with local cerebral metabolic rates in the medial frontal area of the cerebral cortex, but not in the cerebellum. The data indicate that hypometabolism in the superior cerebellar vermis closely follows clinical symptomatology in patients with alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, and does not occur in alcohol-dependent patients without clinical evidence of cerebellar dysfunction. Hypometabolism in the medial frontal region of the cerebral cortex is a prominent finding in alcohol-dependent patients with or without alcoholic cerebellar degeneration.",312,0
"Corporate-sponsored breast cancer screening at the work site: results of a statewide program. Mobile screening mammography was offered to 3,627 employees of a large corporation in Pennsylvania and Delaware. The examination was available to women employees or employee spouses aged 35 years and older. Women were charged $30 for a standard two-view examination. They also received health education materials on mammography and breast self-examination. The remaining costs of the program were underwritten by the corporation. During this program, 3,627 mammographic studies were performed; 63 biopsies were recommended. Fifty-seven biopsies were performed, and nine cancers were diagnosed. Costs of this program are presented in detail. The authors conclude that mobile screening programs at the work site provide an inexpensive, convenient alternative to more traditional screening programs. The inherent advantages of this program are the low cost, the relative ease with which the examination can be performed, and the positive role that corporate medical personnel assume in encouraging individual and group participation.",207,1
"Brief intensive chemotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase II study of the weekly CODE regimen. Fifty-three patients, 17 with stage IIIB and 36 with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer, were given CODE (cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide) plus antibiotic prophylaxis and an antiemetic regimen in an intensive chemotherapy program emphasizing weekly treatment and a planned brief duration (9-12 weeks); for 45 of these patients, the CODE program also included antifungal prophylaxis and supportive corticosteroids. Of the total study population, 33 patients (62%) responded to treatment, including five (9%) with complete response. The median survival for the entire group was 42 weeks (55 weeks for those with stage IIIB and 39 weeks for those with stage IV). More than 40% were alive at 1 year. Comparison of granulocyte counts of patients receiving prednisone with those of the subgroup to whom no corticosteroids were given showed less granulocytopenia for those receiving prednisone. Use of prednisone thus allowed improved delivery of myelosuppressive drugs. CODE was halted in nine patients because of disease progression. Although more constitutional side effects are associated with weekly chemotherapy than with standard chemotherapy, only 12 of the remaining 44 patients (27%) failed to receive at least 9 weeks of treatment. Serious toxicity was uncommon: There were no treatment-related deaths and only three episodes of neutropenia with fever. CODE is a novel treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer that this pilot study provided entirely in an outpatient setting over a 9-12 week period with an acceptable incidence of toxicity and a promising level of efficacy. Additional testing and comparison with other regimens or supportive care alone are warranted.",377,1
Right-left disorientation in dementia of the Alzheimer type. We demonstrated that right-left orientation (R/L-O) on a confronting subject is more impaired in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type than in patients with multi-infarct dementia of comparable degree of dementia. The impairment in R/L-O is independent of aphasia and spatial disorientation. ,77,0
"Central nervous system bioaminergic responses to mechanical trauma. An experimental study. Changes in biogenic amines in the brain and spinal cord following penetrating injury were studied in male Wistar rats using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Rapid increase in hemispheric concentration of these substances was noted beginning shortly after trauma. This trend continued until they were about three to four times control levels by about 24 to 48 hours postinjury. In the spinal cord, however, there was an initial sharp reduction in regional concentrations 2 hours postinjury followed by a slow rise thereafter. By 48 hours postinjury, levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin of the cords of injured animals were still less than those of nontraumatized controls. This variation in the central nervous system bioaminergic response with the level of injury raises questions as to its precise role in neurological damage following mechanical insult.",181,0
"An improved photochemical model of embolic cerebral infarction in rats. To provide further evidence that the multiple cerebral infarcts found in rats following photochemical damage to the carotid artery are caused by emboli and to eliminate the systemic hypotension and heating of the blood reported with the previous photochemical embolic stroke model (rose bengal and a green laser), I have modified the photochemical technique. Brain pathology was studied in 18 Wistar rats following carotid artery irradiation with a red laser (632 nm) at powers ranging from 100 to 800 mW/cm2 for 10 or 20 minutes following the injection of the photosensitizing dye Photofrin II. Multiple cerebral arterioles were occluded by platelet aggregates containing frequent erythrocytes and leukocytes, identical to the thrombotic material in the carotid artery but different from the platelet aggregates seen in the carotid artery and the brain in the rose bengal model. Eighty infarcts were distributed randomly throughout the brain ipsilateral to the nonocclusive carotid thrombus. Significant heating (0.5 degree C or more) of the blood occurred only with laser powers higher (1,600 mW/cm2) or laser irradiations longer (25 minutes) than those used in the improved model of embolic stroke. This model mimics one mechanism of stroke in humans and provides a means to study systematically the morphological evolution of small cerebral infarcts.",287,0
"Changes in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in acute viral hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. Forty-four male and female subjects aged 22-57 years were studied. Thirteen patients had acute viral hepatitis, and eleven patients had cholestatic jaundice due to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Twenty healthy volunteers who served as controls were also included. In hepatitis patients, the mean plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-phospholipid/phospholipid (HDLPL/PL) ratio were reduced, and HDL-cholesterol (HDLC), HDL-phospholipid (HDLPL) and the phospholipid/total cholesterol (PL/TC) ratio were normal, while total phospholipid (PL) levels and the HDLC/TC ratio were significantly increased compared to the control values. In patients with cholestatic jaundice the mean plasma total cholesterol, phospholipid and HDLC levels were elevated, and HDLPL/PL, HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC remained normal compared to the control values. A comparison within the patient groups showed that plasma TC, PL and HDLC levels were significantly increased in cholestatic jaundice when compared with the corresponding levels in hepatitis patients. The mean plasma levels of HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC did not show any significant variation within the patient groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) correlated positively with TC, and total protein correlated negatively with TC and HDLPL, while albumin correlated negatively with TC, HDLC and HDLPL in cholestatic jaundice. Alanine amino-transferase (ALAT) also correlated positively with PL in cholestatic jaundice, while albumin correlated positively with TC in hepatitis. The results suggest that lipoproteins might be metabolized differently in these two forms of cholestasis.",365,1
"Papillary endothelial hyperplasia in the thyroid following fine-needle aspiration. A 74-year-old woman was found to have exuberant papillary endothelial hyperplasia within her thyroid gland subsequent to multiple fine-needle aspiration biopsies of a Hurthle cell neoplasm. To our knowledge, this histologic alteration in the thyroid has not been previously reported. We describe this unusual complication following fine-needle aspiration, and we delineate the clinicopathologic and differential diagnostic features.",93,1
"Body position changes redistribute lung computed-tomographic density in patients with acute respiratory failure. Ten patients with parenchymal acute respiratory failure (ARF) underwent computed tomography (CT) scans while in the supine and prone positions. At equal levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, the authors measured the changes of CT density in dorsal and ventral basilar lung regions induced by the change of position as well as alterations of gas exchange. The level of venous admixture did not change with body position. The CT scan image of each lung was fractionated into ten levels from dorsal to ventral, each constituting 10% of the lung height. After measuring each lung fraction, the volume, the average CT number, its frequency distribution, and the expected normal value, we computed the lung tissue mass, the excess tissue mass, and the fraction of normally inflated tissue (excess tissue mass = amount of ""tissue,"" which includes edema, cells, and blood in excess of the expected normal value). We also estimated the superimposed hydrostatic pressure on each lung region. We found that the excess lung tissue mass is independent of position. However, in patients in the supine position, lung CT density increased and regional inflation decreased from ventral to dorsal, suggesting progressive deflation of gas-containing alveoli along the gravity gradient. A similar ventral-dorsal deflation pattern occurred within 10 min in patients in the prone position. We conclude that the lung in patients with ARF behaves like an elastic body with a diffusely increased mass; dependent lung regions are compressed by the pressure of overlying structures.",315,0
"Miliary tuberculosis presenting as hepatic and renal failure. A 67-year-old man developed hepatic and renal failure over a six-day period. Despite full supportive measures, he died on his 11th day of hospitalization with fulminant DIC and hepatic, renal, and respiratory failure. Postmortem examination revealed acid-fast bacilli in virtually all organ systems. Miliary tuberculosis should be considered as a potentially treatable cause of hepatic failure.",92,0
"Evaluation of in vitro bromodeoxyuridine labeling of breast carcinomas with the use of a commercial kit. The prognostic significance of S-phase fraction analyses of breast carcinomas has been reported by several investigators. The Cell Proliferation Kit (Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL), which uses in vitro bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) labeling to evaluate cell cycle kinetics without a flow cytometer or radioisotopes, simplifies this assay for the clinical-based laboratory by providing standardized reagents and recommended methods. This study was performed to determine whether data derived from its use were comparable to published S-phase data from the use of thymidine labeling, BRDU, or other methods on breast carcinomas. Primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas (n = 142) and primary lobular carcinomas (n = 6) showed mean and median BRDU labeling of 4.63% and 3%, 1.3% and 1%, respectively, with a range of 0-28%. Benign lesions always had less than 3% BRDU uptake (n = 21). Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status correlated with BRDU labeling (P less than 0.05), with the highest S-phase fractions in ER- and PR-negative tumors. Correlations between BRDU uptake and histologic tumor type or size were observed. Significant correlations between BRDU uptake and lymph node status, patient age, or histologic tumor grade were not observed. S-phase studies of breast carcinomas using other techniques have shown similar data, therefore, the Cell Proliferation Kit appears to be a practical and useful method for in vitro S-phase analysis that allows concomitant histologic examination of the same tumor tissue sample.",360,1
"Remodeling of the rat right and left ventricles in experimental hypertension. Pathological left ventricular hypertrophy in renovascular hypertension is associated with the accumulation of fibrillar collagen within the extracellular space and around intramyocardial coronary arteries. Even though the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was previously found to attenuate this interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, the relative importance of arterial and ventricular systolic pressures versus circulating angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone (AL) in promoting hypertrophy and collagen accumulation in renovascular hypertension is uncertain. By drawing on the in-parallel arrangement of the right and left ventricles, with respect to their coronary circulation, and the in-series mechanical alignment of the ventricles, with a pressure-overloaded left and a normotensive right ventricle, this study sought to address this uncertainty. Three models of experimental hypertension, each having a different circulating AII and AL profile, were examined and compared with their controls: renovascular hypertension, where both AII and AL are increased; infrarenal aorta banding, where AII and AL are normal; and a chronic infusion of AL, where AII is suppressed or normal and AL is increased. In renovascular hypertension, as well as with AL, we found a significant rise in the interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area of the pressure-overloaded, hypertrophied left ventricle as well as the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right ventricle. This remodeling was not seen in either ventricle with infrarenal aorta banding despite comparable systemic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, in experimental arterial hypertension in the rat, myocyte and nonmyocyte compartments of the myocardium are under separate controls: myocyte hypertrophy is most closely related to ventricular loading while circulating AII and AL, acting alone or in concert with other humoral factors, regulate the accumulation of collagen within the right and left ventricles.

"Major histocompatibility complex genes and susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus. Susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)--encoded genes. We have used nucleotide sequence analysis to better define the disease-associated MHC alleles. HLA-DR2, DQw1, and especially the rare allele DQ beta 1. AZH confer high relative risk (RR = 14) for lupus nephritis in a Caucasian population of patients. Pilot studies using historical controls suggest that these genes also confer a high risk in non-Caucasian ethnic groups (RR = 24-78). We have found that DR4 is significantly decreased in patients with lupus nephritis. Fifty percent of the patients with lupus nephritis had either the DQ beta 1.1, the DQ beta 1.AZH, or the DQ beta 1.9 alleles. These alleles share amino acid residues that have been predicted to be the contact points for antigen and the T cell receptor. These HLA alleles appear to have a direct role in the predisposition to lupus nephritis, whereas DR4 may have a ""protective"" effect.",233,0
"'High single-dose' European PUVA regimen also causes an excess of non-melanoma skin cancer. We report the results of a long-term (12.8 years) follow-up study of the detection of malignant and benign skin tumours in patients with psoriasis, who were treated with PUVA according to the European, 'high single-dose' regimen. A total of 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 24 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) were diagnosed in 11 of 260 patients. The incidence of both SCC and BCC was increased in comparison with the general Dutch population. The ratio of SCC to BCC in the general population was 1:8 but was 1:2.5 in our study group. A positive correlation was observed between the development of SCC and the total UVA dosage, the age of the patient at the start of the PUVA treatment and a history of arsenic use. This dose-related increase in the incidence of SCC, reported in studies from the U.S.A., has not been found in earlier European studies. The average time period between the start of PUVA therapy and the diagnosis of the first malignant skin tumour was 6.0 years for SCC and 4.7 years for BCC. Among the 49 benign skin tumours were actinic keratoses, a keratoacanthoma and 'PUVA keratoses', a newly described hyperkeratotic lesion, especially found in PUVA-treated patients.",309,1
"Parental age in sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma. Of 104 children with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma born between 1945 and 1970, we studied the age of their parents at the birth and compared this age with the mean age of parents at the birth of their children during the same period in The Netherlands. The mean age of fathers at the birth of their children with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma (33.7 years) was significantly higher than the mean age of fathers at the birth of their children in the general population (32.5 years) (P less than .05, one sided). Similarly, the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma (31.2 years) was significantly higher than the mean age of mothers at the birth of their children in the general population (29.5 years) (P less than .05, one sided). We further analyzed this parental age factor by measuring the relative risk of age groups and comparing the incidence of sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma in the various parental age groups with the incidence of sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma in the total population. Mothers 35 years of age or older had a relative risk of 1.7 to have a child with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma compared with mothers in the population in general (P = .006, one sided). Similarly, fathers 50 years of age or older had a relative risk of 5.0 to have a child with sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma compared with fathers in the population in general (P = .04, one sided). No parental age effect was found in children with nonhereditary retinoblastoma. We conclude that a high paternal and a high maternal age are significant risk factors for sporadic hereditary retinoblastoma.",362,1
"Endoscopic ultrasonography for the evaluation of smooth muscle tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract: an experience with 42 cases. Before surgery, 12 patients with suspected leiomyoma and 12 patients with suspected leiomyosarcoma were studied by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), endoscopy, and barium swallow. The results were correlated with surgery and histology. Ten leiomyomas, one benign gastric ulcer, one carcinoid metastasis, eight leiomyosarcomas, two leiomyoblastomas, one mucus secreting adenocarcinoma, and one bronchial carcinoma were diagnosed. Eighteen additional patients suspected to have benign submucosal lesions by endoscopy and barium meal were treated non-surgically, and studied by EUS and CT. EUS was superior to other imaging techniques in the detection, staging, and follow-up of submucosal smooth muscle tumors because of clear imaging of the intramural abnormality and adjacent lymph nodes.",200,1
"Mini-perforation of the colon--not all postpolypectomy perforations require laparotomy. In a 10-year experience with 4,784 consecutive colonoscopic polypectomies, the need for operative intervention in just two of seven perforations indicates that patients with specially defined, limited perforations can usually be treated nonoperatively. This specific complication, which has been termed ""mini-perforation,"" is generally detected within 6-24 hours of polypectomy, and is characterized by local pain and tenderness, without signs of diffuse or spreading peritoneal irritation. Free intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal air on x-ray documents the actual perforation. Complete resolution of symptoms within 24-48 hours confirms the diagnosis of ""mini-perforation."" Success depends on good bowel preparation for colonoscopy, and early recognition of perforation, with institution of bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics. The ""mini-perforation"" spontaneously closes, probably by omental adherence. Frequent serial clinical examinations are mandatory so that frank perforation with advancing peritonitis will be promptly recognized and treated surgically. An understanding of the three levels of cautery injury to the colon wall--""serosal burn,"" ""mini-perforation,"" and ""frank perforation"" are essential in managing the complications of colonoscopic polypectomy.",266,0
"Comparative in situ hybridisation study of juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis in Papua New Guinea and Australia. A comparative study of cases of juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis from Papua New Guinea (n = 3) and Brisbane, Australia (n = 9) was carried out. In situ hybridisation reactions for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 occurred in 11 cases. All three cases from Papua New Guinea and eight from Australia gave positive signals. A negative reaction was observed in one Australian case. The intensity of the reaction was strong in seven cases, moderate in one, and weak in three. An equivocal reaction was also noted with probes for types 16 and 18, and types 31, 33, and 35 in two cases from Australia and one from Papua New Guinea. It is concluded that as similar staining patterns and intensities occurred in cases from both areas, the aetiology is the same. The equivocal reactions noted in three cases were probably due to cross hybridisation rather than multiple infection.",221,1
"Human hepatic regenerative stimulator substance: partial purification and biological characterization of hepatic stimulator substance from human fetal liver cells. Current support or replacement therapies for fulminant acute hepatic failure are frequently very disappointing. In this study, human hepatic stimulator substance--a liver-specific growth factor--was partially purified from human fetal liver cells and characterized by its biological effects. Almost 70-fold protein content was purified with an approximately 80-fold increase in specific growth stimulator activity. Human hepatic stimulator substance proved to be heat-stable, protease-sensitive, organ-specific and species-nonspecific. Human hepatic stimulator substance produced a two- to threefold increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA when injected intraperitoneally into growing weanling mice (nonhepatectomized) or regenerating rats (34% hepatectomy). The effects of hHSS in reversing the lethality of D-galactosamine (1.6 gm/kg body weight)-induced hepatic necrosis in rats were further evaluated. A survival rate of 4% (n = 24), 41% (n = 12, p less than 0.05), 33% (n = 12, p less than 0.05), 31% (n = 13, p less than 0.05) and 18% (n = 11, p greater than 0.05) was observed when the rats were injected with 4 ml of saline intraperitoneally, 4 ml of human intact fetal hepatocytes (2.4 x 10(8] intraperitoneally, 4 ml of human hepatic stimulator substance intraperitoneally, 2 ml of twofold concentrated human hepatic stimulator substance intravenously and 1 ml of fourfold human hepatic stimulator substance intramuscularly, respectively, 20 hr after poisoning.",404,0
"The effect of age on treatment choice and survival in elderly breast cancer patients. To investigate the effect of age on treatment choice and survival in patients with breast cancer, data from the cancer registry of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) on 611 women have been analyzed. All patients 55 years and older admitted to the NKI for primary treatment of breast cancer between 1981 and 1986 were selected. For women 75 years and older, physicians were less likely to use treatment of adjuvant radiation therapy after a mastectomy and more often employed primary hormonal therapy only for local stage disease than for younger patients. Life-table analysis showed that disease-specific survival at 7 years for patients 65 through 74 years of age was significantly better (65%) than that of the youngest (55%) and the oldest age group (50%). In multivariate regression analysis (Cox), age older than 74 years was significantly and independently associated with a shorter disease-specific survival as compared with patients younger than 75 years. This difference in survival, however, does not seem to be the result of the difference in treatment between the age groups, but suggests an influence of age-related factors such as comorbid diseases and weak physical condition, which manifest themselves most strongly in the oldest age category and make the older woman more vulnerable to the course of malignant disease.",293,1
"Hepatic venoocclusive disease in autologous bone marrow transplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas. Retrospective review of 291 solid tumor and lymphoma patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed to determine the influence of pretransplant characteristics and preparative regimen to the development of hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD). Twelve patients (4.1%) developed a clinical syndrome of right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness or hepatomegaly, jaundice, and ascites, with or without encephalopathy, within 40 days of marrow reinfusion. Evidence of metastatic liver disease was the only pretransplant characteristic predictive for VOD (P = .0002). Sex, age, histology, hepatitis B serology, and elevated liver function tests were not predictive. No individual preparative agent had a significant effect on the development of VOD. However, a single 2-hour infusion of carmustine (BCNU) (greater than or equal to 450 mg/m2) led to an increased incidence of VOD when compared with the same dose administered in a fractionated schedule (P = .0258) when given with two other chemotherapeutic agents. Seven of eight autopsy specimens confirmed the clinical diagnosis of VOD. The four patients in whom clinical VOD resolved had lower median peak bilirubins (7.3 v 15.9 mg/dL), lower median peak creatinines (2.1 v 4.1 mg/dL), and relatively quick engraftment of neutrophils (mean, 18.7 days). One of the four patients in whom VOD resolved had other grade 4 (life-threatening) toxicities in contrast to eight of eight who succumbed. In summary, VOD is an uncommon complication in autotransplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas. Our data suggest caution in selecting patients with known metastatic liver disease and consideration of a fractionated BCNU schedule especially in combination with other alkylating agents.",404,1
"Dexamethasone inhibits the induction of monocyte chemotactic-activating factor production by IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor. Recently purified and molecularly cloned monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) may play a major role in recruiting and activating monocytes in the inflammatory process. We examined the effects of a potent anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone (DXS), on the production of this factor. Over a wide range of concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-8) M), DXS inhibited the production of MCAF at the mRNA and protein level in a human fibrosarcoma cell line, which was stimulated with either IL-1 or TNF-alpha. We examined the turn-over of synthesized MCAF mRNA that showed DXS decreased the stability of MCAF mRNA. Furthermore, the addition of actinomycin D and cycloheximide abolished this effect of DXS, indicating that de novo mRNA and protein synthesis were required for this process. In addition, a nuclear run-off analysis revealed that DXS also inhibited the transcription of IL-1- or TNF-activated MCAF genes. Therefore, both the destabilization of MCAF mRNA and the inhibition of transcription of the gene contribute to the decrease in the MCAF mRNA steady state level by DXS.",262,1
"Regulation of gene expression with double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. Alteration of gene transcription by inhibition of specific transcriptional regulatory proteins is necessary for determining how these factors participate in cellular differentiation. The functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods, each with specific limitations. Inhibition of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was achieved with double-stranded (ds) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained octamer or kappa B consensus sequences. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either octamer transcription factor or nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner. Octamer-dependent activation of a reporter plasmid or NF-kappa B-dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhancer was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a transiently transfected B cell line. Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer. The ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides probably compete for binding of specific transcription factors and may provide anti-viral, immunosuppressive, or other therapeutic effects.",267,1
"Local failure and related complications after definitive treatment of carcinoma of the prostate by irradiation or surgery. The authors review their institution's experience with the failure of definitive treatment to achieve local tumor control and with the distant dissemination and local morbidity associated with such failure. The causes of local failure are various: incomplete resection, implantation of spilled cells, and, possibly, selective implantation of circulating tumor cells in traumatized tissues after surgery and totally or partially resistant cells, new tumors, or radiologic misses after radiation. Treatment of local failure may be prophylactic or therapeutic and differs depending on the stage of the disease. Failure to control the tumor locally in the presence of distant metastases does not alter the length of survival, but it can profoundly affect the quality of survival. ",150,1
"Localization of basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA in melanocytic lesions by in situ hybridization. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a mitogen for normal human melanocytes and keratinocytes in culture. Experiments in vitro suggest that keratinocytes supply bFGF to melanocytes through a paracrine mechanism and that the aberrant expression of bFGF in melanomas confers growth independence from bFGF-producing cells. To determine whether bFGF is expressed in vivo, we examined a series of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions in situ using bFGF riboprobes on tissue sections, and correlated bFGF expression with histologic phenotype. Seventeen melanocytic neoplasms were studied, including four common acquired nevi, four dysplastic nevi, four primary malignant melanomas, and five metastatic melanomas. Nevic cells in benign intradermal nevi showed low signal intensity (1+), whereas compound and dysplastic nevi showed 2+ to 3+ expression in the junctional nevic cell population and 1+ expression in the dermal nevic cell population. Melanocytes in primary melanomas had intermediate (2+) and those in metastatic melanomas had low (1+) levels of bFGF gene transcripts. Fibroblasts expressed high levels (3+) and epidermal and adnexal keratinocytes moderate (2+) levels of bFGF in all cases studied. Basic FGF expression in endothelial cells, known to produce and respond to this growth factor in vitro, was lower than that in the fibroblast and keratinocyte cell population and, in 10 of 17 cases, no bFGF mRNA was detectable. This study shows that bFGF is expressed in nevomelanocytes in vivo in all melanocytic lesions studied and thus cannot be used as a marker for transformation. The presence of bFGF gene transcripts in the various dermal cell types and in keratinocytes suggests that it may act as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor in regulating cellular proliferation in the skin.",404,1
"Extrahepatic metabolism of morphine occurs in humans. The pharmacokinetics of morphine was studied in six patients in whom a radiologic localization of an insulinoma was to be performed under general anesthesia. Sampling was done in the peripheral artery, the mesenteric vein in five of the six patients, the hepatic vein, and the peripheral vein, as well as in urine. Hepatic blood flow was estimated by an indocyanine green infusion technique at the end of the radiologic procedure. Morphine terminal half-life was 92 +/- 9 minutes, total body clearance was 1260 ml.min-1, and the hepatic extraction ratio was 0.65 +/- 0.11. No concentration gradient was observed between the artery and the superior mesenteric vein, showing that no gut wall metabolism of morphine occurred. The total body clearance exceeded the hepatic clearance by 38%. It was concluded that the extrahepatic extraintestinal clearance of morphine probably occurred through the kidney.",202,1
"Muscle fibre type and habitual snoring. Although anatomical abnormalities of the upper airway have been recorded in some patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a muscle tone dysregulation also seems to have an important role in this disorder. Since habitual snoring is the initial stage of OSA, the structural characteristics of upper airway muscles (medium pharyngeal constrictor muscle [MPCM]) from 13 men (9 non-snorers and 4 habitual snorers) were studied. MPCM fibre structure in non-snorers was broadly similar to that in normal limb muscles, with the exception that fibre diameters were smaller for all fibre types. Compared with limb muscles, MPCM had a smaller proportion of type IIb fibres and a higher proportion of types I and IIa fibres. MPCM in habitual snorers had an abnormal distribution of fibre types (low percentage of type I and type IIb fibres and high percentage of type IIa fibres) compared with non-snorers (p less than 0.001) and the type IIa fibres were hypertrophic. No myopathic or neurogenic changes were seen. Two possible hypotheses explain the abnormal distribution of fibre types in snorers. First, a constitutionally determined reduction of slow alpha-motor neurons induces an adaptive transformation of type IIb to type IIa fibres and a hypertrophy of type IIa fibres; or, second, motor neurons change their patterns of discharge and, hence, of activation, and modify fibre-type distribution of MPCM as an adaptation to the anatomical characteristic of upper airway and habitual snoring.",322,1
"A case-control study of Alzheimer's disease in Australia. We conducted a case-control study of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) on 170 cases aged 52 to 96 years, and 170 controls matched for age, sex and, where possible, the general practice of origin. Trained lay interviewers naive to the hypotheses and to the clinical status of the elderly person carried out risk-factor interviews with informants. Significant odds ratios were found for 4 variables: a history of either dementia, probable AD, or Down's syndrome in a 1st-degree relative, and underactivity as a behavioral trait in both the recent and more distant past. Previously reported or suggested associations not confirmed by this study include head injury, starvation, thyroid disease, analgesic abuse, antacid use (aluminum exposure), alcohol abuse, smoking, and being left-handed.",183,0
"Reperfusion and readmission of oxygen. Pathophysiological relevance of oxygen-derived free radicals to arrhythmogenesis. We have examined the pathophysiological role of readmission of oxygen (and hence production of oxygen-derived free radicals) in the initiation of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias by separating, on a temporal basis, readmission flow from readmission of oxygen. Isolated rat hearts (n = 12/group) were subjected to 10 minutes of regional ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion. In controls reperfused with oxygenated solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg), 92% of hearts developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the first 20 seconds of reperfusion, whereas in hearts reperfused with hypoxic solution (Po2 9.3-12.2 mm Hg), the incidence of VF was only 17% (p less than 0.05). Subsequent readmission of control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) to the latter group led, within 20 seconds, to the appearance of VF in seven of the 10 hearts (70%) that had not previously fibrillated. To examine whether hypoxic reperfusion had prevented VF or merely delayed its onset, the studies were repeated in separate groups of hearts with the duration of hypoxic reperfusion extended to 5 minutes. In addition, to examine the partial pressure dependence of the relation, the Po2 in the reperfusion solution was set at one of five different levels: greater than 600, 150-192.7, 69-85.6, 9.2-14.8, or 0.0 mm Hg. It was found that hypoxia merely delayed VF onset by 20-40 seconds and did not significantly reduce the incidence of VF, which was 83%, 92%, 67%, 58%, and 58%, respectively. This indicated that readmission of oxygen is unnecessary for the initiation of VF during reperfusion. The hearts that reverted to sinus rhythm during the ensuing 5 minutes (n = 8, 4, 5, 9, and 8, respectively) were used to assess the arrhythmogenic consequences of readmission of oxygen. When control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) was readmitted, new episodes of VF were elicited within 20 seconds in a manner that was inversely proportional to the preceding Po2 (p less than 0.05), the incidence of new episodes of VF being 0%, 0%, 40%, 67%, and 86%, respectively. The arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was not the result of a sudden increase in heart rate, because a similar arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was seen in separate groups of hearts that were paced (350 beats/min) throughout hypoxia and readmission of oxygen. In conclusion, readmission of flow and readmission of oxygen are independent determinants of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",656,0
"Neonatal small bowel atresia, stenosis and segmental dilatation. In 8 years, 44 neonates were treated for small bowel atresia, stenosis or segmental dilatation by one surgical team. There was a single lesion in 30 infants and 14 had two or more sites of intestinal obstruction. Associated gastrointestinal abnormalities were found in 23 (52 per cent) patients. Resection of the atresia(s) and primary anastomosis were performed in 34 infants and staged procedures were carried out in ten patients with complicated lesions. Patients undergoing staged procedures had a higher complication rate than those having primary repair (six out of ten and 11 out of 34 respectively). The overall initial survival rate was 93 per cent, rising to 100 per cent in those without associated anomalies or prenatal complications, but more than a quarter (27 per cent) of survivors have long-term disabilities.",194,0
"Prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 mediate reduction of increased mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass by aspiration of shed pulmonary venous blood. Increased mean arterial pressure during the aortic crossclamp period while on cardiopulmonary bypass was usually treated by us with hypotensive drugs. We noticed, however, that aspirating shed excess pulmonary venous blood from the open pleural cavities causes an immediate reduction in mean arterial pressure, obviating the need for any further pharmaceutical intervention. In this study we investigated the relationship between the reduction in mean arterial pressure and the levels of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 in the peripheral and pulmonary venous blood. Ten men undergoing coronary bypass operations had 21 episodes of increased mean arterial pressure (106.9 +/- 11.4 mm Hg) during aortic crossclamping, which was reduced to 67.4 +/- 11.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) only by aspirating a mean of 490 ml (range 150 to 1100 ml) of pulmonary venous blood from the pleurae back into the circulation. Mean peripheral prostacyclin level, measured as 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and prostaglandin E2 level, both measured by radioimmunoassay technique, were significantly lower at peak mean arterial pressure (419 +/- 180 and 59.5 +/- 21.2 pg/ml) than at lowest mean arterial pressure (632 +/- 271 and 96.7 +/- 52.4 pg/ml for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2, respectively; p less than 0.001). Prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2 levels in the aspirated pulmonary venous blood were 2309 +/- 3098 pg/ml and 749 +/- 909 pg/ml, respectively. The hypotensive effect of shed pulmonary venous blood that is aspirated back from the pleurae into the circulation seems to be mediated by the high levels of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2, both powerful vasodilators.",456,0
"Prognostic importance of delayed Q-wave evolution 3 to 24 hours after initiation of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The timing of Q-wave evolution and its prognostic significance was studied in 201 patients who received thrombolytic therapy for a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). One hundred forty-one patients (70%) had evidence of a Q-wave AMI within 3 hours of the initiation of thrombolytic therapy, 31 (16%) developed Q waves after 3 hours but before hospital discharge, and 29 (14%) were discharged with a non-Q-wave AMI. Laboratory indicators of myocardial damage and in-hospital morbidity and mortality were greater among patients with Q-wave AMIs than with non-Q-wave AMIs. When these indexes were examined with respect to the timing of Q-wave evolution, the prognosis of patients with delayed Q-wave development was similar to that of patients with non-Q-wave AMIs. Thus, compared to patients with early (less than or equal to 3 hours) Q-wave evolution, patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI had a smaller creatine kinase peak (mean 661 to 1,081 vs 1,251 to 1,541 IU; p = 0.005), better preservation of left ventricular function as measured by radionuclide ventriculography before discharge (mean +/- standard deviation 54 +/- 11% vs 47 +/- 13%; p less than 0.01), and a lower incidence of congestive heart failure at discharge (3 vs 15%; p = 0.02). In-hospital mortality was lower among patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI (5 of 141 vs 0 of 60; difference not significant).",400,0
"Decreased mortality in users of estrogen replacement therapy In a prospective study of 8881 postmenopausal female residents of a retirement community in southern California, we evaluated in detail the relationship between estrogen use and overall mortality. After 7 1/2 years of follow-up, there had been 1447 deaths. Women with a history of estrogen use had 20% lower age-adjusted, all-cause mortality than lifetime nonusers (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.87). Mortality decreased with increasing duration of use and was lower among current users than among women who used estrogens only in the distant past. Current users with more than 15 years of estrogen use had a 40% reduction in their overall mortality. Among oral estrogen users, relative risks of death could not be distinguished by specific dosages of the oral estrogen taken for the longest time. Women who had used estrogen replacement therapy had a reduced mortality from all categories of acute and chronic arteriosclerotic disease and cerebrovascular disease. This group of women had a reduced mortality from cancer, although this reduction was not statistically significant. The mortality from all remaining causes combined was the same in estrogen users and lifetime nonusers.",253,1

"Limitations of electroencephalographic monitoring in the detection of cerebral ischemia accompanying carotid endarterectomy. An analysis was undertaken of 458 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed over 6 years with the patient under general anesthesia and with electroencephalographic monitoring. Seventy patients (15%) had electroencephalographic changes suggestive of ischemia with carotid clamping and had shunts placed. Ischemic encephalographic changes occurred in 26% of patients with an occluded contralateral carotid artery, 21% of patients with a prior stroke history, and 12% of patients with no stroke history and a patent contralateral carotid artery. Nineteen strokes (4.1%), nine transient deficits (2.0%), and one death (0.2%) occurred in the 458 endarterectomies in this experience. Ten of the 19 strokes and five of nine transient deficits were immediately apparent when patients awoke from anesthesia. Five of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all five patients with immediate transient deficits had no ischemic electroencephalographic changes during the procedure. Two other patients with immediate strokes initially had ischemic electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping that reversed with increased blood pressure or shunting. Therefore 7 of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all 5 patients with immediate transient deficits had electroencephalographs unchanged from baseline at completion of the procedure, and thus deficits not manifest by operative electroencephalographic changes developed. Our data do not support the tenet that electroencephalographic monitoring will always predict neurologic deficits accompanying carotid endarterectomy.",314,0
"The significance of gastrinomas found in peripancreatic lymph nodes. A patient with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) was found to have a solitary, extrapancreatic, extraintestinal gastrinoma in a peripancreatic lymph node. Preoperative studies did not show the location of the tumor. After excision of the gastrinoma the patient's fasting serum gastrin level dropped from preoperative levels of 596 pg/ml to 120 pg/ml (normal, less than 200 pg/ml). Fasting and stimulated gastrin levels have remained within the normal range at 18 months follow-up. This patient had previously undergone antrectomy, so it could not be determined if this tumor represented a primary lymph node gastrinoma or metastasis from an unrecognized tumor that may have been present in the resected stomach or duodenum. The outcome of this case confirms the previous reports that ZES can be controlled after resection of gastrinomas that were contained within abdominal lymph nodes, even if a primary enteropancreatic tumor is not found. Our results also support the use of an aggressive operative search aimed at eradication of the tumor in patients with ZES even if preoperative localization studies fail to identify the site of the gastrinoma.",259,0
"Distinguishable types of dyspnea in patients with shortness of breath. Dyspnea frequently accompanies a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Although dyspnea is often considered a single sensation, alternatively it may encompass multiple sensations that are not well explained by a single physiologic mechanism. To investigate whether breathlessness experienced by patients represents more than one sensation, we studied 53 patients with one of the following seven conditions: pulmonary vascular disease, neuromuscular and chest wall disease, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, interstitial lung disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients were asked to choose descriptions of their sensation(s) of breathlessness from a dyspnea questionnaire listing 19 descriptors. Cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings among the chosen descriptors. We found that patients could distinguish different sensations of breathlessness. In addition, we found an association between certain groups of descriptors and specific conditions producing dyspnea. These findings concur with those in an earlier study in normal volunteers in whom dyspnea was induced by various stimuli. We conclude that different types of dyspnea exist in patients with a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Furthermore, different mechanisms may mediate these various sensations.",231,0
"Diagnosis of Lyme disease based on dermatologic manifestations. Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is an infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is most commonly transmitted to humans by a tick bite. Characterized by early and late phases, Lyme disease is a multisystem illness involving the skin, heart, joints, and nervous system. Diagnosis is based predominantly on clinical manifestations, the most specific being dermatologic. Thus, recognizing the dermatologic manifestations of Lyme disease is important for diagnosis and institution of appropriate, effective therapy. Approximately 75% of patients with Lyme disease present with the pathognomonic skin lesion erythema migrans, an expanding erythematous lesion. During early infection, secondary erythema migrans lesions or Borrelia lymphocytoma may occur. Borrelia lymphocytoma commonly presents as an erythematous nodule on the ear lobe or nipple. During late infection, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, an erythematous, atrophic plaque unique to Lyme disease may appear; it has been described in about 10% of patients with Lyme disease in Europe. Fibrotic nodules associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans as well as other sclerotic and atrophic lesions, such as morphea, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, anetoderma, and atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini, have been seen late in the course of Lyme disease. In a few cases, other sclerodermatous lesions, such as eosinophilic fasciitis and progressive facial hemiatrophy, have been linked to B. burgdorferi infection. We review the cutaneous lesions associated with Lyme disease.",343,0
"Long-term morphology of spastic or flaccid muscles in spinal cord-transected rabbits. Despite difficulty in long-term maintenance of spinalized rabbits, muscular pathologic changes in chronic spinalized rabbits could be observed for a period of four weeks. Rabbits were prepared by spinal cord transection at T10 (spastic paralysis) or by spinal cord removal below L7 (flaccid paralysis). Spastic preparations showed hind-limb spasticity and reflex incontinence one to two days after operation. Hypertrophic fibers began to appear in spastic muscles after two weeks. This hypertrophy, thought to be caused by phasic repetitive contraction, was verified by electron microscopy to be different from normal exercise hypertrophy. Flaccid preparations maintained hind-limb flaccidity and overflow incontinence. In flaccid muscle, marked muscle fiber necrosis indicated rapid atrophy. Spinal deformity and joint contracture inactivate spinalized rabbits, and cause pressure sores. However, feeding assistance and avoidance of complications make long-term maintenance possible.",204,0
"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia associated with profound lymphopenia and abnormal T-lymphocyte subset ratios during treatment for early-stage breast carcinoma. Two women with Stage II breast carcinoma treated with lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Neither woman had evidence of immunosuppression before therapy. They both had profound lymphopenia, reversed CD4/CD8 ratios, and normal peripheral blood total leukocyte counts at the time of their infections. Both women were seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and had no risk factors for such an infection. The patients' CD4 lymphocyte counts increased after chemotherapy for breast carcinoma was discontinued. Thus, it appears that the therapy they received may have caused severe T-lymphocyte mediated immunosuppression.",163,1
"Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing. Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia. Body schema disturbances were studied in a 62-yr-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge.",333,0
"Fertility after contraception or abortion. There is a very small correlation, if any, between the prior use of OCs and congenital malformations, including Down's syndrome. There are few, if any, recent reports on masculinization of a female fetus born to a mother who took an OC containing 1 mg of a progestogen during early pregnancy. However, patients suspected of being pregnant and who are desirous of continuing that pregnancy should not continue to take OCs, nor should progestogen withdrawal pregnancy tests be used. Concern still exists regarding the occurrence of congenital abnormalities in babies born to such women. The incidence of postoperative infection after first trimester therapeutic abortion in this country is low. However, increasing numbers of women are undergoing repeated pregnancy terminations, and their risk for subsequent pelvic infections may be multiplied with each succeeding abortion. The incidence of prematurity due to cervical incompetence or surgical infertility after first trimester pregnancy terminations is not increased significantly. Asherman's syndrome may occur after septic therapeutic abortion. The pregnancy rate after treatment of this syndrome is low. The return of menses and the achievement of a pregnancy may be slightly delayed after OCs are discontinued, but the fertility rate is within the normal range by 1 year. The incidence of postpill amenorrhea of greater than 6 months' duration is probably less than 1%. The occurrence of the syndrome does not seem to be related to length of use or type of pill. Patients with prior normal menses as well as those with menstrual abnormalities before use of OCs may develop this syndrome. Patients with normal estrogen and gonadotropin levels usually respond with return of menses and ovulation when treated with clomiphene. The rate for achievement of pregnancy is much lower than that for patients with spontaneous return of menses. The criteria for defining PID or for categorizing its severity are diverse. The incidence of PID is higher among IUD users than among patients taking OCs or using a barrier method. The excess risk of PID among IUD users, with the exception of the first few months after insertion, is related to sexually transmitted diseases and not the IUD. Women with no risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases have little increased risk of PID or infertility associated with IUD use. There appears to be no increased risk of congenital anomalies, altered sex ratio, or early pregnancy loss among spermicide users. All present methods of contraception entail some risk to the patient. The risk of imparied future fertility with the use of any method appears to be low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",516,0
"Relationship between histologic features, DNA flow cytometry, and clinical behavior of squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content was done on 133 primary squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Overall, 76 tumors (57.1%) were not diploid (aneuploid or tetraploid). The DNA index (DI) was calculated and grouped into three levels. Fifty-seven cases had a DI in a range of 1.85 to 2.15 (44 diploid and 13 tetraploid). The cases were grouped in relation to ploidy, proliferative index, and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. Every group was analyzed with respect to survival rate. Ploidy was related to histocytologic grade. In well-differentiated tumors (G1) survival rates at 48 months were 41.7% in diploid cases and 27.7% in nondiploid ones (relative risk [RR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89, 4.52). In NO cases that underwent surgery, survival rates at 48 months were, respectively, 81.8% and 49.2% (RR, 5.07; 95% CI, 0.76, 33.93). These results suggest that ploidy may be a new independent parameter of prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. This is useful in clinical practice because it allows the clinician to recognize those cases with poorer prognosis among the early tumors at a stage where other prognostic parameters are not yet available.",354,0
"Intraocular pressure and the rate of visual field loss in chronic open-angle glaucoma. We measured the rate of change of visual field threshold values over time (mean follow-up, 44.9 +/- 17.4 months) by trend analysis in 40 eyes of 40 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. Twenty-eight eyes had stable visual fields, and two eyes had significant visual field improvement. Ten eyes had significant visual field deterioration and showed a correlation between indices of intraocular pressure (standard error of the mean, P = .02; standard deviation, P = .04; and range, P = .05) and the rate of visual field loss in the superonasal region of the visual field, such that the greater the variation of intraocular pressure the greater the rate of loss. The group losing visual fields had a higher mean visual field threshold value and significantly less optic disk pallor and cupping at the start of the study than the stable visual field group. Thus, a significant rate of visual field loss occurred at an earlier stage of the disease and showed a correlation with intraocular pressure in this stage.",236,0
"The relationship of nasopharyngeal carcinomas and second independent malignancies based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group experience. The authors sought to learn if the incidence of second independent malignancies after the irradiation of carcinomas of the nasopharynx is similar to that observed after treatment of tumors arising in other head and neck sites. One hundred twenty-one patients who had primary carcinomas of the nasopharynx who were treated solely by ionizing radiation (according to the specifications of a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol) were identified and their subsequent well-being was reviewed. Overall there was a 4.1% incidence of second malignancies (2% after 3 years, 5% after 5 years, and 8% after 8 years) with most arising in the upper aerodigestive tract. This rate is significantly less than the rate associated with other head and neck sites. It is not significantly different from the rate of first malignancies observed in an age-matched and sex-matched population. When only those patients who were free of all evidence of neoplastic disease 6 months after the completion of radiotherapy are considered, similar analysis leads to similar outcomes. The authors conclude that the risk of second malignancies after the successful irradiation of carcinomas of the nasopharynx is substantially less than after treatment of tumors at other head and neck sites.",270,1
"Survival in patients with large-bowel cancer. A population-based investigation from the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. Five-year survival data were obtained in 97 percent or 1105 of 1140 new patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma during a 12-month period in 1981 and 1982, as part of a large comprehensive population-based study of colorectal cancer incidence, etiology, and survival, The Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. Fifteen percent of patients were Dukes' A stage, 32 percent were Dukes' B, 25 percent were Dukes' C, and 29 percent were Dukes' D. At five years after diagnosis, the observed survival rate was 36 percent and the adjusted rate was 42 percent. Dukes' staging was a highly discriminating factor in survival (P less than 0.001). Survival rates were better in women than in men and better for patients with colon cancer than for patients with rectal cancer. Survival by Dukes' staging was not affected by colon subsite or by the tumor being the first and single tumor, metachronous tumor, or synchronous tumor. The survival of younger patients was better for Dukes' stages A, B, and C, and worse for Dukes' D. Survival was worse in the presence of bowel perforation in Dukes' C and D stages. Within Dukes' D (incurable cases), survival was best in the absence of hepatic metastases, slightly worse when only hepatic metastases were present, and poorest in the presence of both hepatic and extrahepatic metastases. Statistical modeling of survival determinants other than staging indicated that cell differentiation had the largest effect (survival decreasing with poor cell differentiation), followed by site (survival worse for rectal cancer than colon cancer), then age (survival better for younger patients), while bowel perforation had the smallest effect on survival.",384,1
"Estrogen receptor level determines sex-specific in vitro transcription from the Xenopus vitellogenin promoter. Female-specific expression of the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin gene was reconstituted in vitro by addition of recombinant vaccinia-virus-produced estrogen receptor to nuclear extracts from male livers, in which this gene is silent. Transcription enhancement was at least 30 times and was selectively restricted to vitellogenin templates containing the estrogen-responsive unit. Thus, in male hepatocytes, estrogen receptor is the limiting regulatory factor that in the female liver controls efficient and accurate sex-specific expression of the vitellogenin gene. Furthermore, the Xenopus liver factor B, which is essential in addition to the estrogen receptor for the activation of this gene, was successfully replaced in the Xenopus extract by purified human nuclear factor I, identifying factor B of Xenopus as a functional homolog of this well-characterized human transcription factor.",189,0
"Combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy in advanced inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The final report of a randomized trial. Between 1983 and 1986, the National Institute for Cancer Research in Genoa and affiliated institutions conducted a randomized study to compare two different ways of combining chemotherapy (CT) and radiation therapy (RT). One hundred sixteen patients were randomized to receive neoadjuvant CT followed by definitive RT (treatment arm A) or alternating CT and RT. In treatment arm A, RT consisted of 70 Gy to the involved areas and 50 Gy to the uninvolved neck at 2 Gy/fraction, five fractions per week. In treatment arm B, RT consisted of 60 Gy to involved areas and 50 Gy to the uninvolved neck in three courses of 20 Gy each, 2 Gy/fraction, ten fractions/2 weeks alternated with four courses of CT. CT consisted of vinblastine 6 mg/m2 intravenously followed 6 hours later by bleomycin 30 IU intramuscularly, day 1; methotrexate 200 mg intravenously, day 2; leucovorin rescue, day 3. CT was repeated every 2 weeks up to four courses. The same CT was used in both treatment arms of the study. Fifty-five patients were entered in treatment arm A and 61 in treatment arm B. Complete responses were 7/48 and 19/57 in treatment arms A and B, respectively (P less than 0.03). Four-year progression-free survival was 4% in treatment arm A and 12% in treatment arm B (P less than 0.02), and four-year survival was 10% in A and 22% in B (P less than 0.02). Mucosal tolerance was significantly worse in treatment arm B (P less than 0.00004).

"Genetic determination of cytomegalovirus-induced and age-related cardiopathy in inbred mice. Characterization of infiltrating cells. Carditis developed 7 days after the administration of murine cytomegalovirus to neonatal, young adult or aged mice of varying sensitivity to lethal infection with this virus. The inflammation persisted for up to 80 days, but infected myocardial cells were rare and were not seen after day 10. The inflammatory cells comprised macrophages (up to 30%) and T cells (up to 80%), with a high ratio of Lyt2+ to L3T4+ cells throughout. Although the H-2 genotype affects murine cytomegalovirus replication at the level of individual cells, and hence resistance to lethal infection, it did not determine resistance to cardiopathy per se. However BALB/c, BALB.B, and BALB.K mice developed persistent myocarditis regardless of age at infection, and age-related cardiopathy was frequent and severe in infected and uninfected mice. B10 and B10.BR mice also developed myocarditis after neonatal infection, but inflammation resolved rapidly after adult infection and age-related cardiopathy was correspondingly mild. C3H mice exhibited minimal carditis after neonatal or adult infection. However neonatal infection appears to accelerate age-related cardiopathy, which is severe in retired breeders of this strain.",280,0
"A prospective study of double diagnosis of nonpalpable lesions of the breast. Approximately three-fourths of open biopsies of the breast performed for mammographically detected suspicious lesions are shown histologically to be benign. Under the narrow conditions described herein, stereotaxic fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can identify these lesions with an accuracy of more than 90 per cent and a false-negative rate of 5 per cent. In an effort to reduce this failure rate, the mammographic appearance and stereotaxic FNA results of these lesions each were given scores on a scale of zero (benign) to five (malignant), to derive an over-all risk score prospectively applied to 264 suspicious occult lesions of the breast prior to open, biopsy. While all 264 lesions could be assigned a mammographic score, adequate tissue for assignment of a cytologic score could be obtained from 150 lesions. Of the 150 evaluable lesions, 53 were malignant and 97 were benign, historically. With a total score of two as the threshold for open biopsy, 21 of 150 (14 per cent) were proved to be benign, with no false-negative findings. If the total threshold score mandating an open biopsy was raised to four, the comparable figures were 61 of 150 (40 per cent) benign lesions and two false-negative instances of carcinoma in situ. Provided adequate tissue is aspirated for cytologic examination, we conclude that this algorithm has practical value in the management of nonpalpable lesions of the breast in that it can reliably identify a fraction of the benign lesions and spare these patients an operation.",350,1
"Extrahepatic metabolism of morphine occurs in humans. The pharmacokinetics of morphine was studied in six patients in whom a radiologic localization of an insulinoma was to be performed under general anesthesia. Sampling was done in the peripheral artery, the mesenteric vein in five of the six patients, the hepatic vein, and the peripheral vein, as well as in urine. Hepatic blood flow was estimated by an indocyanine green infusion technique at the end of the radiologic procedure. Morphine terminal half-life was 92 +/- 9 minutes, total body clearance was 1260 ml.min-1, and the hepatic extraction ratio was 0.65 +/- 0.11. No concentration gradient was observed between the artery and the superior mesenteric vein, showing that no gut wall metabolism of morphine occurred. The total body clearance exceeded the hepatic clearance by 38%. It was concluded that the extrahepatic extraintestinal clearance of morphine probably occurred through the kidney.",202,1
"Hydrocephalus: overdrainage by ventricular shunts. A review and recommendations. Selected literature review of the clinical course of patients with ventricular shunts for hydrocephalus shows that the effects of cerebrospinal fluid overdrainage are subdural hematoma, craniosynostosis, slit ventricle syndrome, and low intracranial pressure syndrome. These occur sequentially at different age groups, but approximate averages of incidence and time of occurrence after first shunt reveal an overall incidence of 10%-12% for at least one of these appearing at 6.5 years after shunting. The basic etiology, diagnosis, and variety of treatment modalities available are reviewed, including the need for shunt closing intracranial pressure control. Included is a hydrocephalus program designed to minimize the need for long-term extracranial shunts and to maximize therapeutic intracranial procedures for hydrocephalus.",169,0
"Impact of the availability of a prior electrocardiogram on the triage of the patient with acute chest pain STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether information from a prior electrocardiogram (ECG) improves diagnostic accuracy in the emergency department (ED) evaluation of patients with acute chest pain. DESIGN: Analysis of prospectively collected data from a cohort study. SETTING: Emergency departments of four community and three university hospitals. PATIENTS: 5,673 patients aged greater than or equal to 30 years who presented to the EDs of participating hospitals for evaluation of acute chest pain, including 772 (14%) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After adjusting for clinical characteristics, no significant difference was found in the sensitivities of admission to the hospital or to the coronary care unit (CCU) between AMI patients with and without prior ECGs available for review. However, non-AMI patients with prior ECGs available for review were more likely to avoid CCU admission than were non-AMI patients without prior ECGs. This improvement in specificity was most marked in the 2,024 patients whose current ED ECGs had changes consistent with ischemia or infarction: when a prior ECG was available, non-AMI patients were more than twice as likely to be discharged (26% vs. 12%) and about 1.5 times as likely to avoid CCU admission (39% vs. 27%) (both p less than 0.0001). Admission rates of AMI patients with and without prior ECGs were similar. CONCLUSION: When the current ECG is consistent with ischemia or infarction, the availability of a prior ECG for comparison to determine whether the ECG changes are old or new improves diagnostic accuracy and triage decisions by reducing the admission of patients without AMI or acute ischemic heart disease (increased specificity) without reducing the admission of patients with these diagnoses (unchanged sensitivity).",387,0
"Sleep apnoea syndrome associated with maxillofacial abnormalities. Four cases with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) are presented. They consisted of two cases with TMJ ankylosis with micrognathia, one case with Treacher Collins Syndrome, and one case with the Long Face Syndrome. Standard and specific cephalometric parameters were obtained to detect the site of the obstruction. Polysomnographic studies yielded information regarding the patient's sleep-wake state, respiratory and cardiac functioning, pre- and post-operatively. A temporary tracheostomy corrected the symptoms in one patient but the syndrome recurred when it was closed. Surgical correction of the maxillofacial anomalies will re-establish normal sleep patterns preventing OSAS. ",152,0
"Chiari pelvic osteotomy for osteoarthritis. The influence of the torn and detached acetabular labrum. We assessed the results of Chiari pelvic osteotomy in 64 hips with early osteoarthritis in terms of acetabular labral detachment detected pre-operatively by arthrography. At an average follow-up of four years, assessment by the Merle d'Aubigne score showed 83% excellent or good results. These satisfactory results were achieved in only half the cases with a detached labrum, but in nearly all cases with normal or torn acetabular labra. Other factors such as the acetabular index, the level and angle of osteotomy, and the displacement following osteotomy did not affect the results. Chiari pelvic osteotomy is a worthwhile procedure for early osteoarthritis in selected cases, but a detached acetabular labrum increases the risk of clinical failure.",174,0
"Left ventricular end-systolic stress-volume index ratio in aortic and mitral regurgitation with normal ejection fraction. To evaluate the left ventricular contractile state in regurgitant valvular disease with normal ejection fraction, we analyzed the end-systolic stress-volume index relationship (ESSVR) by means of cineangiography in 15 normal subjects, 11 patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), and 10 patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) whose ejection fraction (EF) was 60% or more. The end-systolic stress-volume index ratio in normal subjects was 5.57 +/- 0.60 kdyne/cm5/m2 (mean +/- standard deviation), and we defined the range including +/- 2 standard deviations of the ratio as the normal ESSVR range. Six patients with AR and five patients with MR placed inside the normal ESSVR range, termed AR IN and MR IN, but the remaining five patients with AR and MR placed to the right of the normal range, termed AR OUT and MR OUT. EF did not differ between patients with AR IN and AR OUT (69.4 +/- 5.4 verus 70.7 +/- 6.1%) and between MR IN and MR OUT (71.6 +/- 3.6 versus 71.1 +/- 7.9%). The EF of the subdivided groups with AR and MR also did not differ from that of normal subjects (70.7 +/- 7.3%). This finding showed that the left ventricular contractile state was depressed in patients with AR OUT and MR OUT despite a normal EF. In AR and MR the end-systolic stress and end-systolic volume index of OUT did not differ from those of IN, but the end-diastolic volume index of OUT was larger than that of IN (AR OUT 156.8 +/- 27.9 versus AR IN 110.8 +/- 24.1 ml/m2, MR OUT 160.5 +/- 44.7 versus MR IN 101.0 +/ 16.6 ml/m2; both p less than 0.05), and the regurgitant fraction of OUT was higher than that of IN (AR OUT 52.6 +/- 13.6 versus AR IN 29.7 +/- 13.3%, MR OUT 52.9 +/- 10.2 versus MR IN 30.2 +/- 11.4%; both p less than 0.05). In addition, there was a linear inverse correlation between the end-systolic stress-volume index ratio and the end-diastolic volume index in all subjects (r = -0.82, n = 36). In normal subjects there was a linear inverse correlation between end-systolic stress and the EF (r = -0.91, n = 15), but this relationship failed to separate patients with OUT from those with IN. Results of the present study suggest that some patients with AR and MR whose EF was normal had a depressed contractile state, and these patients had a large end-diastolic volume index and a high regurgitant fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",690,0
"Penetrating aortic ulcers: diagnosis with MR imaging. The authors studied seven patients with penetrating aortic ulcers with use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. All patients were evaluated for acute chest symptoms, and the presence of aortic ulcers was confirmed by means of angiography in all seven patients. Five patients also underwent computed tomography (CT). Three patients underwent surgical repair of the thoracic aorta. MR findings included intramural hematoma and focal aortic wall ulceration in four patients, focal ulceration in one, focal intramural hematoma in one, and focal intramural hematoma with rupture in one. The diagnosis of intramural hematoma was made by the detection of increased signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MR images. MR imaging was superior to angiography in depicting the extent of intramural thrombus, although one ulceration diagnosed at angiography was missed at MR imaging. MR imaging was superior to CT in differentiating acute intramural hematoma from atherosclerotic plaque and chronic intraluminal thrombus, although it did not depict displaced intimal calcification in one patient with extensive intramural hematoma.",223,0
"Forces of change in the health care system. Implications for cancer care in the 1990s. Dramatic changes will occur in the health care system during the 1990s which will profoundly affect the delivery of care for cancer. Perhaps the most important factor is the aging of the population. As the proportion of people who achieve old age increases, the absolute prevalence and incidence of cancer will increase despite improved treatment techniques. This phenomenon will increase health care expenditures despite ongoing efforts to control costs. Second, there will be continuing efforts at cost control and increased emphasis on quality assurance and outcomes by third party payers. Providers will be scrutinized and compared with one another. The large payers of the nation's health care bills will demand proof of outcome and cost leading to bidding by providers and payment only to those who have the best outcome for the least money. Third, there will be an increasing emphasis on prevention and screening, in public health policy, an approach that may conflict with personal freedom. Fourth, there will be increasing deliberations and questions about the ethics of the health care system and treatment decisions. There will be continuing debate about the need for a rationing of health care and the right of individual privacy versus the states' right to preserve life. These changes will impact on all health care professionals whose practice includes patients with cancer.",267,1
"Melanoma in pregnancy. The clinical course of malignant melanoma in pregnancy has been a subject of controversy, but current evidence indicates that it is similar to the clinical course in non-pregnant patients. Early detection and biopsy of localized disease is crucial because early treatment provides an excellent prognosis. Surgical excision is the primary therapy for this disease. As the primary care provider for many women in the reproductive age group, obstetrician-gynecologists have an opportunity to detect these lesions at their earliest stages when they are amenable to cure. Overall, maternal metastases to the fetus and placenta are very rare events and do not warrant elective termination based on the maternal diagnosis. However, a thorough examination of the infant and placenta should be done in all cases of melanoma complicating pregnancy. After treatment, long-term follow-up is recommended. Since most recurrences develop within 3 years after the diagnosis, it remains prudent to recommend that these patients avoid a subsequent pregnancy during this interval.",195,1
"The elusive colonic malignancy. A need for definitive preoperative localization. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the standard of practice for the diagnosis of colonic malignancies. Unfortunately, the inability of endoscopy to obtain precise distance measurements from the anal verge can make localization of lesions at operation difficult. For this reason, preoperative barium enema or intraoperative colonoscopy have been advocated to further pinpoint the sites of those lesions not thought to be easily located at operation. Five patients are presented in whom malignant lesions of the colon were diagnosed and verified histologically, but were later undetectable at operation or subsequent colonoscopic examinations. Four of these patients underwent laparotomy and three received colon resections. None of these patients' tumors were identified during intraoperative colonoscopy, in the resected bowel on pathologic examination, or on follow-up colonoscopy. A fifth patient is presented who spontaneously passed a polyp containing invasive adenocarcinoma, but multiple colonoscopic examinations have failed to identify the site of the lesion. To date, none of these tumors have recurred with periods of follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years. These patients demonstrate a poorly documented and little understood aspect of the behavior of colonic malignancies, i.e., the ability to spontaneously regress or slough from the bowel wall. Based on these instances, localization of potentially malignant colon lesions is recommended with submucosal dye injections at initial endoscopy or with colonoscopy in the operating room immediately prior to operation.",294,1
"Role of nasal allergy in chronic maxillary sinusitis--diagnostic value of nasal challenge with allergen. The role of nasal allergy in chronic maxillary sinusitis without an air-fluid level was studied in 37 patients. Seventy-three nasal provocation tests with various inhalant allergens were performed in 37 patients by means of rhinomanometry, and maxillary sinus radiographs were performed before and repeatedly after the allergen challenge. Forty-one positive nasal responses (NRs) occurred in 29 patients; 13 were immediate only, 18 were late only, and 10 NRs were dual responses. Of these responses, 32 demonstrated radiographic changes, primarily an increase in mucosal edema and/or opacification. These responses were accompanied by increased pressure in the maxillary sinuses, acute headache, and sometimes otalgia. Eight patients did not develop any NRs; however, increased thickening of the mucosal membrane of the maxillary sinuses, accompanied by subjective symptoms, was recorded in three of these nonresponders. These results demonstrate the role of nasal allergy in some patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis, which may affect the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this disorder.",236,0
"Pathologic characteristics of human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-related extranodal orofacial lymphomas. Eleven cases of extranodal orofacial lymphomas (EOFL), consisting of four HTLV-related and seven HTLV-unrelated EOFL, were investigated with respect to the immunohistochemical and clinical features. HTLV-related EOFL were of T-cell phenotype and were associated with a poorer prognosis than HTLV-unrelated EOFL, most of which were of B-cell origin. The appearance of giant cells with cerebriform nuclei was helpful in identifying HTLV-related EOFL. The relatively high incidence of T-cell type EOFL in our series was considered to be related to the high percentage of HTLV carriers in our district, an area endemic for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma.

"Effects of changes in level and pattern of breathing on the sensation of dyspnea. Breathing during hypercapnia is determined by reflex mechanisms but may also be influenced by respiratory sensations. The present study examined the effects of voluntary changes in level and pattern of breathing on the sensation of dyspnea at a constant level of chemical drive. Studies were carried out in 15 normal male subjects during steady-state hypercapnia at an end-tidal PCO2 of 50 Torr. The intensity of dyspnea was rated on a Borg category scale. In one experiment (n = 8), the level of ventilation was increased or decreased from the spontaneously adopted level (Vspont). In another experiment (n = 9), the minute ventilation was maintained at the level spontaneously adopted at PCO2 of 50 Torr and breathing frequency was increased or decreased from the spontaneously adopted level (fspont) with reciprocal changes in tidal volume. The intensity of dyspnea (expressed as percentage of the spontaneous breathing level) correlated with ventilation (% Vspont) negatively at levels below Vspont (r = -0.70, P less than 0.001) and positively above Vspont (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001). At a constant level of ventilation, the intensity of dyspnea correlated with breathing frequency (% fspont) negatively at levels below fspont (r = -0.69, P less than 0.001) and positively at levels above fspont (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001). These results indicate that dyspnea intensifies when the level or pattern of breathing is voluntarily changed from the spontaneously adopted level. This is consistent with the possibility that ventilatory responses to changes in chemical drive may be regulated in part to minimize the sensations of respiratory effort and discomfort.",390,0
"Vitreous changes and macular edema in central retinal vein occlusion. The condition of the posterior vitreous was determined in 56 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Using a life-table analysis, it was studied in 56 eyes. The incidence of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in the CRVO eyes at the first vitreous examination did not differ significantly from that in 64 age-matched control eyes. However, the incidence of PVD in CRVO eyes increased from 39.3% at the first vitreous examination to 58.5% after 6 months, and to 69.6% 1 year from the examination. The incidence of PVD in CRVO eyes during follow-up was statistically higher than that of the controls (P = .009). The incidence of PVD after the first vitreous examination was significantly higher in eyes with hemorrhagic retinopathy than in eyes with venous stasis retinopathy (P = .04). In the 34 eyes with macular edema, the edema lasted significantly longer in those with vitreomacular attachment (VMA) at the first examination than in those without VMA at this time (P = .02). VMA may play an important role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of macular edema in CRVO.",270,0
"Acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma mimicking Hodgkin's disease with secondary HTLV I seroconversion. The authors observed a pleiomorphic lymphoma mimicking Hodgkin's lymphoma in a French Guyana black woman lacking antibodies for human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus type I (HTLV I). After two courses of chemotherapy with either mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincaleukoblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), a typical acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma developed with HTLV I seroconversion. Specific HTLV I DNA sequences were detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a lymph node biopsy obtained before chemotherapy. The mechanisms of the seroconversion are discussed. ",164,1

"The value of symptom directed evaluation in the surveillance for recurrence of carcinoma of the breast. Specific postoperative tests used to diagnose recurrent carcinoma of the breast were evaluated for their ability to have an impact on the over-all course of the disease. Sixty-four patients with recurrent or new contralateral primary disease were divided into two groups based on the method of diagnosis. Those patients with a new complaint at an interval between scheduled follow-up visits and who went on to have tests to document a recurrence were categorized as interval follow-up. Those who were seen at a prearranged regular follow-up period and received tests as recommended by the attending physician or surgeon and had a documented recurrence were classified as routine follow-up. Thirteen patients presented with new contralateral primary disease and 51 with metastatic disease (16, bone; 13, lung; 11, local; three, liver, and eight, multiple). The median time to discovery of recurrence from the primary treatment was 29 and 28 months for the interval and routine groups, respectively. Ninety per cent of the failures occurred by 53 months. The survival time after recurrence was significantly greater in those patients diagnosed routinely (p = 0.003). However, the over-all survival time (from primary therapy to death) was only significantly improved for the routine group when the contralateral new primary diseases were included (p = 0.009). The method of diagnosis of a contralateral primary carcinoma was physical examination and mammogram. Strong recommendations for follow-up testing can be limited to mammogram and physical examination.",327,1
"Myofibroblastoma of the tongue. An immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and flow cytometric study. A case of myofibroblastoma arising in the tongue of a 77-year-old man is described. The patient presented with a submucosal tongue mass without other associated symptoms. The tumor was 2 cm in diameter, well circumscribed, and composed of uniform spindle cells arranged in fascicles. Electron microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry demonstrated a myofibroblastic origin for the tumor cells. DNA flow cytometric analysis showed a diploid DNA content of this tumor.

"Molteno implants and operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxicity. A clinicopathologic report. The right eye of a 75-year-old man with a history of cataract extraction, three penetrating keratoplasties, laser trabeculoplasty, two Molteno implants, and an operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxic lesion was studied post mortem. Histopathologic examination of the anterior segment showed evidence of penetrating keratoplasty, cataract surgery, and two Molteno implants with minimal associated tissue response. Ultrastructural examination showed a loose collagenous matrix surrounding the Molteno reservoirs, suggesting aqueous percolation from the reservoirs into the conjunctiva. Posteriorly, in the area of the phototoxic operating microscope-induced lesion, a nodule of retinal pigment epithelial hyperplasia with overlying atrophy of the photoreceptor cell layer of the neurosensory retina was noted. The retina also contained cystoid macular edema and an extensive preretinal membrane that was clinically unexpected.",193,1
"Adverse impact of fibrin clot inhibitors on intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for superficial bladder tumors. Although intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy has proved to be efficacious in the treatment and prophylaxis against tumor recurrence of superficial bladder tumors, its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Previous work has suggested that bacillus Calmette-Guerin organisms attach to the matrix protein, fibronectin, during fibrin clot formation at sites of urothelial disruption and that this attachment was required for the antitumor effect of bacillus Calmette-Guerin to be expressed. Furthermore, drugs inhibiting clot formation were found to abrogate the antitumor effect of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in a murine bladder tumor model. To examine the effect of inhibitors of fibrin clot formation on the results of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy, a retrospective analysis of 149 evaluable patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin for superficial bladder tumors was performed. The over-all response rate free of tumor for 29 patients who concomitantly received inhibitors of fibrin clot formation with bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy was 48%, as compared with 67% for 120 patients who were not receiving these medications (p = 0.0655, chi-square). The most striking difference was noted for patients who failed with recurrent superficial disease. Of the patients who received fibrin clot inhibitors during intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy 35% had recurrent superficial tumors compared to only 8% of those who did not receive these drugs during a mean followup of 29.8 plus or minus 11 months (p = 0.005, chi-square). Our study suggests that inhibitors of fibrin clot formation may have an adverse influence on the results of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for superficial bladder tumors.",405,1

"Tumor-associated neurological dysfunction prevented by lazaroids in rats. The efficacy of U-74006F and U-78517F in the treatment of blood-tumor barrier permeability and tumor-associated neurological dysfunction was evaluated in a brain-tumor model in rats. U-74006F is a 21-aminosteroid and U-78517F is a 2-methylamino chroman. Rats with stereotactically implanted Walker 256 tumors were treated with methylprednisolone, U-74006F, U-78517F, or vehicle (0.05 N HCl) on Days 6 through 10 following implantation. Neurological function and vascular permeability were assessed on Day 10. Methylprednisolone and U-74006F were equally effective at preventing neurological dysfunction compared to the control group (p less than 0.01); U-78517F was slightly less effective than U-74006F and methylprednisolone but was significantly better than vehicle in preventing neurological dysfunction. Delivery of methylprednisolone resulted in a significant decrease in tumor vascular permeability (p less than 0.006) while U-74006F and U-78517F had no effect on permeability. This suggests that U-74006F and U-78517F prevented tumor-associated neurological dysfunction by a mechanism other than decreasing permeability in tumor capillaries, and that U-74006F or U-78517F could prove useful in the treatment of brain tumors.",356,0
"Parathyroidectomy in chronic renal failure: a nine-year follow-up study. Seventy-three patients with chronic renal failure who underwent parathyroidectomy between March 1978 and April 1987 were reviewed. Thirty-four patients had undergone sub-total parathyroidectomy, and 39 patients had undergone total parathyroidectomy with parathyroid autograft into the forearm. Eight patients showed persistent hyperparathyroidism requiring a second surgical procedure. In all other patients there was highly statistical improvement in parathyroid hormone, total calcium, ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase and a significant reduction in calcium x phosphate product. Histological evidence of osteitis fibrosa was present in 21 of 22 patients before surgery. Postoperatively, four showed complete resolution and improvement. Three patients developed histological evidence of osteomalacia during the study period. Only four of the 39 patients who underwent total parathyroidectomy with autograft had true recurrent hyperparathyroidism and only two of the 34 patients who underwent sub-total parathyroidectomy had recurrent disease, indicating that there is little to choose between the two techniques in the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism and its subsequent recurrence. In one patient with recurrence of hyperparathyroidism from a forearm parathyroid graft the histological picture was different from that of normal hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Although it is probable that abnormal parathyroid tissue had been implanted there was no evidence of invasive growth into the forearm muscle. The most striking feature of long term follow-up was the difference in calcium x phosphate product in patients in whom vascular calcification increased compared to those patients with no change or regression of calcification. Mean calcium phosphate product in those patients with progressive vascular calcification was 4.93 for small and medium size vessels and 5.38 for large vessels compared to 4.10 for small and medium vessels and 4.09 for large vessels. In the former case the serum phosphate was 2.00 and 2.17 as compared to 1.75 or 1.73, suggesting that the aim in patients with end stage renal failure maintained by dialysis should be to control the serum phosphate concentration to 1.8 mmol or less and the calcium x phosphate product to less than 4.2.",484,0

"Cervical lymph node metastasis: assessment of radiologic criteria. To estimate the accuracy of different radiologic criteria used to detect cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with head and neck carcinoma, seven different characteristics of 2,719 lymph nodes in 71 neck dissection specimens from 55 patients were assessed. Three lymph node diameters, their location, their number, the presence of a tumor, and the amount of necrosis and fatty metaplasia were recorded. The minimal diameter in the axial plane was found to be the most accurate size criterion for predicting lymph node metastasis. A minimal axial diameter of 10 mm was determined to be the most effective size criterion. The size criterion for lymph nodes in the subdigastric region was 1 mm larger (11 mm). Groups of three or more borderline nodes were proved to increase the sensitivity but did not significantly decrease the specificity. Radiologically detectable necrosis (3 mm or larger) was found only in tumorous nodes and was present in 74% of the positive neck dissection specimens. Shape was not a valuable criterion for the radiologic assessment of the cervical lymph node status.",228,1
"Ultrastructural study of Norrie's disease. We studied the clinicopathologic and ultrastructural features of a full-term infant with Norrie's disease. The infant had bilateral retrolental fibrous vascular masses and retinal detachment with no other apparent physical abnormalities and no family history of ocular defects. A vitrectomy and a membrane peeling were attempted, and specimens of the retina, the retrolental membrane, and a vascularized epiretinal peripheral mass were examined by light and electron microscopy. The retrolental membrane was composed of layered collagenous tissue and contained structures resembling blood vessels. Inner and outer neuroblastic layers were identified in the retinal tissue, but no vessels were present. In the epiretinal mass, portions of retina and cortical vitreous were seen along with primitive vascular structures. The histologic appearance of these specimens suggests that the major pathologic event of Norrie's disease occurs in the retina in the third to fourth gestational month. We believe the subsequent ocular abnormalities found in this patient were secondary to this early retinal malformation and did not represent a progressive ocular disorder. ",220,0
"Miscellaneous adverse effects of low-versus high-osmolality contrast media: a study revised The authors analyzed data from two recent articles in Radiology in which the quality and results of randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy or safety of the low-osmolality contrast media (LOM) iopamidol, iohexol, and ioxaglate with that of the high-osmolarity contrast media (HOM) diatrizoate, iodamide, iopamide, iothalamate, and metrizoate were assessed. One conclusion in the source articles was that no differences were seen between the two groups of contrast media in frequency of nausea, vomiting, and urticaria. However, the LOM group included both nonionic LOM (NIM) and the ionic contrast medium ioxaglate. The authors found that various complications associated with the use of contrast media were much less common with NIM than with HOM; statistically this lower frequency is highly significant. This difference was obscured in the previous studies by the pooling of RCTs in which the less toxic NIM were used and RCTs in which the more toxic ionic contrast medium ioxaglate was used. ",240,0
"Inositol phosphate formation in the human squamous cell carcinoma line SCC-12 F: studies with bradykinin, the calcium ionophore A23187, and sodium fluoride. The phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides is an important signal transduction pathway coupled to the cell-surface receptors for several hormones and growth factors. In addition, PLC activity can be modulated by changes in intracellular calcium and activation of GTP binding proteins. In this report, differential activation of PLC in the human keratinocyte cell line SCC-12F was studied as judged by specific patterns of inositol phosphate formation. Several hormones and growth factors previously shown to stimulate PLC in a variety of cell types were screened for activity in SCC-12F cells. Only bradykinin was active, stimulating the PLC-dependent generation of inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Ins(1,4,5)P3 was rapidly metabolized to inositol(1,4)biphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) and inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), and subsequently degraded to inositol monophosphates. The response elicited by bradykinin was concentration dependent (EC50 value of 50 nM), suggesting involvement of a specific bradykinin receptor. Treatment of these cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 appeared to result in the direct formation of Ins(1,4)P2 without Ins(1,4,5)P3 as precursor. Treatment of the cells with AIF4-, a putative activator of GTP binding proteins, resulted in the generation of inositol monophosphates as the major metabolites in the absence of detectable Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation. Taken together, these observations suggest that the PLC complex present in SCC-12F cells can be differentially activated to yield either Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,4)P2, or InsP.

We describe a case of Burkitt's cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with the bilateral numb chin syndrome as the initial symptom of the disease. Postmortem study of the trigeminal nerve showed heavy infiltrations of leukemic cells and destruction of axon and myelin by leukemic cells in the mandibular nerve. ,78,0
"Shy-Drager syndrome. Effect of fludrocortisone and L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine on the blood pressure and regional cerebral blood flow. In nine cases of Shy-Drager syndrome, the changes in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow on sitting up from a supine position were studied. The influence of fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid, and L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS), a precursor of norepinephrine, on these changes was examined. On sitting up, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured by Xe133 inhalation showed a tendency to decrease. Fludrocortisone reduced the fall of the mean blood pressure significantly. DOPS reduced the fall of both the diastolic blood pressure and rCBF significantly.",175,0
"Weight gain with breast cancer adjuvant treatment. Available information suggests that individuals with breast cancer gain weight during adjuvant treatment and that this weight gain may be associated with poor prognosis. Exploration of the factors which affect weight gain may aid in developing weight control interventions for these patients. To determine the factors which are associated with weight gain, 32 women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy were followed over 2 years from the beginning of adjuvant treatment. Measures of psychologic functioning and self-reports of exercise levels and eating were assessed every 2 months during the course of treatment. Sixty-nine percent of the women gained weight over treatment, resulting in a significant weight gain for the group as a whole. Weight gain was correlated positively with several psychologic measures but not with assessed biologic measures. A multiple-regression equation using psychologic/behavioural measures of emotional discharge, logical analysis, affective regulation, interpersonal sensitivity, average number of symptoms, and obsessive compulsiveness accounted for 58% of the variance in overall weight gain. At 2 years of follow-up, 27 women had gained weight for an average of 6.03 kg. The coping style of logical analysis emerged as a significant predictor of disease recurrence, accounting for 28% of the variance in weight gain at 2 years. The results are discussed in terms of identification of women likely to gain weight during adjuvant treatment, directions for future research, and development of interventions to control weight gain.",291,1
"Lung cancer in patients younger than 40 years of age. The records of 52 patients younger than 40 years of age who had bronchogenic carcinoma diagnosed between 1965 and 1985 were reviewed. The preponderance of adenocarcinoma (54%), the lower male-female ratio in this age group compared with patients age 40 or older (2:1), the importance of cigarette smoking as a causative factor (80% of patients), the long mean duration of symptoms (5 months), and the high incidence of advanced stage at diagnosis (77% Stages III and IV) in these patients are findings similar to those reported in other published series. There was no significant difference in resectability (23% versus 19%), median survival length (5.3 months versus 6.9 months), median survival length of patients who had surgical resection (10.5 months versus 10.8 months), and 5-year survival rate (11.5% versus 6.3%) in these patients compared with a randomly selected group of 260 patients with lung cancer who were age 40 or older.",243,1
"Application of the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 on prostate biopsies to assess the fraction of human prostatic carcinoma. The feasibility of using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 as a proliferation marker in human prostatic carcinoma was studied on aspiration and core biopsy specimens obtained from 50 patients suspected of having prostate cancer. In 32 prostatic adenocarcinomas the Ki-67 index varied from 0.3 to 13.3% (mean 4.3) in cytological smears and from 0.8 to 17.8% (mean 5.1) in frozen sections from histological core biopsies. No significant correlation between the percentage of cells positive for Ki-67 and the histological tumor differentiation could be established. In 18 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia the Ki-67 index varied from 0 to 3.0% (mean 1.2) and from 0 to 3.8% (mean 1.4) in cytological and histological material, respectively. The differences in the observed Ki-67 index between benign and malignant prostatic tissues are of statistical (p less than 0.001) and of clinical significance. Nine patients who underwent endocrine treatment or radiotherapy entered a followup protocol in which the Ki-67 staining procedure was applied to periodically obtained cytological aspiration biopsies. During month 1 after the start of therapy a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in the Ki-67 index to 58% of the initial values was found, while at 2 and 3 months the proliferative fraction showed a further decrease to 27 and 7%, respectively. As a marker, the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 was shown to provide a reliable method to estimate the proliferative cell fraction of human prostate cancer.",378,1
"The intraoperative incidence of detectable bilateral and multicentric disease in papillary cancer of the thyroid. This is a prospective study to determine the incidence of grossly detectable multicentric and bilateral cancer at operation in patients who, before surgery, were believed to have a unilateral lesion. The opposite lobe was inspected at the time of operation and the surgeon made a determination as to whether there was bilateral and/or multicentric disease present. A total thyroidectomy was then carried out and the accuracy of the surgeon's judgment was established by permanent-section pathologic examination. Fifteen of the 44 patients were assessed to have gross bilateral disease. Thirteen of these were confirmed by pathologic examination. One case of microscopic bilateral disease was not recognized by the surgeon. Seventeen patients were thought to have unilateral multicentric disease. Fifteen of these cases were confirmed by microscopy and an additional seven cases were documented to have secondary foci. It is obvious from this study that most disease that is called microscopic disease is actually palpable. A review of the literature confirms this. It was very unlikely for a patient who did not have unilateral multicentric disease to have a contralateral focus of carcinoma. The incidence of bilateral disease was 32%, and the incidence of multicentric disease was 50%; the surgeon was very accurate in assessing this. We believe that surgeons who advocate lobectomy as the primary treatment for thyroid cancer are recognizing grossly detectable disease in a significant number of patients and thus are doing total thyroidectomies in most patients with bilateral disease.",308,1

"Heart disease in Asians and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Asian-Americans and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanic-Americans, and Native Americans. Generally, heart disease death rates are lower in these population groups than in Caucasians, with the notable exception of Native Americans under the age of 35. Of particular interest are data for southwestern US Native Americans and Mexican-Americans, which indicate low CHD prevalence rates despite high rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus, increasing hypertension, and low socioeconomic status. Much more research is needed to explain these and other observations. Intervention in those risk factors already identified is necessary, particularly in prevention of obesity and diabetes.",145,0
"Mycosis fungoides-like lesions associated with phenytoin and carbamazepine therapy. We report the cases of four patients who were taking the anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin or carbamazepine and in whom skin lesions developed that showed histologic features suggestive of mycosis fungoides. Two patients had a solitary lesion on the trunk, whereas the other two patients had multiple plaques. In all four patients systemic signs were absent. ",89,1
"Remodeling of myocyte dimensions in hypertrophic and atrophic rat hearts. Changes in hemodynamic load cause alterations in cardiac myocyte size, with regional variations in myocyte size distribution possible within the ventricular wall. We studied regional changes in cellular dimensions and their distribution in two models of cardiac hypertrophy and in cardiac atrophy in the rat. Combined volume-pressure overload was produced by 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) treatment; atrophy was produced by heterotopic isotransplantation. Our previous data from long-term pressure overload after aortic constriction were used for comparison. Isolated ventricular myocytes were obtained after in vitro coronary perfusion with collagenase. Cell volume and its distribution were determined; cell length was directly measured by image analysis, and cross-sectional area was estimated from the cell volume/cell length ratio, assuming a cylindrical model. Myocyte hypertrophy resulting from hyperthyroidism and aortic constriction was primarily due to increased cross-sectional area. In both cases, the relative response was greater in the right ventricle than in the left ventricle. Within the left ventricle, epimyocardial myocytes enlarged the most. Aortic constriction and T3 treatment predominantly increased the size of smaller myocytes. Heterogeneity in myocyte size increased after constriction but remained relatively unaffected after T3 treatment. Atrophy of left ventricular myocytes was due to a proportional decrease in cell length and cross-sectional area, with the greatest decrease in the left ventricular endomyocardium. Atrophy predominantly affected larger myocytes, resulting in a more homogeneous overall population of smaller myocytes. We conclude that various alterations in load lead to diverse remodeling in the myocyte population throughout the ventricular wall. In general, smaller myocytes show the highest growth potential, whereas larger myocytes exhibit the highest potential to atrophy.",362,0
Soft-tissue tumor with abnormal amianthoid collagen fibers. Electron microscopic examination of a solitary soft-tissue tumor from the face demonstrated large areas with abnormal amianthoid collagen fibers in the neoplasm. The lesion was classified as a benign neoplasm of myofibroblasts and tentatively named a myofibroblastoma. The significance of the amianthoid collagen fibers is unknown. Normal native collagen fibers were found in some parts of the neoplasm. ,94,1
"Myasthenic thymus and thymoma are selectively enriched in acetylcholine receptor-reactive T cells. We compared T-cell proliferative responses to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and to purified protein derivative (PPD) (of tuberculin) of hyperplastic thymus, thymoma, and blood cells from patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Hyperplastic MG thymus cells gave significantly higher and more consistent responses to AChR than parallel cultures of autologous blood cells, whereas responses to PPD showed an opposite trend. Thus there was a preferential localization of AChR-reactive T cells in the hyperplastic MG thymus. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between blood and thymus cell responses to PPD (but not to AChR), arguing that the hyperplastic MG thymus contains a sample of sensitized peripheral T cells. By contrast, both AChR- and PPD-responsive T cells were almost undetectable in thymus from nonmyasthenic patients, which is evidently much less receptive to circulating T cells. Cells from MG thymomas showed the highest stimulations by AChR but did not consistently react to PPD. However, the uninvolved thymus adjacent to these thymomas behaved almost identically to the hyperplastic samples described above. Our interpretation is that AChR-specific T cells are initially sensitized in the MG thymoma but are selectively trapped in the hyperplastic thymus after being primed elsewhere. ",297,0
"Blood pressure measurements during dental checkups representative of 26-hour registration. The effect of dental checkups on blood pressure was investigated. In 27 normotensive patients (13 men and 14 women) aged 22 to 64 years (mean 39.75 +/- 10.5 years), a 26-hour continuous, noninvasive blood pressure registration was carried out. Of each patient at least 175 blood pressure measurements were registered during these 26 hours, giving a total amount of 4725 blood pressure measurements. A dental checkup appointment with the family dentist was included. Blood pressure values displayed the well-known diurnal variation, but the visit to the dental surgeon was not accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. There was no significant difference between the blood pressure values during the 26-hour period and those during the checkup period. During a rest period after the dental checkup, neither the systolic nor the diastolic pressure fell to any degree in relation to the 26-hour values or the visit to the surgeon.",225,0
"Human papillomavirus in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty seven cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma were studied by applying DNA slot blot analysis and in situ hybridisation using type specific probes for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18. Cases of condyloma accuminata, cervical carcinoma, and laryngeal papilloma were used as controls. Blocks including areas of invasive carcinoma, intraepithelial neoplasia, and normal epithelium were studied in each case. No HPV genome was detectable in any of the oesophageal cases. It is concluded that these types of HPV do not have an association with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",132,1

"Primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder: favorable prognostic significance of deoxyribonucleic acid diploidy measured by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy analysis was done successfully on 38 specimens of primary bladder adenocarcinoma treated between 1954 and 1985. Of the specimens 10 (26%) were deoxyribonucleic acid diploid, 8 (21%) were tetraploid and 20 (53%) were aneuploid. Distribution of ploidy patterns between the 14 histological low grade and 24 high grade tumors was similar. Of 38 tumors 35 (92%) showed muscle invasion. One tumor arose in a previously exstrophied bladder, 10 were of urachal origin and 27 arose in an anatomically normal bladder. Of the urachal origin tumors 80% were deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploid. At 5 and 10 years after diagnosis 80 and 70%, respectively, of the patients with diploid tumors were free of disease. By contrast, at 5 and 10 years after treatment only 20 and 12%, respectively, of the patients with nondiploid tumors have not had disease progression (p less than 0.001 log-rank test). None of the 6 patients with diploid, high grade, high stage, muscle invasive tumors had subsequent progression. In contrast, 16 of 17 patients (94%) with high grade, high stage, nondiploid tumors had either local or distant tumor recurrence (p less than 0.0005). Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern appears to be the most significant prognostic information currently available to stratify expected prognosis for patients with muscle invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder. This test probably should be a standard tool in the clinical management of patients with this rare bladder malignancy.",396,1
"Familial occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. We assessed the familial occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease in Copenhagen County, where there has been a long-term interest in the epidemiology of such disorders. In 1987 we interviewed 662 patients in whom inflammatory bowel disease had been diagnosed before 1979, asking whether their first- and second-degree relatives had this disorder. Ninety-six percent of the patients (504 with ulcerative colitis and 133 with Crohn's disease) provided adequate information. RESULTS. As compared with the general population, the first-degree relatives of the 637 patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease had a 10-fold increase in the risk of having the same disease as the patients, after standardization for age and sex. The risk of having the other of the two diseases was also increased, but less so, and the increase in the risk of having Crohn's disease was not significant in the relatives of patients with ulcerative colitis. The risk of ulcerative colitis in first-degree relatives of patients with ulcerative colitis appeared to be virtually independent of the generation to which the first-degree relative belonged and of the sex of the patient and the relative. The risk of ulcerative colitis in first-degree relatives tended to be higher if the disease had been diagnosed in the patient before the age of 50, but the risk seemed to be independent of the current age of the relatives. The prevalence of the same disease as that of the patient (either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) among second-degree relatives was increased; the prevalence of the other disease was not increased. CONCLUSIONS. The 10-fold increase in the familial risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease strongly suggests that these disorders have a genetic cause.",377,0
"Recognition and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris. Atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta is common in the elderly and patients with clinical coronary artery disease. Although embolization can occur from atherosclerotic debris within the thoracic aorta, it is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of the source of a systemic embolism. In the current study, the prevalence, clinical significance and embolic potential of intraaortic atherosclerotic debris as detected by transesophageal echocardiography was determined. Intraaortic atherosclerotic debris was identified in 38 (7%) of 556 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. An embolic event occurred among 11 (31%) of the 36 study patients with intraaortic atherosclerotic debris. The incidence of an embolic event was higher when the debris was pedunculated and highly mobile (8 [73%] of 11 patients) than when it was layered and immobile (3 [12%] of 25 patients) (p less than 0.002). Among 15 patients undergoing an invasive procedure of the aorta, the incidence of embolism was 27%. In conclusion, in a patient with an embolic event, the thoracic aorta should be considered as a potential source. Transesophageal echocardiography can reliably detect intraaortic atherosclerotic debris, and when it is identified, an invasive aortic procedure should be avoided if possible.",304,0
"Oxygen free radicals in acute pancreatitis of the rat. This study aimed to assess the role of oxygen free radicals in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced in rats by infusion of the CCK-analogue cerulein (5 micrograms/kg per hour) for 30 minutes, 3.5 hours, and 12 hours. After the infusion, serum enzymes and conjugated tissue dienes and malondialdehyde were measured and tissue samples were subjected to electron and light microscopy. Electron microscopy after 30 minutes showed moderate intracellular alterations. After 3.5 hours of cerulein infusion interstitial oedema and intravascular margination of granulocytes in the pancreatic gland were seen. After 12 hours histological evaluation showed pronounced zymogen degranulation, extensive tissue necrosis, and migration of granulocytes into the tissue. Amylase and lipase activities increased 15 and 35-fold respectively during this time. After 30 minutes of cerulein infusion conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde increased, they reached their peak after 3.5 hours and decreased to normal values after 12 hours. Treatment with superoxide dismutase (100,000 U/kg/hour) and catalase (400,000 U/kg/hour) either before or after the start of the cerulein infusion prevented lipid peroxidation and reduced zymogen degranulation and tissue necrosis. Tissue oedema and inflammatory response, however, were not affected in any of the treated rats. Oxygen free radicals are instrumental in the development of acute pancreatitis. Even after its onset, scavenger treatment reduced the tissue damage normally observed.",341,0
"Angiographic assessment of the culprit coronary artery lesion before acute myocardial infarction. Serial angiographic studies of patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina suggest that the culprit plaque underlying a thrombus need not have produced severe luminal obstruction before onset of the event. An atherosclerotic coronary artery lesion can, therefore, have 2 important characteristics. First, it may be obstructive. Second, it may be ""vulnerable"" in that it has the potential to become thrombogenic if exposed to the appropriate triggering stimulus. A lesion need not be obstructive to become thrombogenic, nor do all obstructive lesions have thrombogenic potential. The cause of an infarction may thus be rupture of a nonobstructive plaque leading to occlusive thrombus formation. Because it may be difficult to predict the site of a subsequent occlusion from a coronary angiogram, coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty directed only at discernible stenotic lesions may not be effective for preventing subsequent myocardial infarctions. Appropriate therapy may need to be directed at the entire coronary tree. Such therapy might include cholesterol lowering, beta blockade and aspirin.",218,0
"Nerve growth factor stimulates protein tyrosine phosphorylation in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. The cellular actions of nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) may be mediated by changes in protein phosphorylation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of two predominant proteins of molecular mass 40 and 42 kDa is seen in PC-12 cells treated with NGF or EGF, correlating with activation of a previously identified serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein (MAP). Stimulation of phosphoprotein (pp) 40 and 42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activity by NGF but not EGF is selectively attenuated by staurosporine and K-252A. Moreover, the time courses of pp40/42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation produced by NGF or EGF are identical. Chromatography of lysates from growth factor-treated cells on ion-exchange or hydrophobic-interaction HPLC resolves MAP kinase into two peaks, neither of which precisely coelutes with pp40 or pp42. One of these peaks (II) exhibits no detectable phosphotyrosine. The other peak (I) has some overlap with pp40. However, the activity residing in both peaks is almost completely inhibited after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that, at least, serine/threonine phosphorylation is required for the activity of these enzymes. These data indicate that while tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be a critical early event in NGF action, the role of this modification in activation of MAP kinases remains unclear.",315,1
"Advances in the treatment of complex cerebrovascular disorders by interventional neurovascular techniques. Treatment of complex cerebrovascular disorders, including intracranial aneurysms, carotid cavernous sinus fistulas, vertebral fistulas, arteriovenous malformations, atherosclerosis of brachiocephalic vessels, and arterial vasospasm, is being performed in selected cases by interventional neurovascular techniques. Recent advances in microballoon technology, permanent solidifying polymers, newer embolic agents, high-resolution digital subtraction angiography with road-mapping technique, and steerable micro-guide wires and catheters have greatly improved access in the distal intracranial circulation and markedly reduced the morbidity associated with these procedures.

"Second cancer after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix. Radiation-induced cancers after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix were investigated on 11,855 patients including 5725 patients treated with radiation therapy alone, 1969 postoperative radiation therapy and 4161 surgery alone. The observed-to-expected ratios of the second primary cancer was 0.933 for the patients with radiation therapy alone and 1.074 for the patients with postoperative radiation therapy, respectively. No significant increase was observed in the risk of second primary cancers when all sites were combined. However, assessing on site by site basis, significant excess was noted for the rectum cancer, leukemia, and bladder cancer for the radiation therapy group but not for the surgery group. A significant excess of lung cancer was observed in both radiation therapy and surgery groups, which was attributed to some other causative factors. Radiation-induced cancers were suggested to develop apparently in organs involved in the irradiated field.",205,1
"Histopathologic evidence of fibrovascular ingrowth four weeks after placement of the hydroxyapatite orbital implant. We studied the histopathologic findings after placement of an orbital hydroxyapatite implant in a patient. The implant was placed after enucleation for a choroidal melanoma and was removed four weeks later because histopathologic examination of the enucleated globe disclosed tumor invasion of the optic nerve that necessitated further orbital tissue removal. Our histopathologic findings confirm that there is significant ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue in these implants, even within weeks of implantation. ",113,1
"Oncogenes and suppressor genes: their involvement in colon cancer [editorial] Abnormalities in oncogenes, which are broadly classified into viral and cellular oncogenes, and suppressor genes appear critical for the development of colon cancer. Cellular oncogenes contribute to malignant transformation when they become activated by point mutation, translocation, amplification, or loss of regulator sequences. The properties of the oncoproteins, the proteins encoded by oncogenes which are essential for carcinogenesis, are unclear. Suppressor genes normally suppress the tumorigenic phenotype by keeping the growth of cells in check; it is their inactivation that contributes to malignant transformation. Development of colon cancer appears to take place by stepwise accumulation of multiple genetic alterations during the progression from normal colon to adenoma and carcinoma. Activation of ras, an early event in this sequence, is found in 50% of colon cancers; overexpression of c-myc is found in approximately 80%. Inactivation of suppressor genes, which occurs during later stages, is noted in greater than 70% of tumors. A current model of colonic tumorigenesis is presented.",222,1
"Characteristics of an elderly driving population referred to a geriatric assessment center. A retrospective, case-control study was performed to determine the characteristics of elderly drivers referred to an outpatient geriatric assessment center. It was hypothesized that the driving population was operating at a higher cognitive and functional level than nondrivers. One hundred eighty-two subjects meeting the entry criteria were studied. Twenty-three percent of the subjects were driving at the time of their assessment. Compared to nondrivers, drivers were younger (P = .0001), were more likely to be male (P = .003), scored higher on a mental status examination (P = .0001), and were more independent in Physical and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (P less than .0001). Despite these findings, the mean Folstein Mini-Mental score for drivers (23.7) was below normal; 40% of drivers were diagnosed as having Alzheimer's dementia at the time of their evaluation, and over 26% of the drivers needed help with either dressing or bathing. The frequency of impaired elderly drivers in this referral setting was high. The authors conclude that conditions that affect the driving task are common in geriatric assessment centers. Prospective studies of elderly drivers are needed to answer the difficult question of who among the elderly should drive.",273,0
"Familial trigeminal neuralgia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Report of two families and review. Typical trigeminal neuralgia has occasionally occurred in multiple members of the same family over several generations. The clinical features of such cases, including the increased incidence in females, and the absence of other apparent hereditary, neurologic, metabolic, or structural abnormalities were identical to those of sporadic cases. More rarely, familial trigeminal neuralgia has been described in the setting of hereditary peripheral neuropathy, especially Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We describe patients from two different families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia. Both patients were successfully treated by percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis. The occurrence of cranial nerve symptoms in patients with demyelinating peripheral neuropathies is discussed in light of the current hypotheses regarding the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. ",186,0

"Tissue distribution of 2-3 and 2-6 sialyl Lewis A antigens and significance of the ratio of two antigens for the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign disorders of the digestive tract. The authors investigated the tissue distribution of two kinds of sialylated derivatives of Lewis A (Le(a)) antigen in patients with cancers of the digestive system using specific monoclonal antibodies, and evaluated the significance of determining the 2-3 and 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen levels for the diagnosis of cancer. In most specimens from patients with cancers of the pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon, the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was strongly expressed in cancer cells. However, 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen was less frequently expressed in cancer cells. The former is therefore more specific to cancer than the latter. Also, the serum level of the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was significantly higher than that of the 2-6 counterpart in patients with cancers of pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon. The resulting ratio of serum 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigens was frequently high in patients with malignancy and was low in patients with benign disorders of these digestive organs. Therefore, the 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen ratio is a useful for the differential diagnosis of malignant disorders in these organs. However, liver disorders were found to be exceptional in that both antigens were mostly absent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in immunohistologic examination, as well as in nonmalignant parenchymal liver cells. Only the epithelial cells of the intrahepatic bile ducts expressed the 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen strongly, and expressed the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen moderately. The levels of both antigens were sometimes high in patients with liver disorders, but the ratio always remained low in patients with HCC as well as benign liver disorders such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. The sialylated Le(a) antigens, which sometimes accumulate in the sera of patients with HCC, were concluded to originate from the epithelial cells of the proliferating small bile ducts, and those serum antigens cannot be considered as evidence for the presence of liver cancer cells.",479,1

"Relevance of focal cerebral ischemia models. Experience with fibrinolytic agents. Despite the limitations of individual ischemia models, experience with fibrinolytic agents suggests that 1) early intervention with rt-PA may result in rapid thrombolysis, functional recovery, and decreased mortality in small animal stroke thromboembolism models, 2) rt-PA has no general effect on clinical recovery following MCA occlusion and reperfusion in the nonhuman primate at dose rates capable of producing very high circulating rt-PA levels, while u-PA has an apparently salutary effect, and 3) intravenous infusion of rt-PA or u-PA early after ischemia/infarction in several model systems is not associated with significant intracerebral hemorrhage.

"Effect of selective elimination of the oral flora on mucositis in irradiated head and neck cancer patients. Recently it has been reported that chlorhexidine 0.1% rinsing was not successful in eradication of gram-negative bacilli in patients who have head and neck cancer. These bacilli could play a role in irradiation mucositis. This study reports the effect of lozenges containing 2 mg polymyxin E, 1.8 mg tobramycin, and 10 mg amphotericin B qid on the oropharyngeal flora in 15 irradiated head and neck cancer patients. The results were compared with those of a previous study in two groups of 15 patients comparing chlorhexidine rinsing with placebo. In all patients using lozenges, eradication of gram-negative bacilli and yeasts was achieved within 3 weeks. A significant increase of enterococci was found. Mucositis was significantly reduced compared with the previous two groups. All patients showed erythema only, whereas 80% of both the placebo and chlorhexidine rinsing patients suffered from severe mucositis, with signs of pseudomembranes developing from the third week of conventional irradiation protocol. The effect of selective elimination of gram-negative bacilli from the oropharynx and the prevention of severe mucositis may be explained by the eradication of these bacteria and/or neutralization of salivary endotoxin, released by gram-negative bacilli, mediating the inflammatory processes.",291,1
"The pathology of heart allograft rejection. The pathologist plays an important role in the care of cardiac transplant recipients. Day-to-day management of immunosuppression is largely dependent on the diagnosis and grading of acute rejection. While noninvasive methods have been tried experimentally, the endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard in monitoring the rejection status of the heart allograft. The diagnosis of rejection, however, is complicated by a variety of other histologic findings, which may be procedural or processing related, due to sampling, or specifically related to transplantation. Failed allografts, whether from autopsy or explantation, provide the opportunity to study short- and long-term changes in the transplanted heart. Allograft arteriopathy, or graft atherosclerosis, is the major limiting factor in long-term recipient survival. While the morphological features of graft arteriopathy have been well described, the mechanism and factors contributing to its development remain unclear. ",185,1
"Differentiating cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease from nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy utilizing positron emission tomography. To determine if imaging of blood flow (using N-13 ammonia) and glucose metabolism (using F-18 2-deoxyglucose) with positron emission tomography can distinguish cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease from nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, 21 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction who were evaluated for cardiac transplantation were studied. The origin of left ventricular dysfunction had been previously determined by coronary angiography to be ischemic (11 patients) or nonischemic (10 patients). Images were visually analyzed by three observers on a graded scale in seven left ventricular segments and revealed fewer defects in dilated cardiomyopathy compared with ischemic cardiomyopathy for N-13 ammonia (2.7 +/- 1.6 versus 5 +/- 0.6; p less than 0.03) and F-18 deoxyglucose (2.8 +/- 2.1 versus 4.6 +/- 1.1; p less than 0.03). An index incorporating extent and severity of defects revealed more homogeneity with fewer and less severe defects in subjects with nonischemic than in those with ischemic cardiomyopathy as assessed by imaging of flow (2.8 +/- 1.8 versus 9.2 +/- 3; p less than 0.001) and metabolism (3.8 +/- 3.3 versus 8.5 +/- 3.6; p less than 0.005). Diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing the two subgroups by visual image analysis was 85%. Using previously published circumferential count profile criteria, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy had fewer ischemic segments (0.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.5 +/- 2 per patient; p less than 0.01) and infarcted segments (0.1 +/- 0.3 versus 2.4 +/- 1.4 per patient; p less than 0.001) than did patients with cardiomyopathy of coronary artery disease. The sensitivity for differentiating the two clinical subgroups using circumferential profile analysis was 100% and the specificity 80%. An index incorporating both number and severity of defects derived from circumferential profile analysis was significantly lower in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy than in ischemic cardiomyopathy (0.3 +/- 0.8 versus 2.7 +/- 2.4; p less than 0.005). Thus, noninvasive positron emission tomographic imaging with N-13 ammonia and F-18 deoxyglucose is helpful in distinguishing patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease from those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and a semiquantitative index such as circumferential profile analysis is superior to that of visual analysis alone.",574,0
"Flow cytometric DNA analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognostic value of nuclear DNA content was studied retrospectively using flow cytometry in 203 cases of resected hepatocellular carcinoma. The occurrence of DNA aneuploidy, which was detected in 50% of patients, correlated significantly with tumor size and the presence of vascular invasion or intrahepatic metastasis. Overall, patients with DNA aneuploid tumors had a significantly worse prognosis than those with DNA diploid tumors (P less than 0.001) and, also in subdivided groups by tumor size (P less than 0.01). Among DNA aneuploid patients, the survival times were significantly shorter for patients with a low DNA index (less than 1.5) than for those with a high DNA index (greater than or equal to 1.5) (P less than 0.05). In a Cox multivariate analysis, nuclear DNA content provided significant prognostic value (P = 0.008), as did vascular invasion (P = 0.001) and intrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.005). These results indicated that nuclear DNA content has an important prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma.",250,1
"Thoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser treatment of bullous emphysema. A new technique of thoracoscopic laser ablation of pulmonary bullae suitable for patients with multiple bullae and diffuse emphysema was developed and assessed in 22 patients. 20 of 22 patients survived. Pre-operative and postoperative functional evaluation is available for the 11 patients followed up for more than a month; at 1 to 3 months postoperatively there were increases in FVC (mean 2.0 litres pre-operatively to 2.7 litres postoperatively, p less than 0.001), in FEV1 (0.74 to 1.06 litres, p = 0.01), and in maximum exercise treadmill times (5.4 min to 8.0 min, p less than 0.01). Postoperative air leaks lasted a mean of 13 days and usually resolved spontaneously. Other complications were bleeding (1 patient) and unilateral acute lung injury (1 patient). These results suggest that selected patients with diffuse emphysema and pulmonary bullae may benefit from thoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser ablation.",242,0
"Immunohistochemical detection of P-glycoprotein in endometrial adenocarcinoma. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has emerged as the central mediator in classic multidrug resistance in model systems in vitro. High levels of Pgp also have been detected in many normal human tissues and tumors; and its role in clinical drug resistance is currently under investigation. Recently significant levels of Pgp were localized to gravid and secretory endometrium; and it was demonstrated that the combination of estrogen and progesterone is sufficient to induce high levels of both Pgp mRNA and Pgp in uterine secretory epithelium. These findings suggest that increased Pgp expression also may be present in hormone-responsive malignancies such as endometrial adenocarcinoma. To determine whether Pgp is expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma, 36 endometrial adenocarcinomas (grade I [n = 17]; grade II [n = 6]; grade III [n = 13]) were investigated retrospectively by the avidin-biotin-complex immunohistochemical procedure using three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) MAb C219, MAb C494, and MAb JSB-1, which recognize spatially distinct cytoplasmic epitopes of Pgp. Seventy-two percent of the tumors showed positive immunostaining with at least one MAb; 67% showed immunostaining with MAb C219, 50% with MAb C494, and 62% with MAb JSB-1. Forty-six percent of tumors were immunoreactive to two and 29% to all three antibodies. Membranous and Golgi/paranuclear type staining patterns were observed. Overall the intensity of immunostaining varied from one sample to another for a given tumor type, and considerable heterogeneity of expression was commonly seen within a given tumor. Strong to moderate immunoreactivity was seen in diffusely infiltrating, adenosquamous, and serous papillary carcinomas. In general, immunoreactivity to MAb C494 was weaker than MAb C219 or MAb JSB-1. Adenomatous and non-neoplastic endometrium adjacent to the tumors displayed strong membranous immunostaining with MAb JSB-1. Endometrial capillaries showed weak-to-moderate immunostaining to all three antibodies. It is concluded that Pgp is commonly expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma and may be a significant factor responsible for their drug-resistant nature subject to modulation by progesterone.",499,1
"Functional outcome measures in stroke rehabilitation. I examine statistical considerations in the analysis of functional outcome following stroke and discuss the mathematical relation between improvement in function and discharge functional score. I demonstrate mathematically that the predictor variables of improvement and discharge functional score are the same and that the regression coefficients for improvement and discharge functional score will be equal, except for the admission functional score, for which a mathematically defined relation exists. I argue that the relation between admission functional score and discharge functional score must be positive and strong and that the relation between admission functional score and improvement must be negative for the stroke population. I believe that an ignorance of statistical concepts, especially confounding, and of the differences between raw correlations, partial correlations, and predictors have led to much confusion in functional outcome research.

Antivenom therapy in Russell's viper bite. Bleeding and renal failure are the two main manifestations responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in untreated Russell's viper bite victims. This study was an effort to find prognostic factors and a practical therapeutic approach for the care of such patients. Early detection of abnormalities in the clot quality test and/or evidence of systemic bleeding followed by immediate correction of the clotting defects using specific antivenom can reduce morbidity in Russell's viper envenomation. ,98,0
"Increased survival of patients with massive lymphadenopathy and prostate cancer: evidence of heterogeneous tumour behaviour. The survival of patients with prostate cancer and radiologically detectable lymph node enlargement has been studied prospectively over an 8-year period. Computed tomography in 108 patients presenting with symptoms, signs or biochemical results suggesting lymphatic spread revealed pelvic or abdominal node masses in 60 patients; in 29 (48%), the masses measured more than 4 cm and the maximum node diameter was 15 cm. Two-thirds of patients had advanced (T3/T4) tumour stage. Following treatment, actuarial survival in all 60 patients with nodal enlargement was 40% at 5 years. Within this group, survival in 22 patients with lymphadenopathy but negative bone scans at diagnosis was significantly better than that of 38 patients with both node and bone disease (70% vs 20% at 5 years). This improvement was related both to an apparent inability of certain tumours initially to progress and seed within bone and to a marked sensitivity of the node masses to subsequent hormonal manipulation. Primary tumour grade was proportionally similar in both groups. Unexpectedly, 6 of the 38 patients with combined disease obtained a complete remission after treatment. The reason for this heterogeneous biological behaviour remains unclear; but these observations underscore the importance of vigorous treatment in all patients with advanced lymph node disease.",289,1
"Epidural anaesthesia for labour and caesarean section in a parturient with a single ventricle and transposition of the great arteries. We describe a case of a 29-year-old parturient with a single ventricle and transposition of the great arteries who had lumbar epidural analgesia/anaesthesia with a local anaesthetic for labour, emergency Caesarean section and postoperative pain. Her outcome and that of her baby was successful. The anaesthetic techniques used in other parturients with similar congenital cardiac anomalies are reviewed.",107,0
"Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix. A report of the Central Netherlands Registry with emphasis on early detection and prognosis. The Central Netherlands Registry (CNR) of women with vaginal or cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCAC) was established in 1985. An overview is presented of clinical and pathologic data of 55 patients who were registered at the CNR until July 1, 1988. All Netherlands Departments of Pathology (NDP) maintain a patient registry and 95% of the Institutes are connected with a Central Archive via a computer network. The histologic slides and clinical status were reviewed at the CNR. Twenty-five tumors were classified as vaginal carcinoma and 30 as cervical carcinoma. The mean age of the patients was 22 years. Fifty-five percent of patients (63% of patients with known maternal history) were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. The majority of cases was initially diagnosed after 1980. Cytologic examination before the initial histologic diagnosis indicated that cervical tumors were detected in 80% of cases, but vaginal tumors were detected only in 33% of cases. It was concluded that an examination of DES-exposed women should consist of colposcopic inspection of the cervix and vagina, cytologic examination of the cervix and four quadrants of the vagina, and careful palpation of the cervix and the entire vaginal wall. The most important prognostic parameter for patients with CCAC was stage and grade of nuclear atypia. The results of a statistical analysis showed that these features were the most effective to distinguish between nonsurvivors and patients surviving more than 5 years.",347,1
"Insulin-like growth factor-I receptors in nonfunctioning thyroid nodules. We have recently demonstrated the production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) as well as the presence of type I IGF receptors in human thyroid cells in primary culture. The role of IGF-I in the control of thyroid cell growth has been well established. In order to investigate the involvement of IGF-I in abnormal thyroid growth, the density of IGF-I receptors in solitary, cold, micro- and macro-follicular thyroid adenomas, and in extranodular histological normal tissue was studied. Forty-three euthyroid patients with isolated cold nodules were selected for the study. In 30 patients the presence of IGF-I receptors was evaluated by using quantitative immunohistochemistry; in 10 patients by using radioligand binding studies, and in 3 patients by using affinity labeling. Cross-linking and binding studies clearly demonstrated the presence of a homogeneous class of binding sites for type I IGF receptors. Furthermore, radioligand studies did not show any significant differences in receptor density between the 2 types of thyroidal tissues. Conversely, the computerized analysis of 900 fields of nodular and normal thyroid tissues immunostained with the monoclonal antibody alpha-IR3, strongly indicated that higher concentrations of IGF-I receptors were present in the epithelial cells of non-functioning thyroid nodules than in the adjacent extranodular thyroid tissues. These studies strongly suggest that the same type I IGF receptor is present in thyroid follicular adenomas as in histological normal thyroid tissue removed from the same patient. The higher concentration of IGF-I receptors as documented by immunostaining in the adenomas suggests that IGF-I may contribute to the abnormal growth of the neoplasms.",354,1
"Thyroglobulin level as a predictive factor of tumoral recurrence in differentiated thyroid cancer. Ninety-eight patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma were studied. Actuarial methods were used to investigate the 10-yr probability of survival (pS) and disease-free survival (pDFS). Our results show that the pDFS is a function of: (1) clinicopathologic stage: Stages I-II, pDFS = 90.9% +/- 5.0% versus Stages III-IV, pDFS = 55.9% +/- 17.8% (p less than 0.005); (2) age: Age less than 45 yr, pDFS = 87.2% +/- 10.0% versus age greater than or equal to 45 yr, pDFS = 66.6% +/- 12.0% (p less than 0.002); and (3) plasma thyroglobulin (Tg) levels: Tg less than or equal to 23 ng/ml, pDFS = 100% versus Tg greater than 23 ng/ml, pDFS = 68.3% +/- 10.6% (p less than 0.005). Using the multivariate analysis of proportional risk, the regression coefficients obtained (Stage: beta = 0.7615; Age: beta = 1.6398, and Tg: beta = 1.7607) allowed us to establish two different groups of risk of relapse on the basis of a prognostic index.",340,1
"A self-administered hand symptom diagram for the diagnosis and epidemiologic study of carpal tunnel syndrome. Noninvasive tests for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are of limited diagnostic value. A self-administered hand symptom diagram has been developed for use in the diagnosis and epidemiologic study of CTS. Diagrams are rated classic CTS, probable, possible or unlikely. Diagram ratings were compared with nerve conduction diagnoses in 110 patients with upper extremity complaints. A hand diagram rating of classic or probable CTS had sensitivity of 0.64, specificity of 0.73 and positive predictive value of 0.58. The negative predictive value of an unlikely diagram was 0.91. We conclude that the diagram is a useful diagnostic tool and may be valuable for occupational and population screening.",162,0
"Glomus tumours of the skin: an immunohistochemical investigation of the expression of marker proteins. Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on cutaneous glomus tumours from 10 patients. The glomus areas in these tumours reacted strongly with anti-smooth muscle (CGA-7), anti-muscle (HHF-35) and anti-vimentin antibodies. Their neural supply was analysed using several nervous tissue markers (anti-neurone specific enolase, anti-S 100, anti-Leu 7, anti-neurofilaments). The results indicate a sprouting and proliferation rather than entrapment of pre-existing nerve fibres.",132,1
"Mammography and age: are we targeting the wrong women? A community survey of women and physicians. To determine mammography use among women with a broad range of ages, the authors surveyed women aged 30 to 74 years and physicians practicing primary care in two eastern North Carolina counties. Twenty-five percent of women in their 30s had ever had a mammogram, and 34% intended to have one in the coming year. From 45% to 52% of women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s had ever had a mammogram, and 55% to 57% intended to have one in the next year. Thirty-seven percent of women aged 70 to 74 years had ever had a mammogram, and 40% intended to have one in the following year. Nineteen percent of physicians reported screening nearly all women aged 30 to 39 years, and 14% screened few women aged 50 to 74 years. Younger women were more worried about breast cancer than older women and assessed their risk as higher, attitudes that were generally associated with higher mammography utilization. These community surveys suggest that mammography use may be excessive among younger women; older women continue to be underscreened.",274,1
"Obesity, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and response to antihypertensive drugs. Responsiveness to antihypertensive medications was investigated cross-sectionally in 559 individuals comprising all treated hypertensive patients identified within a representative sample (n = 3,532, aged 40-70 years) of the Jewish population in Israel. A rate of dosage score (a summed ranking of dosages of all drugs taken) of two or more increased significantly with increasing levels of body mass index (BMI) from 37.5% in levels less than 23, 54.9% in levels 23.0-29.9, and 76.4% in levels of 30 or greater (p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analyses, adjusting for age, gender, arm circumference, and ethnic group, confirmed the independent effect of BMI on dosage score (p less than 0.001). At each level of dosage score, mean blood pressure levels were equivalent at all levels of BMI after adjusting for potential confounders. This indicates that achieved blood pressure level and not BMI itself was the main determinant of the higher dosing regimens prescribed at higher levels of BMI. In representative subgroups, glucose tolerance (n = 372) and hyperinsulinemia (n = 190) were determined and were found to be positively associated with a dosage score of two or more (p less than 0.05) independently of BMI. These effects could not be accounted for by poor compliance or by altered drug absorption or disposition since overnight urinary drug excretion and plasma drug concentrations 2 hours after ingestion, measured in 80 randomly selected patients from the study group, were not different across BMI categories at similar dosages.",371,0
"Amplification of oncogenes in mammary carcinoma shown by fine-needle biopsy. A procedure that measures the amplification of oncogenes in human cancer cells is described. The cells were obtained by fine-needle biopsy to allow repeated sampling from individual metastases. A drawback was the low number of cells obtained, but this could be overcome by using a slot-blot hybridization technique to measure gene amplification. Two patients with mammary cancer (primary tumors or metastases), analyzed for the levels of amplification of the oncogene erb-B2, are described in detail. This technique is suitable for analyzing alterations occurring during cancer progression and for identifying subgroups of mammary cancer with different characteristics.",131,1
"Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content in partial hydatidiform moles with persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor. Hydatidiform moles may be classified as partial or complete based on genetic and pathologic criteria. Between January 1979 and January 1990, 17 (5.5%) of 310 patients followed for partial mole developed persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor. Tissues from 14 partial moles were available for flow cytometric analysis of DNA content. Eleven partial moles (85%) were triploid, two (15%) were diploid, and one DNA histogram was uninterpretable. All patients with triploid partial moles achieved complete remission with one course of single-agent chemotherapy. The two with diploid partial mole required multiple courses of chemotherapy to achieve gonadotropin remission. Although the DNA content of most partial moles with persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor was triploid, diploid partial moles with persistent tumor were less sensitive to single-agent chemotherapy.",199,1
"Experience with in situ saphenous vein bypasses during 1981 to 1989: determinant factors of long-term patency. From 1981 to 1989, 361 consecutive in situ saphenous vein bypasses were performed. Indications for revascularization were critical limb ischemia (n = 335, 93%), popliteal aneurysm (n = 15, 4%), and claudication (n = 11, 3%). Outflow tract was the popliteal artery in 116 (32%) and tibial artery in 245 (68%) of bypasses. At 6 years primary patency was 63% and secondary patency was 81%. During the performance of the in situ bypass procedure, 86 (24%) venous conduits were modified because of a technical failure (n = 49, 13%) or an inadequate vein segment (n = 37, 10%). Secondary patency at 4 years for bypasses requiring modification was 72% compared to 84% for bypasses not modified (p less than 0.05). Atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery necessitating endarterectomy, patch angioplasty, or replacement lowered primary patency at 3 years (69%) compared to the inflow artery not requiring reconstruction (46%, p less than 0.02). In the follow-up period, 95 (26%) bypasses were revised because of thrombosis or hemodynamic failure. Bypasses requiring revision had a 4-year secondary patency of 68% compared to 88% for bypasses not revised (p less than 0.02). The first 179 cases (1981 to 1985) were compared to the subsequent 182 cases (1986 to 1989). The secondary patency at 3 years for the latter half (92%) compared to the first half (80%) of the experience was significantly improved (p less than 0.02). The secondary patency for bypasses not requiring revision was significantly improved (p less than 0.02) for the latter half (n = 142, 97%) compared to the first half (n = 124, 83%) of the series. Long-term patency with the in situ saphenous vein bypass is dependent on surgical experience, quality of the venous conduit, and atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery that necessitates reconstruction. Meticulous surgical technique and compulsive bypass surveillance results in superior long-term patency.",577,0
"The value of push-type jejunal endoscopy in familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Push-type jejunal endoscopy using a long forward-viewing duodenofiberscope was performed in 10 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome. Jejunal polypoid lesions were detected in nine of the 10 patients (90%). The lesions appeared sessile, whitish, and measured 3 mm or less in diameter. Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from these polypoid lesions revealed tubular adenoma in all nine patients. In addition, this method led to the detection of duodenal adenomas in one patient, in whom duodenofiberscopy with the side-viewing instrument revealed no polypoid lesions in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum. In view of these results, we recommend that push-type jejunal endoscopy, as well as side-viewing duodenofiberscopy, should be added to the usual preoperative examinations done in patients with this disease.",215,1
"A critical review of chemical lymph node clearance and staging of colon and rectal cancer at Ferguson Hospital, 1977 to 1982 A unique opportunity to evaluate the method of chemical lymph node clearance for colorectal cancer exists at Ferguson Hospital. Lymph node clearance has been used at the institution since 1977, and this retrospective analysis was undertaken to ascertain its validity there. Furthermore, the node positive group was evaluated to ascertain if the current staging system (Turnbull, 1967) is prognostically accurate for the Dukes' C group. Specifically evaluated for possible prognostic variance was the survival of those patients whose tumors demonstrated partial bowel wall penetration and only one to four positive nodes, a ""C1 subset,"" previously reported to have favorable prognosis. Eight hundred sixty-four cases of colon and rectal cancer treated surgically from 1977 to 1982 were analyzed. There was a mean of 27 lymph nodes retrieved per specimen and a mean of 4.5 positive nodes per Dukes' C specimen. There were 43 C1 and 201 C2 cases with five-year survival rates of 73 and 38 percent, respectively. The results of chemical clearance at Ferguson Hospital were found to be comparable with that of other centers using chemical clearance and superior to hand dissection. The C1 subset clearly is noted to have prognostic advantage and should occupy a separate designation in any staging system.",295,1
"Estimation of PR and ER by immunocytochemistry in breast cancer. Comparison with radioligand binding methods. Immunocytochemical assays for progesterone receptor (PR) using monoclonal antirabbit PR antibodies (PR-ICA) and for estrogen receptor (ER) (ER-ICA) were compared with radioligand binding (dextran-coated charcoal [DCC]) methods for receptor determination in patients with breast cancer. Immunocytochemical staining for PR was exclusively nuclear in localization. In this regard, PR staining is similar to previous findings for ER; PR-ICA showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100%. ER-ICA was also 89% sensitive and similarly specific. There was good correlation between the degree and intensity of staining and quantitative binding of radioligand. Receptor-positive tumors, however, show considerable variation of immunocytochemical staining, suggesting heterogeneity of cellular PR content. The availability of an immunocytochemical assay for PR increases the discriminatory potential for these methods of receptor determination.",203,1
"Immunohistochemical detection of P-glycoprotein in endometrial adenocarcinoma. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has emerged as the central mediator in classic multidrug resistance in model systems in vitro. High levels of Pgp also have been detected in many normal human tissues and tumors; and its role in clinical drug resistance is currently under investigation. Recently significant levels of Pgp were localized to gravid and secretory endometrium; and it was demonstrated that the combination of estrogen and progesterone is sufficient to induce high levels of both Pgp mRNA and Pgp in uterine secretory epithelium. These findings suggest that increased Pgp expression also may be present in hormone-responsive malignancies such as endometrial adenocarcinoma. To determine whether Pgp is expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma, 36 endometrial adenocarcinomas (grade I [n = 17]; grade II [n = 6]; grade III [n = 13]) were investigated retrospectively by the avidin-biotin-complex immunohistochemical procedure using three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) MAb C219, MAb C494, and MAb JSB-1, which recognize spatially distinct cytoplasmic epitopes of Pgp. Seventy-two percent of the tumors showed positive immunostaining with at least one MAb; 67% showed immunostaining with MAb C219, 50% with MAb C494, and 62% with MAb JSB-1. Forty-six percent of tumors were immunoreactive to two and 29% to all three antibodies. Membranous and Golgi/paranuclear type staining patterns were observed. Overall the intensity of immunostaining varied from one sample to another for a given tumor type, and considerable heterogeneity of expression was commonly seen within a given tumor. Strong to moderate immunoreactivity was seen in diffusely infiltrating, adenosquamous, and serous papillary carcinomas. In general, immunoreactivity to MAb C494 was weaker than MAb C219 or MAb JSB-1. Adenomatous and non-neoplastic endometrium adjacent to the tumors displayed strong membranous immunostaining with MAb JSB-1. Endometrial capillaries showed weak-to-moderate immunostaining to all three antibodies. It is concluded that Pgp is commonly expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma and may be a significant factor responsible for their drug-resistant nature subject to modulation by progesterone.",499,1
"Linkage of early-onset familial breast cancer to chromosome 17q21. Human breast cancer is usually caused by genetic alterations of somatic cells of the breast, but occasionally, susceptibility to the disease is inherited. Mapping the genes responsible for inherited breast cancer may also allow the identification of early lesions that are critical for the development of breast cancer in the general population. Chromosome 17q21 appears to be the locale of a gene for inherited susceptibility to breast cancer in families with early-onset disease. Genetic analysis yields a lod score (logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage) of 5.98 for linkage of breast cancer susceptibility to D17S74 in early-onset families and negative lod scores in families with late-onset disease. Likelihood ratios in favor of linkage heterogeneity among families ranged between 2000:1 and greater than 10(6):1 on the basis of multipoint analysis of four loci in the region.",199,1
"Blood conservation in cardiac surgery. We reviewed current blood conservation techniques and their use in cardiac surgery. Avoidance of aspirin preoperatively is an important blood conservation measure. Patients scheduled for an elective operation should participate in autologous predonation programs. With careful monitoring, patients with major coronary artery disease can safely donate blood preoperatively. Intraoperative processing of blood withdrawn before cardiopulmonary bypass provides autologous platelet-rich plasma for infusion after reversal of heparin sodium. Blood collected from the field during operation and blood remaining in the oxygenator after bypass can also be processed to yield washed and concentrated red blood cells for reinfusion. Randomized, prospective studies document that postoperative autotransfusion is both safe and effective in reducing homologous blood use. Aprotinin reduces plasma protein activation and platelet damage during bypass. The integration of available blood conservation techniques into a comprehensive program combined with careful consideration of the indications for transfusion may allow more patients to avoid transfusion entirely.

"Hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) frequently develop hepatic dysfunction. Although hepatic injury may indirectly result from malnutrition, hypotension, administered medications, sepsis, or other conditions, the hepatic injury is frequently due to opportunistic hepatic infection, directly related to AIDS. Infection with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare typically occurs in patients with advanced immunocompromise and with systemic symptoms due to widely disseminated infection. In contrast, hepatic tuberculosis often occurs with less advanced immunocompromise. Cytomegaloviral infection may produce a hepatitis. Cytomegaloviral and cryptosporidial infections have been implicated as causes of acalculous cholecystitis and of a secondary sclerosing cholangitis. About 10-20% of patients with AIDS have chronic hepatitis B infection. These patients tend to develop minimal hepatic inflammation and necrosis. The clinical findings in patients with hepatic cryptococcal infection are usually due to concomitant extrahepatic infection. Hepatic histoplasmosis usually develops as part of a widely disseminated infection with systemic symptoms. Hepatic involvement by Kaposi's sarcoma is rarely documented ante mortem because an unguided liver biopsy is an insensitive diagnostic procedure. Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver typically have lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and systemic symptoms. As a pragmatic approach, patients with liver dysfunction and HIV-related disease should have a sonographic or computerized tomographic examination of the liver. Patients with dilated bile ducts should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography because opportunistic infection may produce biliary obstruction. Patients with a focal hepatic lesion should be considered for a guided liver biopsy. Patients with a significantly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level should be considered for a percutaneous liver biopsy. When performed for these indications, liver biopsy will demonstrate a significant disease involving the liver in about 50% of patients with AIDS and in about 25% of patients who are HIV seropositive but who are not known to have AIDS. The clinical impact of a diagnostic biopsy is blunted by a lack of efficacious therapy for many opportunistic infections.",425,0
"Coexpression of two fibronectin receptors, VLA-4 and VLA-5, by immature human erythroblastic precursor cells. Human erythroblastic precursor cells adhere to fibronectin (Fn) but the exact nature of the receptors mediating this interaction has not been characterized. In this study, we report data showing that immature human erythroblasts express the integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 and that both these molecules act as fibronectin receptors on these cells. We have recently demonstrated that adhesion to Fn of purified human CFU-E and their immediate progeny preproerythroblasts was inhibited by antibodies directed against the human fibronectin receptor (VLA-5). Here we have extended those results and characterized by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies the integrins expressed on surface-labeled normal human immature erythroblasts. A polyclonal antibody recognizing the common VLA beta 1 subunit yielded two polypeptides of 120 and 160 kD. Our data further demonstrate that the polypeptide of 160 kD contains alpha subunits corresponding to both alpha 4 and alpha 5. Thus, erythroblast lysates prepared in 0.3% CHAPS and immunoprecipitated with antibodies which specifically recognize the alpha 4 subunit showed a heterodimer with peptides of 120 (beta 1) and 160 kD (alpha 4) and the additional peptides of 70 and 80 kD which usually coprecipitate with the alpha 4 chain. On the other hand, specific anti-alpha 5 antibodies immunoprecipitated an alpha 5/beta 1 complex with peptides of 120 and 160 kD which under reducing conditions migrated as a single band of 130 kD. Similar experiments performed with an erythroleukemic cell line (KU 812) showed that these cells also coexpress both the VLA-4 and VLA-5 members of the integrin family. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies recognizing the VLA alpha 4 chain blocked the adhesion of immature erythroblasts to Fn-coated surfaces, thus demonstrating that, as VLA-5, VLA-4 is also a functional Fn receptor on these cells.",457,1
"Lymphocyte subset distribution after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix. Possible prognostic implications and correlation with disease course. An analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations was done in patients with cancer of the uterine cervix before and at different intervals after the commencement of radiation therapy. A common feature was a duration of T-cell and B-cell lymphopenia after therapy. The findings relating to the T-cell subsets were interesting. Although the CD4/CD8 ratio remained unchanged in Stages I/IIA for 24 months after treatment, patients with Stages IIB and III showed a lowering of the ratio immediately after treatment. Distinctive patterns of lymphocyte subset distribution were seen in a comparison between patients who were disease-free and those with recurrent disease. The CD4+ cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratio differed between the two groups, with consistent lowered values during the follow-up associated with recurrent disease. This study demonstrates the effects of radiation therapy in altering lymphocyte subset distribution, resulting in characteristic patterns which could be used as clinical and prognostic indicators.",210,1
"Downslope claudication in eosinophilic fasciitis: a fourth type of claudication--case presentations. Two patients who presented with discomfort in the calves while walking down a slope were diagnosed as suffering from eosinophilic fasciitis of the lower limbs. Following therapy of the underlying disease, this peculiar discomfort remitted concomitantly with the disappearance of the subcutaneous abnormalities. The authors posit that downslope claudication of the calves in eosinophilic fasciitis constitutes an additional variant of claudication of the lower limbs. ",104,0
"Orbital compartment syndrome. Direct measurement of orbital tissue pressure: 1. Technique. Many disorders of the orbit produce an increase in intraorbital pressure, which may result in the development of an orbital compartment syndrome and visual loss. Traditionally, orbital tension is assessed clinically by indirect means based on retrodisplacement of the globe. The authors describe their experience with the ""slit-catheter"" technique for direct tissue pressure measurement as applied to the orbit. The preliminary results indicate that normal orbital pressure ranges from 3.0 to 6.0 mm Hg. In patients with Graves' orbitopathy the values ranged from 7.0 to 15.0 mm Hg. The results suggest that the technique may have many exciting possibilities as a clinical research tool in orbital disease, and its use will result in better understanding of orbital compartment syndromes.",168,0
"The effect of age on treatment choice and survival in elderly breast cancer patients. To investigate the effect of age on treatment choice and survival in patients with breast cancer, data from the cancer registry of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) on 611 women have been analyzed. All patients 55 years and older admitted to the NKI for primary treatment of breast cancer between 1981 and 1986 were selected. For women 75 years and older, physicians were less likely to use treatment of adjuvant radiation therapy after a mastectomy and more often employed primary hormonal therapy only for local stage disease than for younger patients. Life-table analysis showed that disease-specific survival at 7 years for patients 65 through 74 years of age was significantly better (65%) than that of the youngest (55%) and the oldest age group (50%). In multivariate regression analysis (Cox), age older than 74 years was significantly and independently associated with a shorter disease-specific survival as compared with patients younger than 75 years. This difference in survival, however, does not seem to be the result of the difference in treatment between the age groups, but suggests an influence of age-related factors such as comorbid diseases and weak physical condition, which manifest themselves most strongly in the oldest age category and make the older woman more vulnerable to the course of malignant disease.",293,1
"The management of aneurysms and arterio-venous fistulae of the popliteal artery arising from war trauma. Emphasis on sigmoid operative approach. Between 1986-1988, 600 vascular cases arising from the Iran-Iraq conflict were dealt with within an 18 month period and 60 cases of popliteal artery and/or venous disruption were encountered presenting at variable times after injury. A policy of management between the forward and base hospital surgical teams was introduced, observing the following broad categorizations: (a) assessment/referral, (b) assessment/fasciotomy/referral, (c) immediate operation/referral for further operation/review/management. Two types of incision were used to enter the popliteal fossa: (a) a medial incision and (b) a sigmoid posterior incision (which we now favor). The results of this strategy of management and operative technique (when compared with our previous experience within the same time frame) suggested an improved outcome. Fifty-four out of 60 cases had a satisfactory operative result with below-knee amputation being required in only four cases and higher amputations in two others. No operative or postoperative deaths occurred. The implementation of this ""vetting policy"" at the front line appeared to reduce the number of amputations and assisted the clarification of management criteria in assessing limb viability at the forward hospital when a large number of casualties were being received. Operative access using the sigmoid posterior incision was not associated with any complications, offered better exposure than the medial incision and was technically easier for the surgeon to perform.",325,0
Gastroduodenal mucosa in uraemia: endoscopic and histological correlation and prevalence of helicobacter-like organisms. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of endoscopic and histological gastroduodenitis as well as helicobacter-like organisms in patients with end stage renal failure undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. A total of 322 out of 422 patients in our dialysis programme underwent endoscopy and gastroduodenal biopsy specimens were taken from 260. Endoscopic gastroduodenitis occurred in 158 (49%). Histological gastritis occurred in the gastric body or antrum in 134 patients (52%) and duodenitis in 52 (21%). There was no correlation between endoscopic and histological gastritis in contrast to a significant correlation for duodenitis. Helicobacter-like organisms occurred in the body or antrum in 81 (31%). Their presence was associated with gastritis--in particular acute and acute on chronic gastritis rather than chronic gastritis. Patients with gastritis were significantly older than those without (p less than 0.001) and had lower basal and peak acid outputs.,236,0
"Expression of laminin and its receptor LBP-32 in human and rat hepatoma cells. Dramatic cellular changes that occur during hepatocarcinogenesis are associated with major alterations in extracellular matrix formation and in the relationships between cells and their microenvironment. We have studied the expression of laminin, the major noncollagenous glycoprotein of basement membrane, and the laminin receptor 32 kD laminin-binding protein in two rat (Faza 967 and HTC) and two human (HepG2 and HBGC2) hepatoma cell lines that express a variety of liver-specific functions. Laminin was found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells when the indirect immunoperoxidase method and electron microscopic examination were used. Radiolabeled laminin, immunoprecipitated from both media and cell extracts, was resolved by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel in two major polypeptides that comigrated with the A and B subunits from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor laminin. Immunoblot analysis showed that the Mr = 400,000 polypeptide did not correspond to the A subunit of laminin. Northern blot analyses demonstrated large amounts of B1 and B2 mRNAs but no A chain mRNA. We conclude that the tumor cells produce the laminin B chains only. In contrast, normal adult hepatocytes from either man or rat lacked laminin mRNAs, whereas in 1-day primary culture, B chain mRNAs became detectable. The steady-state level of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNA was 10-fold and threefold higher in rat hepatoma cells than in freshly isolated and 1-day cultured normal rat hepatocytes, respectively. In human hepatocytes, the steady-state levels of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNAs varied depending on the donor and never reached the level of the human hepatoma cells.",392,1
"Hormonal treatment of functional ovarian cysts: a randomized, prospective study. Estrogen (E)/progestin therapy for functional ovarian cysts is widely used in clinical practice, but the efficacy of this treatment has not been determined in controlled trials. In this study, we examined the effect of E/progestin administration in a group of infertility patients enrolled in a program of ovulation induction who had cysts identified by transvaginal sonography. Patients were randomized to receive either norethindrone 1 mg/mestranol 0.05 mg/d (group A, n = 24) or no treatment (group B, n = 24) for up to 6 weeks. Patients were re-evaluated by sonography at 3, 6, and 9 weeks after entry into the protocol. The ages, mean cyst diameters, and proportions of patients having received gonadotropins in the previous menstrual cycle were not significantly different among the two groups. All patients who had a sonographic abnormality persisting for 9 weeks were surgically explored and found to have pathological cysts. The rate of disappearance of functional ovarian cysts was not affected by E/progestin treatment.",241,1
"Utility of upper endoscopy in the evaluation of noncardiac chest pain. The diagnostic yield of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry, and Bernstein testing was assessed in 100 consecutive patients being evaluated for non-cardiac chest pain. Manometric studies revealed the nutcracker esophagus in 21 patients; non-specific esophageal motility disorders in 19 patients; a hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter in 4 patients; diffuse esophageal spasm in 2 patients; and normal motility in 54 patients. Endoscopy was normal in 38 patients; but revealed grades II to IV esophagitis in 24 patients; gastritis and/or duodenitis in 18 patients; a sliding hiatal hernia without evidence of esophagitis in 14 patients; and gastric or duodenal ulcers in 6 patients. Twenty-five individuals were found to have normal manometric studies in combination with a negative Bernstein test. Among these 25 patients, however, 7 patients had esophagitis (grade II or higher); 6 patients had gastritis and/or duodenitis; five patients had a sliding hiatal hernia without esophagitis; 1 patient had peptic ulcer disease; and only 6 patients had a normal endoscopic exam. Our results indicate that endoscopy can identify a significant number of patients with acid-peptic disease who present with non-cardiac chest pain, that would not have been otherwise diagnosed by esophageal manometry or Bernstein testing alone or in combination.",317,0
"Legislative influences on cancer care. Deficit reduction politics was a major force in policymaking in the 1980s and a pervasive fact of life in the development of health policy. The Medicare budget was habitually used to find savings for deficit reduction and reforms, such as how to address the problem of 31 to 37 million uninsured Americans, were postponed. The 101st Congress did produce major physician payment reforms and in the spring of 1990, the Pepper Commission issued its recommendations for access to care and long-term care. Less sweeping but significant proposals affecting cancer care were considered by Congress. For example, positive actions were taken on anti-smoking and food labeling proposals. Funding for the National Institutes of Health was increased, and there was a growing awareness of the threat to biomedical research presented by assaults on animal research facilities.",174,1
"Synchronous diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as splenomegaly and iron deficiency anemia. Diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (D-WDLL) and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) represent closely related neoplasms which may have indolent courses.

"Primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the aorta associated with aortic dissection. We report a unique case of primary aortic malignant fibrous histiocytoma presenting clinically as aortic dissection. To our knowledge, this occurrence is the first ever reported.

Aortic tumor, although rare, should be included among the causes of aortic dissection. ",87,0
"Thalidomide: treatment of severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis in patients with AIDS. An increasing number of AIDS patients have been noted to suffer severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), a condition often associated with high morbidity that remains unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions. In two cases thalidomide was administered to successfully treat AIDS patients with RAS. Both patients experienced complete abatement of pain shortly after therapy was initiated. Ulcerations that were present for months resolved after three or four weeks of thalidomide therapy without any adverse effects. Thalidomide appears to be an effective agent for the treatment of severe RAS unresponsive to traditional therapies. ",129,0
"Cholangiocarcinoma. The diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma can now be made with greater rapidity and accuracy. In the clinical setting of obstructive jaundice, a CT scan or sonogram may suggest cholangiocarcinoma if dilated intrahepatic ducts are seen with a nondilated extrahepatic biliary tree. The diagnosis is confirmed by cholangiography, and the tumor is staged by the combination of cholangiography and angiography. If the tumor extensively involves both lobes of the liver or involves the main portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion is considered unresectable. These patients are best palliated nonoperatively, but they should still have an attempt at a tissue diagnosis, as various other lesions can masquerade as cholangiocarcinoma. In comparison, if the tumor is confined to or is distal to the hepatic duct bifurcation, extends into only one lobe of the liver, or involves only the right or the left portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion may be resectable, and exploration is indicated. As many as half of all patients explored with curative intent will have a successful resection. Various surgical options are appropriate for patients undergoing tumor resection, depending on the site and extent of the lesion. Similarly, several surgical options are possible for palliation in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. The role of radiotherapy in the management of cholangiocarcinoma is uncertain. Our results, like those of many other retrospective analyses, suggest that radiotherapy prolongs survival after curative resection as well as after palliative stenting. However, further data from randomized studies are necessary to support or refute this impression. Further studies of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy will also be necessary to improve patient survival. ",339,1
"Perforin-mediated myocardial damage in acute myocarditis. Endomyocardial specimens were obtained from 7 patients with acute myocarditis. Immunohistochemical examination of the mononuclear infiltrate showed mainly cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Perforin (a pore-forming protein found in cytotoxic lymphocytes) was identified in this myocardial lymphocytic infiltrate and electron microscopy showed myocardial cell damage that may have been associated with these perforin containing lymphocytes. The results indicate that in acute idiopathic and viral myocarditis, myocardial damage may be due to the action of perforin-secreting lymphocytes.",115,0
"Prospective, randomized trial of palliative treatment for unresectable cancer of the esophagus. To evaluate the best method of palliation for obstructing nonresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the mid or distal esophagus, 27 patients were prospectively randomized to one of three treatment arms: (1) esophageal intubation with an Atkinson tube (AT, 10 patients), (2) esophageal intubation followed by radiation therapy (AT/RT, 8 patients), and (3) endoscopic laser therapy followed by irradiation (L/RT, 9 patients). Pretreatment characteristics were similar in the three groups. There was no procedure-related mortality. There were eight total complications related to the tube and none related to laser treatment (p = 0.02). Mean survival was 119 days in the AT group, 72 days in the AT/RT group, and 169 days in the L/RT arm (p = not significant). Quality of survival was most dependent on swallowing ability, and the swallowing score increased by 2.3 units in the AT group, 1.8 units in the AT/RT group, and 1.4 units in the L/RT group (p = not significant). Adding RT to laser therapy significantly increased time in treatment (mean, 38.7 days) when compared with the AT group (mean, 12.5 days) (p less than 0.001). However, only 1 patient required repeat laser ablation. It is concluded that AT and L/RT result in good palliation as measured by relief of dysphagia and survival time. However, morbidity of AT is significantly greater than that of L/RT. Laser and radiation therapy with a reduced total dosage of RT or with a change in fractionation schedule to limit treatment time is the preferred method of palliation.",382,1
"Deficient counterregulatory hormone responses during hypoglycemia in a patient with insulinoma. Counterregulatory hormone responses were evaluated in a 37-yr-old woman before and after removal of a benign insulin-producing islet cell tumor. Counterregulatory hormone concentrations were measured during a glucose clamp with graded reductions of plasma glucose from 5.2 to 2.6 mmol/L. In the study before surgery, the increase in plasma epinephrine concentration was markedly blunted (by greater than 90%) compared to that in the study after surgery. The peak plasma norepinephrine concentration was similarly reduced by 71%, and plasma cortisol by 63%. In addition, the glycemic thresholds for secretion of the counterregulatory hormones were lower before removal of the tumor. Peak plasma GH responses were equivalent before and after surgery, but the threshold for GH secretion was 21% lower in the first hypoglycemia study. We conclude 1) that there is evidence for abnormal glucose counterregulatory hormone secretion in this patient, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypoglycemia seen in patients with insulinoma; 2) the reversal of reduced counterregulatory hormone secretion after tumor resection suggests that these defective hormonal responses may be related to recurrent hypoglycemia, persistent hyperinsulinemia, or both; and 3) that abnormal glucose counterregulation may exist in the absence of type 1 diabetes.",282,1
"Response to suxamethonium in a myasthenic patient during remission. A cumulative dose followed by an infusion was used to determine the dose response to suxamethonium in a patient with diagnosed myasthenia gravis who was in true remission (asymptomatic while receiving no therapy). The ED50 and ED90 values for suxamethonium were 0.08 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg, and an infusion rate of 3.2 mg/kg/hour was required to maintain a 90-95% depression of the single twitch response as monitored by integrated electromyography. These values are within the range for normal patients, and we conclude that myasthenic patients during a true remission may not demonstrate resistance to suxamethonium.",170,0
"Expression of beta 1 integrins in normal human keratinocytes. The majority of cell adhesive events to the extracellular matrix are mediated by cell surface receptors, beta 1 integrins. Keratinocytes express at least six different polypeptides of beta 1 integrin class, namely beta 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 (alpha 6 is mainly associated with beta 4 polypeptide). These epithelial cells use alpha 2 beta 1 as a collagen receptor and alpha 3 beta 1 as a fibronectin receptor, while alpha 6 beta 4 is the major basement membrane receptor. Expression of alpha 5 beta 1 complex is low. Processing of beta 1 integrins is fast in keratinocytes; half-maximal maturation takes only 3 hours. In addition to their function in cell-matrix interactions, beta 1 integrins (alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 3 beta 1) have also a role in maintaining keratinocyte cell-cell interactions. It is possible that resting basal keratinocytes use beta 1 integrins as cell-cell adhesion receptors, and during activation, like in wound healing, these receptors relocalize to mediate events involving cell-matrix interactions.",253,1
"Long-term amiodarone administration protects against global myocardial ischemia. Reports on the effects of amiodarone on cardiac function have been variable. This study addresses the effect of long-term amiodarone administration on recovery of cardiac function after a period of global ischemia. Normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats were used. Normotensive rats (n = 6) received 240 mg/kg amiodarone for 4 weeks, for a total of 72 +/- 3 mg. Hypertensive rats (n = 6) received 500 mg/kg amiodarone for 4 weeks, for a total of 116 +/- 5 mg. Final myocardial concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone were 1.85 +/- 1.75 and 0.50 +/- 0.61 micrograms/g wet weight for the normotensive rats and 1.30 +/- 0.58 and 0.31 +/- 0.17 micrograms/g for the hypertensive rats (p = nonsignificant). Equal numbers of controls received sterile saline solution for 4 weeks. The hearts were excised and perfused in a Langendorff apparatus. The results indicate that, after 15 minutes of normothermic ischemia, hearts treated with this relatively low dose of amiodarone recovered a greater percentage of preischemic work (97% +/- 13%) as compared with the controls (76% +/- 17%) (p less than 0.005).",335,0
"Elective resection for diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. From 1966 to 1987, 177 consecutive patients were operated on electively for diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. The indications for surgery were: colovesical fistula (n = 12), suspicion of residual abscess (n = 39), two or more previous attacks of acute inflammation (n = 52), chronic symptoms (n = 72) and suspicion of carcinoma (n = 2). An abscess was found at operation in 76 patients (43 per cent) and this was extracolic with local peritonitis in 52 patients (29 per cent). An unsuspected abscess was found in 25 of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. Colonic resection with primary anastomosis was performed in 95 per cent of the 177 patients and in 94 per cent of those 52 patients with an extracolic abscess. There were no postoperative deaths and no clinical anastomotic leakages. Long-term results were very good in 85 per cent of the 177 patients and in 82 per cent of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. The results of this series suggest that a one-stage procedure can be safely performed with some technical precautions in most patients operated on electively for diverticular disease, even if an extracolic abscess is found. The good long-term results in patients operated on for chronic symptoms suggest that such symptoms should be taken into account with respect to surgical indications.",333,0
Malignant thymoma presenting as intracardiac tumor and superior vena caval obstruction.

"High-dose epinephrine improves outcome from pediatric cardiac arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Animal studies suggest that the standard dose of epinephrine (SDE) for treatment of cardiac arrest in human beings may be too low. We compared the outcome after SDE with that after high-dose epinephrine (HDE) in children with refractory cardiac arrest. DESIGN: Prospective intervention versus historic control groups. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Two similar groups of 20 consecutive patients each (median ages, 2.5 and 3 years) with witnessed cardiac arrest who remained in arrest after at least two SDEs (0.01 mg/kg). INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with an additional SDE versus HDE (0.2 mg/kg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rates of return of spontaneous circulation and long-term survival were compared. Fourteen of the HDE group (70%) had return of spontaneous circulation, whereas none of the SDE group did (P less than .001). Eight children survived to discharge after HDE, and three were neurologically intact at follow-up. No significant toxicity from HDE was observed. CONCLUSION: HDE provided a higher return of spontaneous circulation rate and a better long-term outcome than SDE in our series of pediatric cardiac arrest. HDE may warrant incorporation into standard resuscitation protocols at an early enough point to prevent irreversible brain injury.",283,0
"Coexpression of two fibronectin receptors, VLA-4 and VLA-5, by immature human erythroblastic precursor cells. Human erythroblastic precursor cells adhere to fibronectin (Fn) but the exact nature of the receptors mediating this interaction has not been characterized. In this study, we report data showing that immature human erythroblasts express the integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 and that both these molecules act as fibronectin receptors on these cells. We have recently demonstrated that adhesion to Fn of purified human CFU-E and their immediate progeny preproerythroblasts was inhibited by antibodies directed against the human fibronectin receptor (VLA-5). Here we have extended those results and characterized by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies the integrins expressed on surface-labeled normal human immature erythroblasts. A polyclonal antibody recognizing the common VLA beta 1 subunit yielded two polypeptides of 120 and 160 kD. Our data further demonstrate that the polypeptide of 160 kD contains alpha subunits corresponding to both alpha 4 and alpha 5. Thus, erythroblast lysates prepared in 0.3% CHAPS and immunoprecipitated with antibodies which specifically recognize the alpha 4 subunit showed a heterodimer with peptides of 120 (beta 1) and 160 kD (alpha 4) and the additional peptides of 70 and 80 kD which usually coprecipitate with the alpha 4 chain. On the other hand, specific anti-alpha 5 antibodies immunoprecipitated an alpha 5/beta 1 complex with peptides of 120 and 160 kD which under reducing conditions migrated as a single band of 130 kD. Similar experiments performed with an erythroleukemic cell line (KU 812) showed that these cells also coexpress both the VLA-4 and VLA-5 members of the integrin family. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies recognizing the VLA alpha 4 chain blocked the adhesion of immature erythroblasts to Fn-coated surfaces, thus demonstrating that, as VLA-5, VLA-4 is also a functional Fn receptor on these cells.",457,1
"Long-term effects of nimodipine on cerebral infarcts and outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery. A total of 213 patients with verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Grades I to III (Hunt and Hess classification) were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of intravenous nimodipine on delayed ischemic deterioration and computerized tomography (CT)-visualized infarcts after SAH and surgery. The administration of the drug or matching placebo was started immediately after the radiological diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm had been made. Of the 213 patients enrolled in the study, 58 were operated on early (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 69 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 74 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Eleven patients died before surgery was undertaken and one was not operated on. A follow-up examination with CT scanning, performed 1 to 3 years after the SAH (mean 1.4 years), revealed no significant differences in the overall outcome between the groups. However, nimodipine treatment was associated with a significantly lower incidence of deaths caused by delayed cerebral ischemia (p = 0.01) and significantly lower occurrence of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in the whole population (p = 0.05), especially in patients without an associated intracerebral hemorrhage on admission CT scan (p = 0.03).",320,0
"Muscle fibre type and habitual snoring. Although anatomical abnormalities of the upper airway have been recorded in some patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a muscle tone dysregulation also seems to have an important role in this disorder. Since habitual snoring is the initial stage of OSA, the structural characteristics of upper airway muscles (medium pharyngeal constrictor muscle [MPCM]) from 13 men (9 non-snorers and 4 habitual snorers) were studied. MPCM fibre structure in non-snorers was broadly similar to that in normal limb muscles, with the exception that fibre diameters were smaller for all fibre types. Compared with limb muscles, MPCM had a smaller proportion of type IIb fibres and a higher proportion of types I and IIa fibres. MPCM in habitual snorers had an abnormal distribution of fibre types (low percentage of type I and type IIb fibres and high percentage of type IIa fibres) compared with non-snorers (p less than 0.001) and the type IIa fibres were hypertrophic. No myopathic or neurogenic changes were seen. Two possible hypotheses explain the abnormal distribution of fibre types in snorers. First, a constitutionally determined reduction of slow alpha-motor neurons induces an adaptive transformation of type IIb to type IIa fibres and a hypertrophy of type IIa fibres; or, second, motor neurons change their patterns of discharge and, hence, of activation, and modify fibre-type distribution of MPCM as an adaptation to the anatomical characteristic of upper airway and habitual snoring.",322,1
"Brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic performance in 20 neurologically asymptomatic patients suffering from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age 41 [range 18-49] years) and 20 age-matched controls (mean age 38 [range 28-49] years). Patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of cerebral infarcts (20% versus 0%, p less than 0.05) and cortical (50% versus 5%, p less than 0.01) and ventricular (55% versus 15%, p less than 0.02) atrophy than controls. Accordingly, semiquantitative volumetric measurements yielded a significantly increased ventricular-to-intracranial cavity ratio in the patients (6.2 +/- 2.9% versus 4.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.01). This ratio and the cortical atrophy ratings correlated positively with disease duration (r = 0.63 and 0.54, p less than 0.05). Cognitive test performance was significantly worse in patients than in controls and was most impaired in those patients with morphologic cerebral abnormalities.",268,0
"Rectopexy is an ineffective treatment for obstructed defecation. The symptoms of obstructed defecation have been attributed to rectal intussusception, and thus rectopexy has been advocated in the surgical management. In this study, patients with obstructed defecation underwent manometry and proctography before and after rectopexy. Seventeen patients (16 females and one male, mean age 51.6 years) were studied. Eleven underwent anterior and posterior fixation of the rectum and six had posterior fixation only. Preoperatively five patients demonstrated rectoanal intussusceptions. Fifteen had significant pelvic descent. No significant change in maximum resting pressure, maximum voluntary contraction, pelvic descent, or anorectal angle was seen postoperatively. In the initial follow-up, many patients had significant amelioration of symptoms. However, on longer follow-up (mean 30.8 months) only two had long-term improvement. The remainder had a poor clinical result in spite of complete resolution of rectal intussusception. Many reported a worsening of symptoms as reflected by an increase in tenesmus and stool frequency. In the two cases with a satisfactory result, both could empty the rectum completely and demonstrated rectoanal intussusception on preoperative evacuation proctography. In those with poor results, four had complete emptying and three had rectoanal intussusception. In conclusion rectopexy is an ineffective treatment for obstructive defecation in most patients.",292,0
"Radiation necrosis of the optic chiasm, optic tract, hypothalamus, and upper pons after radiotherapy for pituitary adenoma, detected by gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: case report. A 26-year-old woman was treated for a prolactin secreting pituitary adenoma by surgery and radiotherapy (5860 rads). Fourteen months later, she developed right hemiparesis and dysarthria. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan using gadolinium contrast showed a small, enhanced lesion in the upper pons. Seven months later, she had a sudden onset of loss of vision, and radiation optic neuropathy was diagnosed. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan showed widespread gadolinium-enhanced lesions in the optic chiasm, optic tract, and hypothalamus. Magnetic resonance imaging is indispensable for the early diagnosis of radiation necrosis, which is not visualized by radiography or computed tomography.",191,1
"Surgical treatment of the retethered spinal cord after repair of lipomyelomeningocele. In a series of 75 patients with surgically treated lipomyelomeningoceles, the neurological condition of six patients deteriorated 6 months to 14 years after the operation due to repeat tethering of the spinal cord. The tethering resulted from postoperative dense adhesion between the cord and the overlying dura mater. Two of the six patients underwent conventional repeat untethering procedures, and the remaining four were successfully treated with a new surgical technique developed by the authors to prevent such dural adhesion. For this procedure, after complete untethering of the spinal cord, the lumbosacral cord is retained in the center of the dural sac by fine stay sutures between the pia mater of the conus medullaris and the ventral dura mater. In addition, the dura mater is tacked to the posterior arch which is reconstructed with bone grafts at one or two bifid vertebral levels. During a postoperative follow-up period of 1 to 3 years, no further deterioration has been observed and magnetic resonance studies have demonstrated a space filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the lumbosacral cord. The authors conclude that long-term observation, both neurological and radiological, is essential even after successful repair of a lipomyelomeningocele. This new surgical procedure can maintain a CSF bath around the lumbosacral cord, thus preventing dural adhesion. Application of this technique will hopefully be beneficial in lipomyelomeningocele patients with a high risk of cord retethering after initial repair.",326,0
"Cerebellar syndrome caused by isoniazid. Treatment of tuberculosis in a hemodialysis patient with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide resulted in the development of acute cerebellar dysfunction. This resolved rapidly following the discontinuation of isoniazid and pyrazinamide, reinstitution of isoniazid at a lower dose, and addition of pyridoxine. We discuss why we believe this syndrome was caused by isoniazid. Patients with renal failure who undergo antituberculous therapy with isoniazid should receive supplemental pyridoxine to reduce the likelihood of isoniazid-related neurotoxicity. ",127,0
"Flow cytometric determination of breast tumor heterogeneity. Flow cytometric analysis was done on the DNA content of nuclei obtained from different sites of small breast tumors. Although specimens for analysis were obtained within a few millimeters of each other, dramatic differences were occasionally observed in the DNA histograms. In a limited study involving 141 consecutive breast specimens submitted for flow cytometry, 52% (74) were found to have at least one DNA aneuploid population. In 18% of DNA aneuploid tumors, one or more specimens from areas grossly identified as tumor had no DNA aneuploid population. Because of the proposed correlation of aneuploidy with a poorer prognosis and possible responsiveness to chemotherapy, multiple sites should be assayed when flow cytometric DNA analysis is done.",156,0
"Survival and quality of life among patients receiving unproven as compared with conventional cancer therapy. BACKGROUND. Cancer treatments without proved efficacy have achieved new levels of popularity, particularly among well-educated patients. The value of these therapies is vigorously debated. METHODS. We compared the length of survival and quality of life in patients who received treatment at a prominent unorthodox cancer clinic in addition to conventional treatment and in matched control patients from an academic cancer center who received only conventional treatment. All the patients had documented extensive malignant disease associated with a predicted median survival time of less than one year. The study sample consisted of 78 pairs of patients matched according to sex, race, age, diagnosis, and time from the diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent disease, who were enrolled over a period of 3 1/2 years. Periodic follow-up (approximately every two months) continued until death. RESULTS. There was no difference between the two patient groups in length of survival. Median survival for both groups was 15 months (P = 0.22; relative risk, 1.23; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.72). Quality-of-life scores were consistently better among conventionally treated patients from enrollment on. CONCLUSIONS. For this sample of patients with extensive disease and for this particular unorthodox treatment regimen, conventional and unorthodox treatments produced similar results.",284,1
"Lipolytic factors associated with murine and human cancer cachexia. We have identified a lipolytic factor in extracts of a cachexia-inducing murine carcinoma (MAC16) that shows characteristics of an acidic peptide and appears to be composed of three fractions of apparent molecular weights corresponding to 3 kd, 1.5 kd, and 0.7 kd, as determined by exclusion chromatography. Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation. The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake. Similar lipolytic material, although in lower concentration, was also found in the MAC13 tumor extracts. These findings suggest that cachexia may arise from the enhanced expression of a lipolytic factor associated with tumor cells.",196,0
"Expression of the antimetastatic gene nm23 in human breast cancer: an association with good prognosis. The nm23 gene was identified in murine melanoma cells, in which its expression is associated with the cells' metastatic potential. Expression of nm23 has been detected in human breast tumors by means of hybridization and immunocytochemistry. We measured nm23 mRNA in 71 patients with primary breast cancer and found variable levels of nm23 expression. The nm23 gene was expressed at higher levels in well-differentiated tumors (P less than .02). There was a significant inverse relationship between nm23 expression and nodal status (P less than .02). Expression of nm23 was positively associated with longer disease-free survival and overall survival, and the relationships were significant (P less than .002 and P less than .003, respectively). This study showed that nm23 expression in human breast cancer was associated with good prognosis and a lack of lymph node metastasis and suggests that the nm23 gene product may play an important role in suppressing the metastatic phenotype.",226,1
"Which cardiac disturbances should be treated with digoxin immune Fab (ovine) antibody? Digoxin excess can produce characteristic bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, and hyperkalemia. The bradyarrhythmias, which consist of disturbances in conduction and block at the level of the atrioventricular and sinus nodes, are mediated by a direct and vagotonic effect. The vagotonic effect of excess digoxin may also result in a marked slowing of the sinus rate in the setting of severe toxicity. Digoxin increases automatic and triggered electrical activity in atrial muscle, His-Purkinje system, and ventricular muscle, which predisposes to tachycardias. Many of the tachyarrhythmias are relatively specific for the toxic effects of digoxin. Atrial tachycardias with variable atrioventricular block, accelerated junctional rhythms (especially in the setting of atrial fibrillation), and fascicular tachycardias are characteristic digoxin toxic rhythms. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments should be considered the treatment of choice for any digoxin toxic arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic compromise or the threat of hemodynamic compromise. Hyperkalemia, when due to acute severe digoxin toxicity, is also an appropriate indication for digoxin-specific Fab fragment therapy. When assessing the risk:benefit ratio for using digoxin-specific Fab fragment therapy, one needs to determine, in addition to the electrocardiographic manifestations and patient's hemodynamic status (1) the severity of toxicity, as indexed by the amount ingested and/or the serum digoxin concentration; (2) the expected time course for reversal of toxicity, which is usually determined by the status of renal function; (3) the need for digoxin to provide ventricular rate control or improved ventricular contractility and therapeutic alternatives to digoxin; (4) the presence of a strong allergy history; (5) the presence of such factors as increased age and severity of heart disease that may predispose to digoxin toxicity.",391,0
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of the placental form of glutathione S-transferase, a detoxifying enzyme in human gliomas. Expression of the human placental form of glutathion S-transferase (GST-pi) in human gliomas was investigated by immunohistochemical methods, and the result was compared with that of normal human glial cells. The gliomas in this study were composed of five benign astrocytomas (Grade 2), ten anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), and 16 glioblastomas (Grade 4). Normal human glial cells showed only a weak immunostaining response for GST-pi in the cytoplasm or some nuclear membranes. All of benign astrocytomas had diffusely weak GST-pi immunostaining, resembling that of normal glial cells. With increasing grade, gliomas showed a strongly positive reaction for GST-pi. The positive reactions were remarkable especially in the gemistocytes and giant cells in the high-grade gliomas. These results suggest that cells of gliomas have some detoxifying function and the expression of this detoxifying enzyme, GST-pi, is related to the degree of malignancy of the gliomas.",234,1
"Tropical neuromyelopathies and retroviruses: a review. Debilitating disorders of the nervous system have a relatively high prevalence in the tropics, a geographic region that is often deficient in specialists in the fields of neurology and epidemiology. During World War II, attention was called to a possible nutritional origin for most of these diseases. Recently, however, human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), formerly linked only to a rare form of leukemia (adult T cell leukemia), has been associated with a spastic paraplegia observed mostly in tropical areas and referred to as tropical spastic paraparesis. This entity is also observed in nontropical areas endemic for HTLV-I, including Japan, South America, and the southern United States. Viruses of the HTLV family are being associated increasingly with pathology in humans. The pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated tropical spastic paraparesis remains to be understood. However, future research is expected to favor a multidisciplinary approach, with exciting potential insights derived from the fields of neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize contemporary research related to the viral etiology of this clinical entity. ",242,0
"Pathological classification and follow-up of prostatic lesions initially diagnosed as ""suspicious of malignancy"". Sections from a series of prostatic specimens (n = 44) in which the initial diagnosis implied a suspicion of malignancy were reviewed and the patients followed up (group 1). The aim was to categorise the morphological appearances according to current criteria and to determine the natural history of any pre-malignant lesions within this group. A ""control"" series of patients (n = 40) in whom the primary diagnosis was benign were also reviewed and their course followed (group 2). The heterogeneity of the abnormalities in group 1 was striking. Of the 44 cases, pre-malignant lesions were seen in 8, microinvasive adenocarcinoma in 11 and lesions not now considered pre-malignant in the remaining 25. None of the 8 patients with pre-malignant lesions developed clinical evidence of carcinoma over a follow-up period of 8 to 12 years. In contrast, 3 of the 11 diagnosed on review as having microscopic invasive adenocarcinoma developed clinically evident tumour within 5 years of surgery. Of the 25 patients whose prostatic lesions were considered benign, 2 developed carcinoma 12 and 13 years after surgery. Only 1 of the 40 patients in group 2 had a pre-malignant lesion and he did not develop tumour within 10 years. However, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed incidentally in 1 patient 3 years after surgery. It was concluded that there is a need to standardise interpretation and reporting of pre-malignant lesions and microscopic foci of adenocarcinoma in the prostate. The limited results on the course of pre-malignant lesions diagnosed incidentally in patients over 60 years of age do not indicate that follow-up would have prompted the early diagnosis of invasive disease.",381,1
"Does auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation reverse hypersplenism and portal hypertension? In this study, performed to assess the effect of auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation on portal hypertension and hypersplenism, eight patients with chronic liver disease who underwent the procedure and had functioning grafts for at least 6 months were analyzed. The transplantation resulted in (a) normalization of platelet and leukocyte counts, (b) reduction of splenomegaly by 20% +/- 3% (P less than 0.02), (c) disappearance of ascites, and (d) diminution of esophageal varices in all patients. Intraoperatively, the mean portacaval pressure gradient decreased with 54% +/- 7% after recirculation of the graft (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, a functioning auxiliary heterotopic liver graft decompresses portal hypertension and reverses hypersplenism.",181,0
"The ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome. A patient developed isolated numbness, 1st confined to the lateral nose and upper lip, but later involving the cheek, lower lip, upper gingiva, and the palate. This numbness was later associated with paresis of the muscles of the upper lip and angle of the mouth and with ipsilateral lower lid droop (the ""numb cheek-limp lower lid"" syndrome). Squamous cell carcinoma was discovered infiltrating the infraorbital nerve and distal branches of the facial nerve. Cheek numbness associated with lower eyelid or upper lip weakness may herald a neoplasm affecting the infraorbital nerve and distal facial nerve branches.",132,0
"Chemical peritonitis secondary to intraperitoneal vancomycin. Although previously reported in the literature, the existence of chemical peritonitis due to vancomycin in patients on peritoneal dialysis remains controversial. We report four similar episodes of sterile peritonitis in three patients receiving intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin. The prior report implicated a change in the brand of vancomycin preparation, from Vancocin to Vancoled, as a contributing factor. We noted the occurrence of such episodes following a switch from Vancocin to a generic preparation from Abbott Laboratories. High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) profiles of the three preparations show Vancocin to have a lower level of impurities than the other two; the presence of certain contaminants in the other brands may be contributing to the clinical difference observed. We conclude that chemical peritonitis due to IP vancomycin administration does occur, and that increased awareness of this entity could allow other cases to be identified. ",189,0
Retroperitoneal fibrosis after surgery for aortic aneurysm in a patient with periarteritis nodosa: successful treatment with corticosteroids. A 54-year-old man with hepatitis B virus-related periarteritis nodosa developed retroperitoneal fibrosis with bilateral hydronephrosis 2.5 months after placement of an aortobifemoral prosthesis for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Retroperitoneal fibrosis disappeared after treatment with corticosteroids. This observation is interesting in the light of the hypothesis that retroperitoneal fibrosis is caused by vasculitis.,106,0
"Interphase cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders. Cytogenetic information usually is obtained through the direct analysis of chromosomes from cells arrested in metaphase. Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology. ",192,1
"Dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer with emphasis on the lateral ligament. Surgical experience with carcinomas of the uterus and rectum has provided new insights into the surgical anatomy of a lamina, which separates the paravesical space from the pararectal space. It has been proved that each of the lamina consists of the cardinal and lateral ligaments and pelvic splanchnic nerves, descending in the following order. The cardinal and lateral ligaments, as a connective stalk, insert into the lateral walls of the uterus and rectum extending from the inner aspect of the pelvic wall. Clarification of this structural relationship led to the development of a new procedure for the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy, while still preserving the lateral ligament. This facilitated systematic dissection of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments with posterior manipulation, leading to a reduction in blood loss and to prevention of brisk bleeding from the venous plexuses.

"The potential of 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) for the detection of tumor involvement in lymph nodes. To assess the potential of FDG for PET imaging of nodal tumor metastases, we evaluated its uptake into normal lymph nodes, tumor-involved lymph nodes, and subcutaneous tumor xenografts in rodents. Normal lymph nodes in mice and rats accumulate FDG moderately, developing node/blood ratios of 1.3-11.9/1 at 2 hr following i.v. injection. By contrast, FDG given subcutaneously to healthy Sprague Dawley rats developed very high normal draining lymph node/blood ratios (272/1) versus 7.7/1 by i.v. injection. In nude mice, subcutaneous human ovarian cancer xenografts had 1.27-fold more uptake relative to blood than did normal popliteal lymph nodes. Subcutaneous tumor xenografts of rat breast cancer developed tumor/normal node uptake ratios of 4.91 +/- 0.43/1 and tumor/blood ratios of 6.6 +/- 0.9 at 2 hr postinjection. Mouse nodes involved with 38C13 murine B-cell lymphoma had mean node/blood ratios of 42.9 +/- 6.7/1 and tumored node/normal lymph node uptake of 6.3/1. Thus, FDG given intravenously but not subcutaneusly (due to high normal nodal uptake) has potential as an agent for the detection of metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes using PET scanning.",337,1
"Frequency and clinical implications of monoclonal antibody detection of tumor-associated antigens in serum of patients with lung cancer. We previously showed that a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) (5E8, 5C7, and 1F10) that detect serum tumor-associated antigens (TAA) could distinguish patients with lung cancer from those without to a highly significant degree. However, among patients with lung cancer, the frequency and clinical importance of serum TAA expression were not established. Therefore, we analyzed the serum and initial clinical characteristics of 52 Philadelphia VA patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer seen over a 13-month period. A modified semiquantitative ELISA was employed to determine MAb reactivity. Our cohort was characterized by a mean age of 65 +/- 9 year (SD) and mean Karnovsky score of 74 +/- 10; marked weight loss was present in 28 subjects, and 39 presented with either Stage III or IV disease. The panel detected TAAs in 38 of 52 cases (sensitivity 73%; 95% Cl, 60-83%), including 13 of 22 squamous cell, 9 of 12 adenocarcinoma, 10 of 11 undifferentiated, and 6 of 7 small cell carcinomas. No significant differences were found between the reactive and nonreactive patients in terms of age, stage at presentation, histologic subtype, performance status, or weight loss. However, 1F10 and 5C7 were each associated with a greater risk of early death by Cox proportional hazard analysis (p = 0.017 and 0.006, respectively) even when other prognostic variables are accounted for. We conclude that specific serum TAA can be detected in the majority of lung cancer patients with all major histologic subtypes in a cohort with advanced tumors and poor prognostic indices.",396,1

"Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in motor neuron disease and neuropathy. We found anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in 23% of 56 patients with motor neuron disease (MND), in 19% of 69 patients with neuropathy, and in 7% of 107 controls with other neurologic and nonneurologic diseases. Most of these patients had anti-GM1 IgM antibody titers of 1:80 or less; slightly higher antibody titers (up to 1:640) were found in 3 patients, 1 with MND and 2 with neuropathy, and very high titers (1:20,480) in a patient with MND and an IgM kappa M protein that reacted with GM1, GD1b, and asialo GM1. Six other patients with anti-GM1 IgM that also bound to GD1b. Reactivity with GD1b did not correlate with anti-GM1 titers but was only present in patients with MND or neuropathy. Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies may be a normal constituent of the human antibody repertoire but their frequency and, in some cases, their levels are higher in patients with MND and neuropathy. The origin and the pathogenetic role of these antibodies in neural impairment remain to be established.",271,0
"Multimodality preoperative treatment for advanced stage IV (MO) cancer of the head and neck. Sixty-three patients with advanced unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. We observed a 75% response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The 5-year survival rate for all 63 patients was 20%, and only 3 patients were alive at 8 years. The 5-year survival rate for patients who completed the treatment plan and received chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery was 43% compared with 20% for those who had chemotherapy and radiation but refused surgery. Development of a second primary cancer was the cause of death in 62% of the patients who survived more than 24 months.",166,1
"Vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids and the risk of cancer. Low intake of vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids is consistently associated with increased risk of lung cancer in both prospective and retrospective studies. In addition, low levels of beta-carotene in serum or plasma are consistently associated with the subsequent development of lung cancer. The simplest explanation is that beta-carotene is protective. Since retinol (preformed vitamin A) is not related in a similar manner to lung cancer risk, beta-carotene appears to function through a mechanism that does not require conversion into vitamin A. However, the importance of other carotenoids and other constituents of vegetables and fruit has not been adequately explored. Both prospective and retrospective studies suggest that vegetable and fruit intake may reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, and cervix. But because of fewer studies and less consistency among studies, the epidemiologic evidence is at present less persuasive than for lung cancer. ",201,1
"Cerebrospinal norepinephrine concentrations and the duration of epidural analgesia This study was performed to determine whether the addition of norepinephrine to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia in man. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured. In the first part of the study, epidural catheters were inserted in 14 patients before herniotomy. Mepivacaine, 1.5 per cent (0.35 ml.kg-1), was administered and norepinephrine (5 micrograms.ml-1) was added in seven patients. The duration of anaesthesia was prolonged from 54 +/- 11 min to 83 +/- 12 min (P less than 0.05) and CSF NE concentrations increased from 68 +/- 12 pg.ml-1 to 336 +/- 85 pg.ml-1 in the NE group (P less than 0.01). In the second part, eight patients with herpetic neuralgia received epidural analgesia at the fourth to eighth thoracic interspace, using bupivacaine 0.25 per cent, with and without NE. The CSF NE concentrations in this group were greater than in the surgical patients before operation and increased from 254 +/- 58 to 406 +/- 58 pg.ml-1 30 min after administration of bupivacaine with NE. The duration of pain relief was prolonged with NE. These results suggest that adding NE to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia. Moreover, NE concentrations in surgical patients increased to levels similar to those found in patients suffering from herpetic analgesia. This suggests that the increase of CSF NE in chronic pain states has an antinociceptive effect.",374,0

"Methodology of mental stress testing in cardiovascular research. Many issues related to the selection, reliability, and validity of mental stress testing in cardiovascular research are discussed. Five categories of mental stress testing are distinguished: problem-solving tasks, information-processing tasks, psychomotor tasks, affective conditions, and aversive or painful conditions. A series of practical and theoretical criteria are outlined for the selection of appropriate tests, and the measurement of a range of dependent variables is emphasized. The temporal stability of cardiovascular responses to mental stress tests is examined through an analysis of test-retest correlations (weighted for sample size) in 28 comparisons with intervals between sessions varying from 1 day to more than 1 year. Heart rate reactions to tasks show an average-weighted Z of 0.732 +/- 0.031 (r = 0.62), with Z = 0.575 +/- 0.034 (r = 0.52) for systolic blood pressure and Z = 0.313 +/- 0.035 (r = 0.30) for diastolic blood pressure. It is argued that the validity of mental stress tests can be judged in relation to several different aspects, specifically, methodological, ecological, diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic validities. The nature of these standards is described, and pertinent literature is presented.",282,0

"The association of selected cancers with service in the US military in Vietnam. III. Hodgkin's disease, nasal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and primary liver cancer. The Selected Cancers Cooperative Study Group As part of a series of investigations into the health of Vietnam veterans, we conducted case-control studies involving 310 men with Hodgkin's disease, 48 with nasal carcinoma, 80 with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 130 with primary liver cancer, and 1776 controls between 1984 and 1988. All men born between 1929 and 1953 and diagnosed in an area covered by eight cancer registries were considered eligible as cases; controls were recruited by random-digit dialing. Whereas the study had excellent power (96%) to detect a twofold increase in risk for Hodgkin's disease among Vietnam veterans, its ability to detect a similarly elevated risk in the other cancers was limited, ranging from 38% (nasal carcinoma) to 75% (primary liver cancer). Analyses showed that risks among Vietnam veterans relative to other men were 1.1 (Hodgkin's disease), 0.7 (nasal carcinoma), 0.5 (nasopharyngeal carcinoma), and 1.2 (primary liver cancer). None of these relative risks was significantly different from 1.0. Similar results were obtained if Vietnam veterans were compared with (1) other veterans or (2) men who never served in the military. An examination of several attributes of military service in Vietnam (eg, branch, duration of service, and other characteristics that may have been associated with the use of Agent Orange) failed to identify any groups of veterans who were at increased risk for Hodgkin's disease. Small numbers limited further analyses of nasal, nasopharyngeal, and liver cancer. These results provide no evidence that, 15 to 25 years following service in Vietnam, the risk of these malignant neoplasms is higher among veterans.",416,1
"Principles of treatment of pediatric solid tumors. Great strides have been made in the treatment of pediatric solid tumors over the last three decades.

"Cathepsins D and E in normal, metaplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous gastric tissue: an immunohistochemical study. Immunohistochemical distributions of cathepsins D and E were determined in normal mucosa, metaplastic, dysplastic, and cancerous lesions of the human stomach. Cathepsins D and E were localised in the foveolar epithelium and parietal cells of the normal gastric mucosa, but their intracytoplasmic distributions were different - cathepsin E distribution was even and diffuse in the cytoplasm while cathepsin D was found in coarse intracytoplasmic granules. Chronic inflammation and ulcer did not influence the distribution of these enzymes. No positive staining was obtained in the incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumour cells of signet ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, however, gave strong and diffuse stainings for cathepsins D and E in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that the distribution of cathepsins D and E is related to each specialised function of the foveolar epithelium and the parietal cells, and that their disappearance is associated with development of well differentiated adenocarcinoma from intestinal metaplasia.

"Paradoxical embolism: an underestimated entity. A plea for comprehensive work-up. Forty-one cases of arterial embolism were reviewed. The work-up included M + 2D echocardiography in 29 patients (71%), arteriography in 22 (54%), both echocardiography and arteriography in 19 (46%), and abdominal aortic ultrasound in 18 (43%). The sources of emboli were probable cardiac (8 = 20%)--mural cardiac thrombus detected by echocardiogram; possible cardiac (12 = 29%)--arrhythmias or other cardiac pathology detected without mural thrombus; probable arterio-arterial (7 = 17%)--proximal arterial thrombus detected; probable paradoxical embolism (2 = 5%)--fulfills the Johnson criteria with cardiac defect and right-to-left shunt detected by contrast echo in one patient and cardiac catheterization in the other; possible paradoxical embolism (3 = 7%)--meets two of three Johnson criteria without evidence of other source; and unknown source (9 = 22%)--conventional work-up negative or incomplete. Five of nine patients (56%) less than 50 years old had probable or possible paradoxical embolism, while in two patients (22%), the origin was unknown. Conclusion: (1) A significant proportion of patients with an arterial embolus are discharged with the source of emboli unknown, (2) paradoxical embolism must be considered and contrast saline or transesophageal echocardiogram should be done in patients under 50 years old.",324,0
"Carotid artery disease in patients with head and neck carcinoma. Irradiation has been shown experimentally to cause accelerated development of atherosclerosis in exposed large arteries. However, occurrence of such an entity in carotid arteries of patients after treatment for head and neck carcinoma is unknown. Therefore, we reviewed 179 patient charts who had undergone head and neck operations with or without irradiation between 1979-1987. Of these 179 patients, 107 (59.8%) were dead at time of follow-up. Cause of death was unknown in 42 (40%) patients; in the remainder included: respiratory arrest--33; carcinoma-related--18; cardiac--6;pneumonia--7; and trauma--1. Average interval from treatment to death was 23.5 months. Of the 72 patients known to be alive, follow-up was obtained in 52 patients. Their average age was 64.9 years. Risk factors for atherosclerosis included: male gender--43; smoking--50; hypertension--9; diabetes--4; coronary artery disease--12; and peripheral vascular disease--4. Seventy-five per cent of these patients received postoperative irradiation. Average follow-up was 64.5 months. Duplex scans were performed on 34 patients. Three patients had common or internal carotid stenoses greater than 75 per cent. All of these patients had received irradiation and none of them were symptomatic. Seven patients had carotid stenoses between 50 to 75 per cent; five of these had received irradiation. Of these five patients, one had a stroke 60 months postoperatively, and one had a TIA 36 months postoperatively. The remaining 58 patients (of which 48 had irradiation) had carotid stenoses less than 50 per cent and none were symptomatic.",396,1
"Correlation between hyperthermoradiosensitivity and clinical effect in carcinoma of the esophagus. The correlation between hyperthermoradiosensitivity evaluated by an in vitro succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (SDI) test and the histopathologic effects of hyperthermochemoradiotherapy (HCR therapy) were investigated in 43 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. The succinate dehydrogenase (SD) activity of tissue fragments taken at biopsy was assayed after exposure to heat (43 degrees C.) and radiation (6 grays) was done. The sensitivity to radiation plus heat treatment was estimated by the percentage of SD activity of the treated cells, compared with that of the control cells. The 43 patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of SD activity after exposure to radiation plus heat treatment. The SD activity was less than 50 per cent in group 1 (highly sensitive), between 50 and 70 per cent in group 2 (moderately sensitive), more than 70 per cent in group 3 (less sensitive). Eighteen of 20 in group 1, 11 of 17 in group 2 and two of six in group 3 were classified as being histopathologically ""effective"" for HCR therapy. The two year survival rate for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 55.5, 34.9 and zero per cent, respectively, while there were no statistical differences with regard to prognostic factors. These data suggest that in vitro activities of SD correlate well with the clinical effectiveness of HCR therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that a SD inhibition test be included among the guidelines for clinical management.",341,1
"Pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation of vascular complications. Transplantation of the pancreas is an increasingly common therapeutic option for preventing or delaying complications of type I diabetes mellitus. The authors studied the relative roles of various radiologic examinations in diagnosing vascular complications in these grafts including arterial and venous thrombosis, stenosis, and anastomotic leak (the most common vascular factors that necessitate pancreatectomy of the transplant), as defined with pathologic or arteriographic data. The results of 78 scintigraphic flow studies, 40 abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic (CT) scans, 27 sonograms, and eight color Doppler studies were evaluated in 52 patients who received a total of 27 cadaveric and 26 living-donor grafts over a 12-year period. These results were correlated with the data from 45 gross and microscopic pathologic studies and 37 arteriograms to determine their relative value in enabling detection of graft thrombosis and other vascular complications. Scintigraphy, CT, sonography, and color Doppler were all sensitive in detection of generalized graft abnormalities but lacked specificity in defining the underlying etiologic factors.",233,0
"Diagnostic imaging and surgical treatment of dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. We describe the diagnostic procedures and surgical approaches employed in 5 patients with dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately described the existence and longitudinal extension of the intraspinal component of the tumor and assisted in choosing the appropriate surgical approach. Both the intrathoracic and intraspinal components of the tumor were resected at one time by a thoracic and neurosurgical team. We employed the Grillo technique three times and a separate laminectomy and thoracotomy approach. Magnetic resonance imaging proved the most useful diagnostic technique for suspected dumbbell mediastinal tumors. In our experience, the extended thoracotomy proposed by Grillo and co-workers worked well for small tumors involving only one foramen in which the intraspinal extension was limited to 2 to 3 cm, and when no more than two laminectomies were required. On the other hand, thoracotomy and a longitudinal paravertebral incision are preferable for larger tumors (more than 4 cm) involving more than one foramen in which the intraspinal extension exceeds 2 to 3 cm, for tumors requiring multiple laminectomy, and when bony infiltration is present.",245,0
"Antibodies to synthetic peptide (125-148) of the alpha-subunit of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in sera from patients with myasthenia gravis. We measured the amount of antibodies to a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the alpha-subunit residues Lys125-Thr148 of human acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in myasthenic sera. We detected anti-peptide antibodies in 52% (89/171) of the patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), but none in any of the healthy controls. Anti-peptide antibodies should provide a valuable immunologic parameter for the clinical evaluation of MG, but no apparent correlation was observed between the titers of anti-peptide and anti-AChR antibodies.",162,1
"Does auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation reverse hypersplenism and portal hypertension? In this study, performed to assess the effect of auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation on portal hypertension and hypersplenism, eight patients with chronic liver disease who underwent the procedure and had functioning grafts for at least 6 months were analyzed. The transplantation resulted in (a) normalization of platelet and leukocyte counts, (b) reduction of splenomegaly by 20% +/- 3% (P less than 0.02), (c) disappearance of ascites, and (d) diminution of esophageal varices in all patients. Intraoperatively, the mean portacaval pressure gradient decreased with 54% +/- 7% after recirculation of the graft (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, a functioning auxiliary heterotopic liver graft decompresses portal hypertension and reverses hypersplenism.",181,0
"Nosocomial outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients. OBJECTIVE--To describe a nosocomial outbreak of cryptosporidiosis during four months after June 1989. SETTING--A department of infectious diseases in Copenhagen, seeing about half the patients with AIDS in Denmark. SUBJECTS--73 HIV antibody negative subjects and 60 antibody positive subjects admitted as inpatients during the transmission period of the outbreak (20 June-14 August), of whom 18 (17 with AIDS, one with AIDS related complex), developed cryptosporidiosis. Two further HIV negative subjects (one departmental secretary, one visiting relative) developed cryptosporidiosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cryptosporidia in stool samples, clinical symptoms, CD4 cell count, HIV antigen concentration, chemotherapeutic treatment. RESULTS--The source of the outbreak was identified as ice from an ice machine in the ward, contaminated by an incontinent, psychotic patient with cryptosporidiosis picking out ice for cold drinks. The mean incubation time was at least 13 days-that is, twice that in HIV-negative patients. Of the 18 patients with AIDS who developed cryptosporidiosis, five recovered, two were symptomless carriers, three died of unrelated causes, and eight died after prolonged diarrhoea. Among the 57 exposed HIV antibody positive inpatients (excluding two patients and the index case with cryptosporidiosis diagnosed elsewhere), significantly more of those who developed symptomatic cryptosporidiosis received oral sulphonamides than those who did not (91%, 10/11 v 48%, 21/44, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--The clinical and epidemiological findings indicate that infection was the consequence of very small inocula. Increased sensitivity to cryptosporidiosis may be an unrecognised side effect of oral sulphonamide treatment in patients with AIDS.",392,0
"A clinical and flow cytometric analysis of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer. Abnormal cellular DNA content, a hallmark of malignancy, is known to be an important prognostic factor in many human solid tumors; however, no data have been published on whether cellular DNA content carries prognostic significance for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pathology specimens representing pretreatment tissue biopsies from 55 patients (41 men and 14 women) with NPC were analyzed for cellular DNA content in a retrospective fashion from 1968 to 1988. Individual tumors were classified as either lymphoepithelioma, squamous cell, or anaplastic carcinoma, and were staged according to International Union Against Cancer (UICC) criteria. All patients were treated with curative intent using a 4 to 6 MeV linear accelerator to total doses ranging from 50 to 60 Gy in 4 to 6 weeks. The overall 5-year actuarial survival for all 55 patients was 44.4% (men, 41%; women, 52%). Survival by T stage was as follows: T1, 65%; T2, 51%; T3, 36%; and T4, 27%. Similarly, the 5-year survival rate declined as the bulk of nodal metastases increased: N0, 62%; N2, 50%; N3, 37%; and N1, 25%. Patients who had anaplastic carcinoma had a 5-year survival of 73%, those with lymphoepithelioma had a 60% survival, and those with squamous cell cancer (SCC) had a 30% survival. There was a statistically significant difference in 5-year survival between patients with SCC and those with nonkeratinizing histologies (P less than 0.05). In addition, there was a significant association between patients older than 40 years of age with SCC and patients younger than 40 years of age with nonkeratinizing malignancies (P less than 0.01). Of the 55 tumors successfully analyzed, 22 (40%) were diploid and 33 (60%) were aneuploid. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) of all 55 samples was 6.17%. There was no significant difference in 5-year survival between patients with diploid and those with aneuploid tumors (48% versus 42%). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant survival difference between aneuploid and diploid tumors within any one histologic subgroup. There was also no significant survival difference related to the DNA index. The results indicate that the extent of local tumor spread is still the most important prognostic factor for patients treated with radiotherapy for NPC. The data support the conclusion that patients with lymphoepithelioma and anaplastic carcinomas have a superior survival to patients with squamous cell carcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",626,1
"Conjugates of ursodeoxycholate protect against cholestasis and hepatocellular necrosis caused by more hydrophobic bile salts. In vivo studies in the rat. The protective effect of ursodeoxycholate conjugates against bile salt hepatotoxicity was studied in chronic bile fistula rats. Taurochenodeoxycholate or taurodeoxycholate, infused intraduodenally at 24 or 16 mumols/100 g rat per hour, respectively, caused cholestasis and severe hepatocellular necrosis within 8 hours. In contrast, tauroursodeoxycholate or taurocholate at 48 mumols/100 g rat per hour were choleretic. Tauroursodeoxycholate was not hepatotoxic, whereas taurocholate produced moderate hepatocellular necrosis. Simultaneous infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate to rats receiving taurochenoxycholate or taurodeoxycholate preserved bile flow and ameliorated hepatic injury in a dose-dependent manner. Tauroursodeoxycholate protected equally by intravenous and intraduodenal routes. Intravenous glycoursodeoxycholate also was protective. The hydrophobicity index of infused bile salts correlated well with their toxicity. Concurrent administration of ursodeoxycholate conjugates did not reduce biliary recovery of intraduodenally infused [24-14C]-taurocholate. Biliary alkaline phosphatase secretion was stimulated by infusion of taurocholate, taurodeoxycholate, or taurochenodeoxycholate; simultaneous infusion of ursodeoxycholate conjugates failed to prevent this increase. We conclude that ursodeoxycholate counteracts hepatoxicity of more hydrophobic bile salts via a direct effect at the level of the liver.",354,0
"Surgical presentation of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). Five patients with Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) are reported whose varied presentations included acute abdominal pain, peripheral arterial aneurysms, digital gangrene and sterile pyuria and whose presenting pathology ranged from hydrops of the gallbladder to enteric pseudo-obstruction. As the complications of the disease can usually be managed without resort to surgery, which is associated with a mortality rate of up to 25 per cent, the recognition of Kawasaki disease will prevent hazardous and unnecessary laparotomy.",113,0

"A 170-kDa membrane-bound protease is associated with the expression of invasiveness by human malignant melanoma cells. Malignant spreading of cancer cells requires cell surface proteases that cleave the crosslinked collagenous matrix of connective tissues. From correlating the morphologically defined invasiveness of tumor cells with the presence of specific membrane-associated proteases, we have identified a malignant human melanoma cell line, LOX, that invades crosslinked gelatin films in vitro and contains uniquely a neutral 170-kDa gelatinase in the cell membrane. A similar gelatinase was found in membranes recovered from culture media conditioned with LOX. The 170-kDa gelatinase is a wheat germ agglutinin-binding protein. The proteolytic activity is maximal at neutral pH, enhanced by EDTA and dithiothreitol, inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide, HgCl2, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and can bind to an organomercurial adsorbent, suggesting that it is a neutral sulfhydryl-sensitive protease. This 170-kDa gelatinase of LOX cells was not found in a control melanoma cell line, SK-MEL28, or in 32 other tumor cell lines that did not show extracellular gelatin degradation. Thus, we have identified a large membrane-bound protease that may be a specific marker molecule for melanoma cell invasiveness.",291,1
"Decreased operative risk of surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation with or without coronary artery disease. The consecutive 2 year experience with patients undergoing first-time surgery for mitral regurgitation with and without coronary artery disease was reviewed. From January 1988 to January 1990, 127 patients with pure mitral regurgitation undergoing first-time operation were surgically treated. No other valve lesion, no reoperation and no congenital defects were included. The mean patient age was 62 years with 26% of the patients greater than 70 years. Twenty-six percent of the entire group was in functional class IV. Seventy-five patients received mitral valve repair and 52 underwent mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude or Hancock valve. In patients undergoing mitral valve repair, there was a higher incidence of those greater than 70 years old and of coronary artery disease and in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement there was a higher incidence of functional class IV. The operative mortality rate was 2.3% (3 of 127 patients). No patient failed to be discontinued from cardiopulmonary bypass and all three deaths occurred after mitral valve replacement, with one from complications of chronic renal failure and dialysis. There was no significant difference in patients who either did or did not have a concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and there was no difference related to age or functional class. Postoperative complications occurred in five patients in the valve repair group, including recurrent mitral regurgitation in two necessitating reoperation, and in three patients in the valve replacement group. With newer operative and postoperative management techniques, especially preservation of the papillary muscle annular continuity, the risk of mitral valve surgery, particularly of valve repair, is considerably lower than in previous years.",355,0
"Rupture of atheromatous plaque as a cause of thrombotic occlusion of stenotic internal carotid artery. We analyzed the clinical profiles and autopsy findings of five patients who died shortly after developing cerebral infarction following thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In all five cases, thrombotic occlusion was caused by rupture of the fibrous lining over the gruel of atheroma at the origin of the internal carotid artery showing tight stenosis of the lumen. The mean +/- SD shorter diameter of the lumen at the site of occlusion was 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm. Our results show that an internal carotid artery with tight stenosis of the lumen by atheroma containing gruel harbors a risk of thrombotic occlusion, which may give rise to cerebral infarction by artery-to-artery embolism or by reduced cerebral perfusion.",166,0
"A phase I clinical trial of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine in pediatric patients with acute leukemia. To evaluate its toxicity and clinical efficacy in children with relapsed or refractory leukemia, we performed a phase I trial of 2-chloro-2'-deoxy-adenosine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-CDA) given as a continuous 5-day infusion at doses of 3 to 10.7 mg/m2/d. In this study of 31 children with acute leukemia, the only dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. At the highest dose level, three of seven patients developed fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. At dose levels above 6.2 mg/m2/d, significant oncolytic responses occurred in all patients. In addition, there was a significant correlation between both the responsiveness by cell type and dose of 2-CDA, such that more oncolytic responses were noted in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (P = .02). Although this was a phase I trial in heavily pretreated patients with refractory disease, two AML patients treated at 5.2 and 10.7 mg/m2/d, respectively, had complete hematologic responses, and one patient treated at 10.7 mg/m2/d had a partial response. In addition, there was a dose-response relationship in all patients with improved cytoreduction of peripheral blast cells at higher doses of 2-CDA. In vitro evaluation of 2-CDA uptake and anabolism by leukemic blast cells from 22 patients demonstrated that 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (Cld-AMP) and 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-striphosphate (CldATP) reached concentrations close to steady-state levels within 1 hour. Intracellular nucleotide disappearance rates were high with half-lives of 1.29 and 2.47 hours for CldAMP and CldATP, respectively. This suggests that continuous infusion is necessary to maintain the desired plasma concentration. The results of this study confirm the antileukemic activity of 2-CDA and the lack of prohibitive nonhematologic toxicity. Phase II trials in patients with AML and ALL are warranted.",479,1
"Preventive therapy of first gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis: results of a controlled trial comparing propranolol, endoscopic sclerotherapy and placebo. Propranolol and endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices are the two approaches currently used in prophylaxis of the first gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the cirrhotic patient. One hundred twenty-six cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and no histories of bleeding were included in the trial regardless of the gravity of the cirrhosis or the size of the esophageal varices. Patients with hepatocarcinomas or other cancers, clearly impossible follow-up, previous treatment for portal hypertension or contraindication to beta-blockers were excluded. After randomization, 43 patients received propranolol twice daily at a dose reducing the heart rate by 25%; 42 patients were treated with intravariceal and extravariceal injections of Polidocanol; 41 control patients received vitamin K orally as placebo. The patients were seen at 3-mo intervals for 2 yr. On entry to the trial the three groups were comparable in terms of clinical and biological parameters, including size of esophageal varices (grade I = 51, grade II = 54, grade III = 17), Child-Pugh classification (A = 29, B = 61, C = 32) and the origin of cirrhosis (alcoholic in 79% of cases). Twenty-four patients bled (two bled in the propranolol group, nine bled in the endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices group and 13 bled in the placebo group). Actuarial estimates (Kaplan-Meier) of the time of onset of first bleeding showed that the differences were significant between propranolol and placebo (p less than 0.004) and between propranolol and sclerotherapy (p less than 0.03) but not between sclerotherapy and placebo.",395,0
The modified Schollner costoplasty. The modified Schollner costoplasty is a cosmetic procedure for the correction of rib prominence deformity in scoliosis. We present the results of the procedure in 21 patients who had previously undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis. We found the procedure to be well tolerated without major complications. Objective cosmetic improvement was achieved in all but one case. All but one patient considered the procedure to have been of cosmetic benefit.,90,0
"Carboplatin in childhood brain tumors. A Children's Cancer Study Group Phase II trial. Between October 1985 and March 1988, Children's Cancer Study Group institutions entered 95 patients with recurrent brain tumors into a Phase II trial of carboplatin 560 mg/m2 every 4 weeks. Complete or partial responses were observed for one of 19 evaluable children with brainstem glioma, two of 14 with ependymoma, six of 19 with medulloblastoma or central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), and none of 15 with high-grade astrocytoma. Of 33 children with medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or central nervous system PNET, five of 12 with no prior cisplatin exposure had responses, and two of 21 with prior cisplatin exposure had responses (P = 0.03). Thirty-four percent of patients had absolute neutrophil count nadirs less than 500/microliters, and 37% had platelet count nadirs less than 25,000/microliters. Sixteen percent had moderate to severe otoxicity, 10% had nausea and vomiting, and none had nephrotoxicity.",271,1
"Intestinal permeability in patients with chronic urticaria-angioedema with and without arthralgia. We evaluated the clinical response to oligoallergenic dietary treatment and the intestinal absorption of a protein antigen, cow milk beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) in 24 patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema syndrome 13 of whom also suffered from joint symptoms. Sixteen patients (77% of those with arthralgia) responded to diet (RD) with marked reduction of symptoms; the others did not respond (NR). Ten (all but one RD with arthralgia) had increased permeability to BLG after oral administration of cow milk. Four with high titers of IgG to BLG showed the highest absorption of BLG and the groups with arthralgia showed higher BLG levels than those without arthralgia. In all cases, specific IgE to cow milk was absent. These data suggest that the symptoms of a subgroup of patients with chronic urticaria, and especially patients with joint complaints that subside with diet, are related to excess intestinal permeability. The measurement of gut permeability to food proteins may be useful to define those who may benefit from dietary restriction.",238,0
"T-lymphocytic leukemia expresses complex, branched O-linked oligosaccharides on a major sialoglycoprotein, leukosialin. Leukocytes express a major sialoglycoprotein, leukosialin, of which the apparent molecular weight (mol wt) can be variable according to the differences in O-glycans attached to this molecule. In the present study, we analyzed the structures of O-glycans attached to leukosialin present in various T-lymphocytic leukemia cells. T-lymphoid cells from patients with acute T-lymphocytic leukemia express a large amount of the branched hexasaccharides, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6)GalNAc, which are also expressed in activated normal T lymphocytes, but that are almost absent in resting normal T lymphocytes. T-lymphoid cells from patients with chronic T-lymphocytic leukemia, on the other hand, mainly express the tetrasaccharides NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----6)GalNAc on leukosialin, but they also express a small significant amount of the hexasaccharides. The same hexasaccharides can be detected in thymocytes. The increased amount of the hexasaccharides in acute leukemia is associated with increased activity of beta 1----6 GlcNAc-transferase, a key enzyme in forming the hexasaccharides. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates showed that monoclonal antibody (MoAb) T-305 reacts preferentially with leukosialin of high mol wt containing the hexasaccharides. These findings indicate that T-lymphocytic leukemia cells reexpress the oligosaccharides present in immature cells.",380,1
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of the placental form of glutathione S-transferase, a detoxifying enzyme in human gliomas. Expression of the human placental form of glutathion S-transferase (GST-pi) in human gliomas was investigated by immunohistochemical methods, and the result was compared with that of normal human glial cells. The gliomas in this study were composed of five benign astrocytomas (Grade 2), ten anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), and 16 glioblastomas (Grade 4). Normal human glial cells showed only a weak immunostaining response for GST-pi in the cytoplasm or some nuclear membranes. All of benign astrocytomas had diffusely weak GST-pi immunostaining, resembling that of normal glial cells. With increasing grade, gliomas showed a strongly positive reaction for GST-pi. The positive reactions were remarkable especially in the gemistocytes and giant cells in the high-grade gliomas. These results suggest that cells of gliomas have some detoxifying function and the expression of this detoxifying enzyme, GST-pi, is related to the degree of malignancy of the gliomas.",234,1
"Characterization in vitro of a human tumor necrosis factor-binding protein. A soluble form of a tumor necrosis factor receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic mediator of inflammatory responses. A cysteine-rich, highly glycosylated 30-kD TNF-binding protein (TNF-BP) purified from urine may have a role in regulation because it protects in vitro against the biological effects of TNF. The cytotoxic effect of TNF on the fibrosarcoma cell line WEHI 164 was inhibited by 50% at a 10-fold excess of TNF-BP. The binding of TNF to the receptor was partially reversed after the addition of TNF-BP. Results from biosynthetic labeling of cells with 35S-cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TNF-BP indicated that TNF-BP is formed and released at the cell surface by cleavage because no corresponding cellular polypeptide was observed. A cellular 60-kD polypeptide, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-TNF-BP, may correspond to the transmembrane TNF-receptor molecule and be the precursor of TNF-BP. Thus, TNF-BP appears to be a soluble form of a transmembrane TNF-receptor. Moreover our results demonstrate that the production of TNF-BP is increased when the TNF receptor is downregulated in cells by treatment with TNF or by activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters. TNF-BP may be an important agent that blocks harmful effects of TNF, and, therefore, useful in clinical applications.",309,1

"Prospective study on prevalence of esophageal chest pain in patients referred on an elective basis to a cardiac unit for suspected myocardial ischemia. The prevalence of esophageal chest pain was studied prospectively in patients referred on an elective basis to a cardiac unit for suspected myocardial ischemia. A group of 248 consecutive patients without previously documented heart disease was admitted for elective diagnostic coronary angiography. The clinical history classified 185 patients as having anginal pain and the coronary angiogram was normal in 48 of them. In 37 of these 48 patients full esophageal testing was performed including 24-hr intraesophageal pH and pressure recordings with indication of chest pain episodes as well as a number of esophageal provocation tests, ie, acid perfusion, edrophonium stimulation, balloon distension, and ergonovine stimulation, all performed under continuous esophageal manometric and electrocardiographic monitoring. In 19 of these 37 patients, the familiar chest pain could be reproduced by esophageal provocative testing without ischemic ST-T segment alterations; six of these 19 patients had also a positive 24-hr pH and pressure recording. These data strongly suggest an esophageal origin of chest pain in half the patients with typical angina and a normal coronary angiogram.",254,0
"Experimental intravesical therapy for superficial transitional cell carcinoma in a rat bladder tumor model. A rodent bladder cancer model that is induced by intravesical instillation of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was characterized. Cohorts of four to five week old female Fisher 344 rats received four biweekly 1.5 mg. doses of intravesical MNU and were sacrificed at various intervals. By week 13 all animals had flat atypia and/or papillary transitional cell tumors, and 67% of the lesions were moderately (grade II) or poorly differentiated (grade III). By week 20, 83% had gross muscle invasive tumors that eventually killed the host. A cohort of 40 MNU treated animals was subsequently treated commencing at week 17 after initiation of MNU with one of three intravesical six week regimens: 1) saline; 2) BCG (Tice strain); or 3) recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (RTNF) plus adriamycin. There was no difference in animal survival or tumor growth in any group of animals commencing therapy at week 17. A second cohort of 107 animals commenced therapy at 13 weeks after initiation of MNU with one of five intravesical six week regimens: 1) intravesical BCG (Tice strain); 2) adriamycin; 3) recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (RTNF); 4) RTNF plus adriamycin; or 5) BCG plus adriamycin. BCG, RTNF or adriamycin alone had no effect on tumor growth; however, BCG plus adriamycin and RTNF plus adriamycin commencing at week 13 significantly inhibited tumor growth and progression. In conclusion, this autochthonous intravesical rodent transitional cell carcinoma model appears useful for the following reasons: 1) it closely resembles human transitional cell carcinoma histologically and biologically in that all animals develop neoplastic changes in-situ that progress to muscle invasion and kill the host; 2) as with human bladder cancer these tumors do not respond to intravesical therapy if treated when tumor burden is large; however, tumor growth is inhibited when treated early; and 3) this model appears appropriate for screening and developing new intravesical treatments for superficial bladder cancer.",476,1
"Treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with continuous intraventricular infusion of recombinant interleukin-2. A 42-year-old man developed leptomeningeal carcinomatosis 6 years after treatment of a malignant melanoma. He was treated with two courses of recombinant interleukin-2, administered as a continuous intraventricular infusion (6 X 10E5 U/24 h) during 5 days. During the first day of the first course he also received 5 X 10E9 lymphokine-activated killer cells intraventricularly. This gave rise to a severe elevation of intracranial pressure, with headaches and meningismus. During the second course no LAK cells were administered. This course was tolerated much better. The neurological status did not change during the treatment. Recombinant interleukin-2 levels were maintained at about 300 U/mL during both courses.",182,1
"Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents: theory and application to the central nervous system. The theoretical aspects of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agents are reviewed, and their current applications to the central nervous system (CNS) and their future applications are discussed. Profound differences exist between contrast agents used for MR imaging and computerized tomography (CT). In MR imaging, the contrast agents are not imaged directly but rather act on adjacent protons to shorten T1 and T2 relaxation times. This in turn results in signal intensity changes. The lanthanide metal, gadolinium, in the form of gadopentetate dimeglumine, has been found to be both safe and efficacious as the only currently approved contrast agent for MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging revolutionized the detection and treatment of disease affecting the brain and spine. Initially, it was thought that signal characteristics on MR imaging would allow differentiation of specific pathology. It was soon found that MR studies were able to detect more abnormalities but were less able to characterize them. The recent development of contrast agents for MR imaging has allowed this modality to surpass CT for the evaluation of most CNS lesions. At present, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is generally accepted as the study of choice for evaluating acoustic neurinomas, pituitary lesions, meningeal disease, primary and secondary brain tumors, active multiple sclerosis, intradural spinal neoplasms, intramedullary spinal disease, and postoperative states in both the spine and brain. Even when contrast-enhanced CT can detect the same abnormalities, evaluation of the lesions in multiple planes on MR imaging can sometimes yield invaluable information, especially prior to surgery. Future developments of contrast material for MR imaging include non-gadolinium compounds, intrathecal contrast media, cerebral blood flow and volume evaluation, and, possibly, antibody-labeled contrast agents.",362,1
"Naproxen sodium in menstrual migraine prophylaxis: a double-blind placebo controlled study. In this study, the efficacy of Naproxen sodium (Nxs) in the prophylaxis of Menstrual Migraine (MM) was tested, versus Placebo (PL). Forty women suffering from MM were admitted to a double-blind treatment protocol with Nxs 550 mg twice each day by mouth or Placebo (PL), for 3 months; in the next 3 months all the women were treated with the active drug in an open study. The headache intensity and duration, as well as the number of days of headache and the analgesic consumption, were significantly reduced with Nxs compared to PL. The efficacy of Nxs, shown also in improving premenstrual pain, and its good tolerability, support the use of this drug in the prophylactic therapy of MM.",173,0
"Neuropsychological deficits in fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects. A clinical sample of 19 school-aged native children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) was compared with age- and sex-matched normal controls. Results on a battery of intellectual and neuropsychological tests indicated large and significant differences between alcohol-affected children and controls. FAS differed significantly from controls on measures of intellectual abilities, while FAE did not; FAS mean scores on these measures were significantly lower than FAE means. For neuropsychological measures, FAS were significantly poorer than controls on most measures, while FAE showed deficits compared with controls only on grip strength. The results suggest that neuropsychological measures would be a valuable supplement to intellectual measures for the purpose of assessing alcohol effects because they are less vulnerable than intellectual measures to the influence of cultural and educational experiences.",174,0
"Pathological classification and follow-up of prostatic lesions initially diagnosed as ""suspicious of malignancy"". Sections from a series of prostatic specimens (n = 44) in which the initial diagnosis implied a suspicion of malignancy were reviewed and the patients followed up (group 1). The aim was to categorise the morphological appearances according to current criteria and to determine the natural history of any pre-malignant lesions within this group. A ""control"" series of patients (n = 40) in whom the primary diagnosis was benign were also reviewed and their course followed (group 2). The heterogeneity of the abnormalities in group 1 was striking. Of the 44 cases, pre-malignant lesions were seen in 8, microinvasive adenocarcinoma in 11 and lesions not now considered pre-malignant in the remaining 25. None of the 8 patients with pre-malignant lesions developed clinical evidence of carcinoma over a follow-up period of 8 to 12 years. In contrast, 3 of the 11 diagnosed on review as having microscopic invasive adenocarcinoma developed clinically evident tumour within 5 years of surgery. Of the 25 patients whose prostatic lesions were considered benign, 2 developed carcinoma 12 and 13 years after surgery. Only 1 of the 40 patients in group 2 had a pre-malignant lesion and he did not develop tumour within 10 years. However, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed incidentally in 1 patient 3 years after surgery. It was concluded that there is a need to standardise interpretation and reporting of pre-malignant lesions and microscopic foci of adenocarcinoma in the prostate. The limited results on the course of pre-malignant lesions diagnosed incidentally in patients over 60 years of age do not indicate that follow-up would have prompted the early diagnosis of invasive disease.",381,1
"Chromosomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: karyotypic patterns in disease subtypes. To define further the clinical importance of cytogenetic analysis in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) a prospective study was performed on 139 unselected children. Analyses were considered adequate in 104, of whom 35 were normal and 69 had clonal abnormalities. Abnormalities were categorised according to banded chromosome analysis as well as chromosome count. Karyotypes were correlated with clinical and laboratory features at diagnosis and with survival. Of the successful analyses, thirty five (34%) children had no abnormalities; this group contained an excess of T cell disease. Twenty five (24%) had a ""characteristic"" hyperdiploid karyotype and as a group had lower presenting white counts, a tendency to CD10, and periodic acid schiff positivity of the blast cells and smaller spleens. None was an infant and only one was over 10 years old. Seven (7%) children with t(9; 22), t(8; 14), or t(4; 11) translocations were grouped together as ""specific"" translocations. Collectively they had a significantly worse prognosis than the remainder. Nine children developed central nervous system relapse, six of whom had either t(4; 11) or abnormalities of 9p or 19p. A descriptive classification taking into account chromosome bonding pattern is cytogenetically more appropriate and may be more clinically useful than grouping children simply by chromosome number. As knowledge and techniques improve, the classification of cytogenetic abnormalities in ALL will need to be kept under frequent review.",344,1
"The recalcitrant perineal wound after rectal extirpation. Applications of muscle flap closure. Perineal wounds developing after abdominoperineal resection result in chronic purulent drainage and intermittent episodes of sepsis and are generally unresponsive to conservative medical and surgical treatment. Thirteen consecutive patients (aged 27 to 74 years; mean, 48 years) who underwent debridement and immediate muscle flap closure of these wounds were analyzed to identify risk factors for delayed healing and to evaluate the effectiveness of muscle flap coverage. Three risk factors were identified: preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy, resection for recurrent carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 19 muscle flaps (11 gracilis, five gluteal thigh, two gluteus maximus, and one rectus abdominis) were used to close these wounds. During an average 3.5-year follow-up, four (31%) minor complications and one (8%) recurrence were noted to occur. Muscle flaps provide safe, effective, single-stage procedures for the closure of chronic perineal wounds.",219,0
"The origin of epidermal melanocytes. Implications for the histogenesis of nevi and melanomas. Among the most venerable concepts in dermatopathology is Unna's 19th century notion of Abtropfung, ie, that melanocytes drop off from the epidermis to the dermis during the histogenesis of melanocytic tumors. Paradoxically, however, Unna's basic premise of an epidermal origin for melanocytes has been seriously questioned for over 40 years, based on experimental evidence favoring a neural crest origin for melanocytes. Recent work has strengthened the evidence for a neural crest origin of epidermal melanocytes, and it has been suggested that the concept of Abtropfung be replaced by the concept of Hochsteigerung. The concept of Hochsteigerung holds that melanocytes migrate up from the dermis into the epidermis-not only in normal development, but also during normal tissue maintenance. It now seems likely that the precursor of melanocytes, in both normal and abnormal differentiation, may not be a melanoblast (a primitive cell committed to melanocytic differentiation) but rather a pluripotential cell. Although axon-investing Schwann cells have been the traditional focus as the closest relative of the epidermal melanocyte, recent studies suggest that another nerve sheath cell, the perineural cell, might be a better candidate. These concepts have profound implications for the histogenesis of melanocytic nevi and melanomas.",285,1
"An analysis of randomized trials evaluating the effect of cholesterol reduction on total mortality and coronary heart disease incidence. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the relation between cholesterol reduction and total mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence. Secondarily, the clinical issues of whether the efficacy of cholesterol lowering is dependent on the treatment modality, presence of CHD at baseline, or the simultaneous introduction of other interventions was explored. All randomized clinical intervention trials of cholesterol reduction were used in an overview analysis of total mortality rate and CHD incidence; analysis was performed with weighted linear regression. The trials include those that used primary and secondary intervention, diet and drugs, and single or multifactor design. Nineteen trials were analyzed for total mortality, and of the 19, 16 were analyzed for CHD incidence rate. Net difference in cholesterol change between study groups was used as the independent variable, and the three previously mentioned dichotomous design characteristics were used as additional independent variables. For every 1% reduction in cholesterol, an estimated 2.5% reduction in CHD incidence is indicated (95% CL: 1.1, 3.9). With regard to CHD drug trials tended toward better efficiency in cholesterol lowering than did dietary trials. With regard to total mortality, this efficiency was higher in secondary than in primary preventive trials. The efficiency was also somewhat dependent on the baseline cholesterol level. This study shows that cholesterol reduction is effective in lowering CHD incidence, but cholesterol reduction must be at least 8-9% to be effective in lowering total mortality.",316,0
Deep vein obstruction and leg swelling caused by femoral ganglion. We present a case of a rare ganglion cyst originating from the hip joint and compressing the common femoral vein producing signs and symptoms that mimicked a deep vein thrombosis. Excision of the mass promptly restored normal venous return. This condition has not been previously reported in the English-language medical literature. ,72,0
"Secreted or nonsecreted forms of acidic fibroblast growth factor produced by transfected epithelial cells influence cell morphology, motility, and invasive potential. Addition of exogenous acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) to NBT-II epithelial carcinoma cells results in fibroblastic transformation and cell motility. We have generated aFGF-producing NBT-II cells by transfection with recombinant expression vectors containing human aFGF cDNA, or the human aFGF cDNA coupled to a signal peptide (SP) sequence. The effects of the nonsecreted and the secreted 16-kDa growth factor on the morphology, motility, and cell invasive potential (gelatinase activity) were compared. aFGF coupled to a SP was actively secreted out of the producing cells. The secretion of aFGF was not necessary for induction of gelatinase activity, as this was observed in NBT-II cells producing aFGF with or without SP. Production of aFGF, whether secreted or not secreted, resulted in increased in vitro motility of most isolated clones; however, there was no correlation between aFGF level and motility rate. The data suggest that expression of aFGF in NBT-II cells induces metastatic potential through an autocrine or intracrine mechanism.",256,1
"Imaging the gallbladder: a historical perspective. After Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen's discovery of the X-ray in 1895, it was initially thought that gallstones could not be visualized. Surgeons relied solely on the clinical examination to detect biliary disease. Today, no evaluation of the gallbladder would be complete without the performance of an imaging study. Radiology has gone through several eras in the imaging of gallstones. The plain film era, 1895-1924, was characterized by techniques that improved soft-tissue detail, allowing better detection of radiopaque stones. The contrast media era, 1924-1960, was initiated by the invention of IV cholecystography. In 1925, oral cholecystography was developed. During the era of expanding technology, 1960-1979, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, scintigraphy, and sonography came into use. The therapeutic era began in the 1980s.",215,0
"Acquired benign esophagorespiratory fistula: report of 16 consecutive cases. Sixteen cases of acquired benign esophagorespiratory fistula were treated in a 20-year period. A delay in diagnosis was usual, and most patients were first seen with a pulmonary infection already developed. Contrast esophageal x-ray studies established the diagnosis in all patients. There were seven esophagotracheal and nine esophagobronchial fistulas. A fistula between the esophageal diverticulum and a bronchus considered to be of inflammatory origin developed in 7 patients. A fistula as the consequence of trauma developed in 9 patients, and these fistulas were situated at a higher level of the respiratory tree. All patients underwent surgical treatment; in 12 it was definitive, and in 4 temporary gastrostomy was performed to improve nutrition before definite repair. The definitive repair consisted of eventual diverticulectomy, division of the fistula, and suture of both esophageal and respiratory defects. Two patients required esophageal resection and later reconstruction with colon interposition. One patient died, creating an operative mortality of 8.3% in the definitive-repair group. The remaining 11 patients had a gratifying long-term result. There were two deaths in the gastrostomy group due to an extremely poor condition of patients and debilitating pulmonary infection. Early diagnosis of this rare condition is necessary if severe pulmonary complications are to be avoided. Early direct repair gives excellent results.",295,0
"Fine needle aspiration biopsy in the diagnosis and management of fibroadenoma of the breast. Cytological and histological biopsies were obtained on 75 breast lumps clinically diagnosed as fibroadenomas. Of these, 95 per cent of lesions were benign. In 51 (68 per cent) confirmed as fibroadenomas histologically, cytology was benign in 78 per cent, but inadequate for diagnosis in 16 per cent. The remaining 24 lesions included three breast cancers and one lymph node with Hodgkin's disease. In this group cytology was inadequate for diagnosis in 54 per cent, including one breast cancer. No lesion with benign cytology was subsequently shown to be malignant. The study supports the view that clinical diagnosis and cytology are accurate in the diagnosis of benign breast disease of this type. Breast cancer may rarely present with the clinical features of a fibroadenoma and too few lesions have been studied to assess fully the performance of cytological biopsy in detecting these small mobile lesions. A non-excisional policy should therefore include prolonged follow-up and repeat biopsy.",228,1
"Prospective observations of 100 high-risk neonates by high-field (1.5 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system: I. Intraventricular and extracerebral lesions. The results of observations of the first 100 neonates at the University of Texas Health Science Center (Houston) who received magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system by means of a high-field image (1.5 T) are reported. All were assessed prospectively to be at risk neurodevelopmental delay. This first report specifically addresses the appearance of primarily hemorrhagic intracranial lesions, including intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 28), and extracerebral lesions, which include 3 cases of venous sinus thrombosis (n = 20). The signal intensities of hemorrhage underwent a characteristic evolution with time with only minor variations in the study group. Magnetic resonance imaging detected direct evidence of hemorrhage for up to 2 months, but hemosiderin was detected as a late indicator of hemorrhage for up to 9 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was equal in benefit to head ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage, but magnetic resonance imaging was also able to approximate the time of onset of hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior for the evaluation of extracerebral hemorrhage; ultrasonography failed to detect any of these lesions and computed tomography detected only 3 of 7. Short-term neurological abnormality was assessed, but the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to predict long-term neurodevelopmental delay is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing project.",314,0
"Access to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. The American Cancer Society Hearings on Cancer and the Poor made visible to the nation the harsh realities and consequences of lack of access to health care among the poor and uninsured in America. Access to care is more than mere availability; it is also financial accessibility, effectiveness, acceptability, appropriateness, and comprehensiveness of care. The problems and consequences of lack of health care access and its impact on the cancer problem among poor Americans are explored, and ways practitioners and public advocates can improve access are suggested. Local communities have risen to action to make health care more accessible. Successful programs have done their research to document access problems; then they have taken their findings to county governments to request additional funding and to health care institutions to request institutional policy and service changes to make health care more available and accessible.

"Ovarian metastases are rare in stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Over a 32-year period at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center, all cases of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix were reviewed to determine the incidence of ovarian metastases in stage I disease. One of 25 patients (4.0%) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy and radical hysterectomy had a microscopic ovarian metastasis. A literature review identified nine additional patients who had ovarian metastases and stage I adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Including our series, the overall reported rate of ovarian metastases is 1.8%. All ten patients had at least one of the following additional characteristics: They were postmenopausal, they had adnexal pathology, or they had positive pelvic lymph nodes. Thus, ovarian preservation is warranted in premenopausal patients who do not have ovarian pathology or evidence of other metastatic disease at surgery. Bilateral oophorectomy may be performed if frozen-section examination of enlarged or suspicious nodes documents metastases. If the ovaries are left in the pelvis at the completion of the surgical procedure and microscopic spread to other pelvic tissues is documented, pelvic irradiation can be administered.",233,1
"Unusual variants of adrenal pseudocysts with intracystic fat, myelolipomatous metaplasia, and metastatic carcinoma. Five previously unreported cases of adrenal pseudocysts are described that demonstrate a wider range of histologic appearances than has been previously recognized in these lesions. One pseudocyst removed from an asymptomatic 59-year-old female contained intracystic nests of cytologically malignant cells of unknown origin. Workup revealed a left breast mass, which on biopsy showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with neoplastic cells that were cytologically similar to those found within the cyst contents. Four other pseudocysts are described with variable numbers of intracystic vascular structures and benign adrenal cortical cells. In addition, intracystic mature adipose tissue was observed in all four cases, with myelolipomatous metaplasia found in one. Awareness of the wide histologic variability of these lesions should improve diagnostic accuracy and allow distinction from adrenocortical neoplasia and myelolipoma.",198,1
"Intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor causes a cutaneous eruption The intravenous administration of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to three patients with leukemia who were receiving marrow aplasia-inducing chemotherapy resulted in the development of wide-spread erythematous macules and papules. The course of the eruption paralleled the time of infusion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Skin biopsy specimens taken from two of the eruptions displayed characteristic changes consisting of a variable mixture of granulocytes and lymphocytes, increased number and size of dermal macrophages, mild to moderate epidermal exocytosis, intercellular edema, and rare dyskeratotic keratinocytes. Immunophenotypic analysis of one specimen was notable for keratinocyte intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. Administration of the recombinant human cytokine in pharmacologic doses is postulated to induce changes in the immunologic status of the skin, resulting in the expression of a cutaneous eruption.",200,1
"Comparison of characteristics of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with head and neck cancer and those with gastric cancer. In ongoing reviews of 339 patients with surgically treated primary squamous cell carcinoma, there were 19 (5.6%) with concurrent gastric cancer and 11 (3.2%) with head and neck cancer. The incidences of intra-esophageal multiple occurrence of esophageal cancer are 27.3% and 26.3% in those with associated head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, respectively, and higher than 7.1% in those without such a concurrent cancer. There was no difference in the clinicopathological characteristics of those with concurrent head and neck and gastric cancers, except for the higher incidence of metachronous occurrence in the former. These findings suggest that, in cases of esophageal cancer associated with concurrent head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, intraesophageal multiplicity of the esophageal carcinoma is frequent and that preoperative serial evaluations is most important to design treatment and estimate the prognosis.",205,1
"Cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors. The authors studied data of combination assays of tumor markers, because simultaneous elevation of different types of tumor markers in the serum was puzzling. They interpreted such phenomena regarding cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors. The tissue expression of the antigens was compared with preoperative serum levels. Several different factors were found to cause the simultaneous elevation of two or three of these markers in the serum. Furthermore, even when the levels of some of the tumor markers were raised in the serum, the ovarian tumor did not always produce the marker by itself. This study indicates that immunohistochemical identification of a marker in tumor tissue is prerequisite to the use of that marker in the serum to monitor disease status.",175,1
"Marker profile of different phases in the transition of normal human ovarian epithelium to ovarian carcinomas. To investigate whether early changes in the transformation of normal ovarian epithelial cells into tumor cells can be detected with monoclonal antibodies, a comparative immunohistochemical study was performed on normal human ovarian mesothelial cells, cystomas, cystadenomas, ovarian carcinomas, as well as granulosa cell tumor. Using monoclonal antibodies against different keratin subtypes, it was shown that mesothelial cells, ovarian cysts, cystadenomas, and carcinomas all reacted positively with broad-spectrum anti-keratin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as well as with MAbs to keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19. Keratins 4 and 13 were not found in mesothelial cells, but positive groups of cells were identified in several cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas. While mesothelial cells did not react with the pan-epithelial marker BW495/36, invaginating metaplastic mesothelial cells, inclusion cysts, cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas showed an increasing reactivity with BW495/36, with an increasing degree of malignancy. The reactivity of MAbs against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OV-TL 3, OC 125, MOv 18, and OV-TL 10) was limited to weak staining reaction in some mesothelial cells but were found to be positive on more than 50% of the ovarian cystadenomas and more than 90% of the ovarian carcinomas. Thecal and granulosa cells of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles all reacted positively with antibodies to the broad-spectrum keratins OV-TL 12/5 and RCK 102, and to keratins 8 and 18, but not with keratins 4, 7, 13, and 19. These keratins decreased or disappeared in granulosa cells of mature follicles (Graafian follicles), whereas granulosa cell tumors did not react with anti-keratin antibodies. The reactivity of BW 495/36 was negative or limited to traces in some granulosa cells. Ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were not expressed in granulosa cells or granulosa cell tumors. The data indicate that mesothelial cells undergoing metaplastic changes finally resulting in ovarian cystadenomas (and carcinomas) initiate the synthesis of a 200-kd glycoprotein recognized by MAb (BW 495/36), the production of ovarian carcinoma associated antigens, in addition to focal production of keratin 4 and/or 13, as seen in several samples. The granulosa cell tumors decrease or switch off their keratin production and remain negative for the 200-kd glycoprotein and the ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens.",590,1
"Serum tumor markers and patient allocation to good-risk and poor-risk clinical trials in patients with germ cell tumors. The allocation of patients with advanced germ cell tumors (GCT) to different treatment programs based on clinical characteristics is standard in the design of clinical trials today. Studies have shown that substantial differences exist between entry criteria and that these differences could influence the outcome of clinical trials. The factors contributing to these differences are not clear due to patient selection biases. Two hundred five unselected and consecutive patients allocated to and treated in good-risk and poor-risk treatment programs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were reassigned risk status by the Indiana University (IU) Classification. The results were compared with those of the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG). The results using both criteria indicated substantial agreement in total end results and the identification of good-risk patients. The results in poor-risk patients differed substantially, with 39 patients (19%) classified as poor-risk by MSKCC criteria and 66 (32%) by Indiana criteria. The major discrepancy occurred in IU Stage 7, in which 26 of 32 patients (81%) achieved a complete response. The major factor contributing to this difference in risk assignment was the use of serum tumor markers. Serum tumor markers must be incorporated into risk assignment criteria for GCT clinical trials to minimize the number of good-risk GCT patients in poor-risk trials.",297,1
"A case of classical mycosis fungoides associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I. A 72-year-old male patient from north-eastern Iran developed the typical clinical and histopathological features of mycosis fungoides with lymphadenopathy, but without any other systemic involvement. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) antibodies were detected in the patient's serum by two different ELISAs and by Western blot using purified viral particles from MT-2 culture supernatants. Cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes were positive for labelling with anti-HTLV-I serum. Southern blot hybridization of DNA extracted from a skin tumour and from an involved lymph node revealed integrated proviral DNA with identical restriction patterns. This case supports a relationship between mycosis fungoides and HTLV-I and may indicate a new region of endemic HTLV-I infection.",180,1
"Transient hyperprolactinemia is associated with a midcycle luteinizing hormone surge. This study demonstrates that LH surge cycles in IVF patients were associated with significantly higher serum PRL concentrations than cycles in which a spontaneous LH surge did not occur.

"Clinicopathologic features of hepatocellular carcinoma in young patients. To investigate clinicopathologic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young adults, excised tumors from 21 patients younger than 45 years (young group) were compared with findings in tumors from 204 patients older than 45 (old group). In the young group HCC showed (1) a high incidence of positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (young 71.4% versus old 20.1%); (2) relatively well-preserved hepatocellular function (indocyanine green test; young 10.7 +/- 8.8% versus old 20.6 +/- 10.8%); (3) low incidence of histologically verified concomitant cirrhosis (young 52.4% versus old 78.4%); and (4) a more advanced stage of the disease in TNM classification (Stage III; young 52.4% versus old 18.1%). With respect to survival rates achieved by surgery, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Thus, hepatitis B virus may relate to the occurrence of HCC in the young patients. Despite the advanced stage in the young group, survival rate after surgery was comparable with that achieved in the old group. These observations mean that a close periodic surveillance of young adults with a positive HBsAg is required to detect HCC at an early stage. Treatment of patients with HBsAg using interferon or vidarabine and hepatitis B vaccine should be made to convert HBsAg to negative in these individuals.",331,1
"The role of tumor-derived cytokines on the immune system of mice bearing a mammary adenocarcinoma. I. Induction of regulatory macrophages in normal mice by the in vivo administration of rGM-CSF. Using a dimethylbenzanthracene-induced immunogenic nonmetastatic murine mammary adenocarcinoma in BALB/c mice, our previous work has shown that splenocytes from tumor bearers have reduced responses to both mitogens and Ag including tumor-associated Ag. NK and cytotoxic T cell activities are also reduced in splenocytes of tumor bearers. Mac-1+2+ macrophages induced in mammary tumor bearers are capable of down-regulating lymphocyte responses to mitogens and tumor-associated Ag by cell to cell contact interaction and increased PGE2 production. We have found that the tumor constitutively releases a granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF-like factor in vivo and in vitro, which may be responsible for the systemic increase in cells of the macrophage lineage in tumor-bearing mice. A tumor cell line established from the in vivo tumor expresses and releases GM-CSF as shown by Northern and Western blot analyses. Daily i.p. injections for 3 wk of 10,000 U of rGM-CSF into normal mice induces hemopoietic and immunologic alterations similar to those observed in tumor bearers. Mac-1+ and/or Mac-2+ macrophages can also be detected in the spleens and bone marrow of the mice treated with rGM-CSF. Additionally, splenocytes from rGM-CSF-treated mice have reduced responses to mitogens and their peritoneal exudate cells can cause in vitro down-regulation of proliferative responses of lymphocytes from normal mice. The suppression can be partially reversed by the addition of indomethacin to the cultures suggesting that PGE2 may contribute to the effect. rGM-CSF enhances the in vitro release of PGE2 by the spleen, bone marrow, and peritoneal cells of normal mice. These data indicate that the high levels of GM-CSF constitutively produced by the tumor may be responsible for the hemopoietic changes and immunologic alterations observed in tumor-bearing mice.",429,1
"Radical intracapsular removal of acoustic neurinomas. Long-term follow-up review of 11 patients. Historically, the neurosurgical treatment of large acoustic neurinomas has developed with two principal goals: complete tumor removal and preservation of facial nerve function. A recent goal for small tumors is the preservation of hearing. Out of a personal series of 124 acoustic neurinomas treated over the past 35 years, the senior author has undertaken a radical intracapsular approach in 12 patients with large tumors (greater than 3 cm in diameter). Surgical indications for intracapsular removal included advanced age (five cases), the patient's wish to avoid any risk of facial paralysis (six cases), contralateral facial palsy (one case), and contralateral deafness (one case). Eleven of these 12 patients were available for follow-up review. Tumor recurrence developed in two patients (18%) at 2 and 3 years postoperatively; there were no late recurrences. Four patients died of unrelated causes, 10 to 19 years after surgery. The remaining five patients have survived a mean of 12 years since surgery without recurrence (range 3 to 22 years). Facial function was preserved in nine patients (82%). The results suggest that radical intracapsular removal may be the procedure of choice under certain circumstances and may offer an alternative to focused high-energy radiation.",291,0
"Ureterosigmoidostomy: long-term results, risk of carcinoma and etiological factors for carcinogenesis. We followed postoperatively 75 patients who underwent ureterosigmoidostomy between 1942 and 1987. Of the patients 30 were asked to undergo routine examination, including fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy with biopsy and analysis of a urine-feces slurry for nitrate, nitrite and nitrosamines in comparison to 20 control volunteers. After a mean observation of 14 years 7 months (1 to 46 years) 64.5% of the patients had bilaterally normal kidneys without any previous complications, 77.5% of the renal units being normal. Sigmoidoscopic biopsy revealed 3 carcinomas at the ureterocolonic junction resulting in an 8.5 to 10.5-fold increased risk of colon carcinoma compared to the general population. The excretion of nitrite and N-nitrosamines was increased, and nitrate excretion was decreased compared to healthy control volunteers, suggesting endogenous formation of nitrosamines by bacterially reduced nitrate and endogenous amines. The urological long-term results of ureterosigmoidostomy are similar to those of conduits. However, the increased incidence of colon carcinoma is not yet proved to be higher than in conduits.",271,1
Epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma. Three cases of epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma are summarized and compared with reported cases.

"Drug-induced DNA damage and tumor chemosensitivity. Cytotoxic drugs act principally by damaging tumor-cell DNA. Quantitative analysis of this interaction provides a basis for understanding the biology of therapeutic cell kill as well as a rational strategy for optimizing and predicting tumor response. Recent advances have made it possible to correlate assayed DNA lesions with cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines, in animal models, and in patients with malignant disease. In addition, many of the complex interrelationships between DNA damage, DNA repair, and alterations of gene expression in response to DNA damage have been defined. Techniques for modulating DNA damage and cytotoxicity using schedule-specific cytotoxic combinations, DNA repair inhibitors, cell-cycle manipulations, and adjunctive noncytotoxic drug therapy are being developed, and critical therapeutic targets have been identified within tumor-cell subpopulations and genomic DNA alike. Most importantly, methods for predicting clinical response to cytotoxic therapy using both in vitro markers of tumor-cell sensitivity and in vivo measurements of drug-induced DNA damage are now becoming a reality. These advances can be expected to provide a strong foundation for the development of innovative cytotoxic drug strategies over the next decade. ",226,1
"Follow-up of patients with low output, low gradient hemodynamics after percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty: the Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry. Symptomatic patients with a low cardiac output and low aortic valve gradient have a poor prognosis but are at high risk for aortic valve surgery. The outcome of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty in this subgroup of patients is unclear. Therefore, 67 patients (group 1) underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty between December 1, 1986 and November 1, 1987 who had a low cardiac index (less than 2.5 liters/min per m2) and a low aortic valve gradient (less than or equal to 40 mm Hg) before the procedure. The results were compared with 200 patients (group 2) who had a low cardiac index but not a low aortic valve gradient (greater than 40 mm Hg) before the procedure and who had similar baseline presenting symptoms. After balloon aortic valvuloplasty, there was a greater decrease in aortic valve gradient in patients in group 2 than in patients in group 1 (mean +/- SD -33.0 +/- 16.7 mm Hg and -14.6 +/- 6.9 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.001) although there was no significant difference in improvement in estimated aortic valve area (0.31 +/- 0.21 and 0.31 +/- 0.22 cm2, respectively; p = NS). In-hospital mortality was 11.9% for patients in group 1 which was not significantly different from the 7.5% mortality for patients in group 2. However, the actuarial probability of survival at 12 months for patients who survived the initial hospitalization was 46% in group 1 and 64% in group 2 (p less than 0.05).

Significant growth retardation was found in 115 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had completed their growth.

Patients' heights at diagnosis were within expected ranges, but final heights were greater than or equal to 1 SD below population means in 74% of cases and greater than or equal to 2 SD in 37%. Effects on growth were more pronounced for children who had received craniospinal irradiation, but decrements were also significant in the cranial irradiation group, with adult heights greater than or equal to 2 SD below population norms in 32%. Growth retardation was significantly greater (P less than .0001) in children who had earlier disease onset. Growth deceleration occurred not only during chemotherapy but during a later period that followed an interval of improved growth in many cases. Thus, late decrements in growth may be missed in studies that do not follow patients until they have attained final heights. These findings indicate that abnormally short stature among survivors of ALL merits further clinical and research attention.",275,1
"Genetic construction and characterization of a fusion protein consisting of a chimeric F(ab') with specificity for carcinomas and human IL-2. A genetic construct was created incorporating gene fragments encoding the H chain V region of the human carcinoma specific antibody L6, the CH1 domain of human IgG1, a linker region, and human IL-2. This construct was cotransfected with a chimeric L6 L chain construct into the murine myeloma cell line Ag8.653 for expression. First round clones produced the fusion protein at an estimated 5 to 10 micrograms/ml based on idiotypic reactivity. Dual binding activity was demonstrated through specific interaction with the L6 Ag on human tumor cells and the IL-2R on activated human T cells. The IL-2 portion of the molecule was shown to support the growth of the IL-2-dependent T cell line CTLL2, and the qualitative nature of the IL-2 signal was found to be the same as rIL-2 with respect to induction of tyrosine-phosphorylation of intracellular protein substrates. Tumor cells coated with the fusion protein were shown to cause T cell proliferation and the presence of the fusion protein was found to enhance cell-mediated destruction of human tumor cells.",256,1
"Tenascin expression in hyperproliferative skin diseases. The expression of tenascin, a recently discovered extracellular matrix glycoprotein, was studied by immunohistochemistry in normal human skin and in a number of skin diseases with epidermal hyperproliferation such as psoriasis, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and solar keratosis. Tenascin expression in the upper dermis of normal skin was found to vary from almost absent to patchy along the basal membrane. Staining was continuous and intense around blood vessels, hair follicles and eccrine sweat ducts. In basal cell carcinoma a marked expression of tenascin was found in the tumour stroma, especially adjacent to the basal membrane surrounding the tumour cell nests. In Bowen's disease and solar keratosis, tenascin expression was found in the dermis next to the keratinocytes. In psoriasis the dermal papillae of clinically involved skin were intensely stained and a continuous band of tenascin was present in the upper dermis along the basal membrane. The distribution of tenascin differed from other known extracellular matrix components. ",208,1
"Effect of interleukin-1-beta on metastasis formation in different tumor systems. Experiments were done to determine the effect of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta) on metastasis formation in different tumor systems. Intravenous administration of 1 microgram of human recombinant IL-1 beta given 1 hour before tumor cell injection augmented lung colony formation (experimental metastases) by the human A375 melanoma variants, the human HT-29M colon carcinoma, the SN12-K1 renal carcinoma in nude mice, the murine B16 melanoma variants, and the murine UV-2237M fibrosarcoma in syngeneic recipients. The same treatment did not induce lung colony formation by a human rectal carcinoma (HCC-P2988) or by a murine reticulum cell sarcoma (M5076), both of which are not metastatic to the lung. Spontaneous metastases were studied in C57BL/6 mice bearing the B16-BL6 melanoma (metastatic to the lung) in their footpad and the M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma (metastatic to the liver) subcutaneously. Daily intraperitoneal treatment with 1 microgram of IL-1 beta increased lung and liver metastases. These findings indicate that treatment of mice with IL-1 beta can increase the number of artificial or spontaneous metastases and that this effect is not limited to a single tumor type or to a specific organ.",295,1
"Small cell lung cancer: staging with MR imaging. Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive neoplasm; metastases are detected in two-thirds of patients at diagnosis with use of conventional staging, which includes bilateral bone marrow biopsy, bone scintigraphy, and computed tomography (CT) of the head and abdomen. In 25 patients, small cell lung cancer was staged prospectively with both conventional staging and a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol that included 1.5-T MR imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, spine, and brain. According to conventional staging, 14 patients had extensive disease and 11 patients had limited disease; according to staging with MR, 19 patients had extensive disease and six had limited disease. All metastatic disease sites seen with conventional staging were identified on MR images. MR images showed additional metastatic involvement in bone (four patients) and liver (three patients) not detected at conventional staging. A low-attenuation hepatic lesion on a CT scan was identified as a hemangioma on MR images. These preliminary data suggest that small cell lung cancer may be accurately staged with use of a single MR imaging study.",232,1
"Granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma. Their distinction with the use of immunohistochemical methods. Granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma can mimic each other both clinically and histologically. To develop criteria useful in resolving problem cases, the authors compared the reactivities of these conditions (nine cases of granulomatous prostatitis and six cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma) with a panel of antibodies to cytokeratin (AE1/3), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), lysozyme, antimacrophage M, and leukocyte common antigen (LCA). In granulomatous prostatitis, histiocytes were not immunoreactive for PAP, PSA, or cytokeratin; however, histiocytes reacted to lysozyme in nine of nine cases, antimacrophage M in seven of nine cases, and LCA in one of nine cases. Tumor cells from all six carcinoma cases reacted with PAP, PSA, and cytokeratin; all failed to react with lysozyme, LCA, and antimacrophage M. The authors conclude that granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated carcinoma can be reliably distinguished with immunohistochemical methods.",239,1
"A prospective, randomized evaluation of the treatment of colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver. Over a 4-year period (1982 to 1986), 91 patients with solitary or multiple metastases from colorectal cancer were stratified, based on findings at laparotomy, to one of three groups and then prospectively randomized to one of two treatment arms within each group. Group A patients had solitary resectable metastases, group B patients had multiple, resectable metastases, and group C patients had multiple, unresectable metastases. Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms within a group: group A-arm A1: resection only, arm A2: resection and continuous hepatic artery infusion (CHAI) of fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR); group B-arm B1: resection and CHAI, arm B2: CHAI only; group C-arm C1: CHAI, arm C2: systemic fluorouracil followed by CHAI. Median time to failure (TTF) was 31.8, 11.1, and 8.8 months for groups A, B, and C, respectively. Arm A2 had an improved TTF when compared with arm A1 (P = .03). Median survival correlated with extent of disease and was 37.3, 22.4, and 13.8 months for groups A, B, and C, respectively. Survival was not changed by treatment variation (arms) within each group. Two- and 5-year cumulative survivals for groups A, B, and C were 72.7% and 45.4%; 45.8% and 16.7%; and 31.7% and 3.2%, respectively. In patients with multiple metastases (groups B and C), those patients whose original tumor was a Dukes' B had a significantly improved TTF and survival over those patients whose tumor was a Dukes' C (P less than or equal to .02).",422,1
"ST segment alternans during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty--a case report. The occurrence of electrical alternans of the ST segment has been reported in patients with variant angina. The authors encountered a patient with typical electrical alternans of the ST segment in leads V4 through V6, which developed during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Hemodynamic pulsus alternans of the aortic pressure tracing was not observed during electrical alternans, and a Ca2+ blocker could not prevent this phenomenon during PTCA.",119,0
"Multimodal therapy in locally advanced breast carcinoma. Among 879 patients treated for breast cancer between 1975 and 1984, advanced disease was found in 125 (14%). A subgroup of 34 (4%) presented with untreated locally advanced disease without demonstrable distant metastases at the time of diagnosis (stage IIIB = T4abed, NX-2,MO). During the first 5 years (1975 through 1979), 17 patients were treated primarily with sequential radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Group A). From 1980 to 1984 (Group B), the management consisted of four courses of induction multi-drug chemotherapy followed primarily by mastectomy and additional chemotherapy. The mean follow-up for the most recent group (Group B) is 48 months. Follow-up was complete. While the local disease control rate was the same for both groups (76%), the survival was remarkably different. Group A patients experienced a median survival of 15 months, and only one survived 5 years. In Group B, the median survival was 56 months with nine patients (53%) alive between 40 and 76 months, seven (41%) of whom are 5-year survivors. While the overall mortality of patients with inflammatory breast cancer was greater in both groups when compared with the group with noninflammatory disease, the survival of patients in Group B was better than in Group A for both inflammatory and noninflammatory cancers (p less than 0.01). Estrogen receptor, nodal, and menopausal status did not influence survival. These data suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves survival for patients with stage IIIB breast carcinoma and delays the establishment or progression of distant metastases. Mastectomy is an important component in the treatment of this disease.",384,1
"Elapsed time from symptom onset and acute myocardial infarction in a community hospital. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Previous reports have emphasized that thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction should be initiated within three or four hours of symptom onset to obtain the best clinical outcomes. However, our clinical impression was that late arrivers, who often do not receive thrombolytic therapy, have a good short-term prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the relationships among the elapsed time from symptom onset, thrombolytic therapy, and short-term prognosis in acute myocardial infarction patients. The research hypothesis was that late arrivers have a better in-hospital prognosis because they have less severe disease that may involve spontaneous thrombolysis. DESIGN: Observational cohort study based on reviewing medical records and emergency department service logs. SETTING: 500-bed teaching hospital with medical school affiliation in northeastern Ohio. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred consecutive patients with acute infarction confirmed by chest pain and positive ECGs or elevated cardiac enzymes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients arriving early (elapsed time less than or equal to 1.5 hours) were more likely to be in Killip class III or IV (P = .04) or to have hypotension (P = .0004); and they experienced twofold increased odds of ventricular tachycardia (P = .007), cardiac arrest (P = .03), or death (P = .01). Patients arriving late (elapsed time greater than 3.5 hours) were more likely to have a history of angina (P = .002) and had a better short-term prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Time of ED arrival after onset of acute myocardial infarction symptoms distinguishes two patient groups that differ in their risk of in-hospital complications. Late arrivers have better short-term prognoses and less (acutely) severe disease, and may have less need for thrombolytic therapy because of possible spontaneous thrombolysis. Patients with prior angina may need education on seeking care if their symptoms change.",402,0
"Changes in the relative frequency of gastric adenocarcinoma in southern California. The incidence of gastric cancer is decreasing in most counties of the developed world, but at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, we diagnosed 99.8 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma per 10(5) discharges in the period 1982 to 1986 as opposed to 62.2 per 10(5) discharges in 1972 to 1976 (P less than .0001). This change involved primarily Hispanics younger than 30 years of age with 30 cases per 10(5) vs 4.2 cases per 10(5) (P less than .0001) and whites older than 30 years: 87 cases per 10(5) vs 54 cases per 10(5) (P less than .05) during 1982 to 1986 and 1972 to 1976, respectively. There was no change in the relative frequency rates of gastric adenocarcinoma among African Americans and Asians. Although these changes do not seem important enough to make the detection of gastric cancer a high-priority public health problem, they should alert physicians working in areas with high Hispanic populations of the relative possibility of the occurrence of gastric malignancy even in young patients. Also, we have found that gastric cancer is still prevalent in whites of low socioeconomic class.",313,1
"Giant enterocystoma within an infant's tongue. A rare developmental cyst within the tongue and submandibular triangle of a male infant containing heterotopic gastric and intestinal epithelium (enterocystoma) is described and its derivation discussed. This cyst was of such a size as to cause feeding difficulties and partial airway obstruction during sleep. Following C.T. scanning, total obstruction necessitated an emergency tracheostomy. Successful enucleation via a median labiomandibulotomy was performed without further complication and two years later there is no sign of recurrence. ",111,1
"A controlled trial of nebulized isoetharine in the prehospital treatment of acute asthma. Acute asthma is a potentially life-threatening disorder, recognizable to the prehospital care provider. While therapies are available to the prehospital care provider for treating acute asthma, no previous controlled studies have been performed demonstrating the treatment in the field is efficacious and safe. The authors conducted a controlled trial of the prehospital use of nebulized isoetharine in an urban emergency medical services system. Fifty-two patients with acute asthma were studied. Patients were initially evaluated with a peak flow meter. Half of the patients received isoetharine, while the control group received basic life support only. There was no difference in baseline values. Peak expiratory flow increased from 138 L/min to 148 L/min in the control group, while it increased from 149 L/min to 218 L/min in the treatment group (P less than .001). The authors conclude that paramedic treatment of acute asthma with nebulized isoetharine is effective in improving pulmonary function and clinical status during transport.",228,0
"Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. The development of language skills in the isolated right hemisphere was investigated by comparing the performance of 3 left hemispherectomized with that of the 3 right hemispherectomized patients and three groups of control subjects on baseline clinical measures of language and on production and judgement of morphological markers. The initial brain insult in the hemispherectomy patients of each group had occurred either during early, middle or late childhood. The left hemispherectomy patients were severely impaired in language processing across all three stages of language development. The consequences of a right hemisphere insult on language development were more restricted, with deleterious effects being apparent only in the case in which the lesion was acquired during early childhood.",149,0

"Brain death and organ donation in a neurosurgical unit: audit of recent practice OBJECTIVE--To assess the potential for increasing the yield of donors by comparing the current pattern of brain death and organ donation in a neurosurgical unit with that reported in 1981 and with a recent national audit. DESIGN--Retrospective review of all deaths for 1986, 1987, and 1988 and prospective data for 1989. SETTING--A regional neurosurgical unit serving 2.7 million population. RESULTS--Of 553 deaths, 35% (191) patients died while on a ventilator and 17% (92) after discontinuation of ventilation. Medical contraindications to donation were found in 23% (32) of 141 patients tested for brain death, in 38% (19) of 50 patients who died while being ventilated who were not tested, and in 12% (11) of 92 patients no longer being ventilated. Consent for donation was sought in 88% (96) of 109 medically suitable brain dead patients and granted in 70% (67) of these. Half those with permission for multiorgan donation had only the kidneys removed. CONCLUSIONS--More organs may be lost owing to transplant team logistics than by failure to seek consent from relatives of brain dead patients. The estimated size of the pool of potential donors depends on what types of patients might be considered. Ensuring that all who die while being ventilated are tested for brain death and considering the potential for donation before withdrawing ventilation could yield more donors. Ventilating more patients who are hopelessly brain damaged to secure more donors raises ethical and economic issues.",364,0
"Hyperandrogenism in peripubertal girls. Androgens arise from either adrenal or ovarian secretion or by peripheral conversion of secreted precursors. The adrenals and ovaries normally contribute about equally to testosterone and AD production. DHAS is the major adrenal 17-KS. Testosterone is the major circulating form of androgen. More than 96% of plasma testosterone is bound to SHBG; the free testosterone seems to be the bioavailable fraction. Hyperandrogenism must be considered in any girl with premature or excessive development of public hair or acne, menstrual irregularity (whether it be oligo-amenorrhea or dysfunctional uterine bleeding), or obesity. The most common cause of premature public hair development (pubarche) is premature adrenarche. The most common cause of hyperandrogenism presenting in a teenage girl is polycystic ovary syndrome. However, the differential diagnosis includes ""exaggerated adrenarche,"" late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, virilizing tumors, Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, and abnormalities of androgen action or of metabolism. The plasma free testosterone is a more sensitive indicator of hyperandrogenism than is the total testosterone concentration. The pattern of response of plasma free testosterone, DHAS, and cortisol to dex-suppression testing is diagnostic of the source of androgen excess. Most hyperandrogenic adolescents will be found to have PCOS. The treatment is chosen according to particular symptoms, such as menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, or obesity.",304,1
"Induced abortions, contraceptive practices, and tobacco smoking as risk factors for ectopic pregnancy in Athens, Greece. A case-control study of the role of induced abortion and other factors on the subsequent occurrence of ectopic pregnancy was undertaken in 1986-1987 in Athens, Greece, where a similar study 20 years ago found a tenfold risk of ectopic pregnancy among women with one or more illegal induced abortions. Seventy women residents of Athens, consecutively admitted to the major state maternity hospital with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, were individually matched with women with a newly diagnosed pregnancy of the same order as the ectopic index pregnancy. Two control women were found for each of 63 cases, but only one control for each of the remaining seven cases. All cases and controls were interviewed by the same qualified obstetrician. Statistical analysis was undertaken with stratification of individual matched triplets and pairs, as well as through conditional multiple regression procedures. The relative risk of recurrence of an ectopic pregnancy was 6.39 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-21.04. Miscarriages did not increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The relative risk for subsequent ectopic pregnancy among women with one or more induced abortion, compared to women without such abortions, was 1.87 (CI 0.84-4.16) controlling only for the matching factors, and 1.71 (CI 0.69-4.27) when marital status (a possible selection factor) was also accounted for in the conditional logistic regression. There was no evidence for increasing risk with increasing number of induced abortions. Past use of an intrauterine device (IUCD) was associated with a relative risk of 3.89 (0.72-21.02); the relative risk increased with the duration of use of the IUCD.",397,0
"When epilepsy masquerades as heart disease. Awareness is key to avoiding misdiagnosis.

"Neurovascular mechanisms and sodium balance in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Physiological studies have clarified the role that the brain has in the interplay between salt balance and hypertension. Neural mechanisms and endocrine secretions play a pivotal role in the adaptation of mammals to changes in the intake and excretion of sodium. Maneuvers that alter the concentration of sodium in the plasma modify the sensitivity of baroreceptor reflexes and alter vascular reactivity. These changes may be mediated in part by the release of vasopressin. The research also suggests that the brain indirectly modulates the ability of the vascular endothelium to release vasoactive factors. Collectively, these studies illustrate the multiple effects of the sodium ion on the peripheral neural and central endocrine mechanisms that participate in the regulation of arterial pressure.

"Subarachnoid hemorrhage of unknown etiology: early prognostic factors for long-term functional capacity. Forty-one patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of unknown etiology were re-investigated at an average of 91 months after the bleed to determine functional capacity. Nineteen patients were performing at their previous level of work, five were employed part-time, and four could not work due to the SAH. Five patients showed a moderate disability in activities of daily living but were not dependent on help, one patient was severely disabled, and two had died. There was one rebleed. Early prognosis of an unfavorable outcome was possible on the basis of three clinical variables on admission: a history of hypertension, a Hunt and Hess grade of greater than II, and the presence of focal neurological deficits. In addition, the presence of an organic mental syndrome at discharge was identified as a predictive factor for reduced functional capacity later on. Other clinical variables in the acute stage, including sex, age, history of headache, interval between SAH and admission, impaired consciousness, and cognitive deficits, were not related to a limited functional level. Residual neurological deficits and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score on discharge were also not predictive of restrictions in global functions evaluated by means of the Karnofsky Performance Scale status at follow-up review.",260,0
"Tissue-specific transformation by epidermal growth factor receptor: a single point mutation within the ATP-binding pocket of the erbB product increases its intrinsic kinase activity and activates its sarcomagenic potential. Avian c-erbB is activated to a leukemia oncogene following truncation of its amino-terminal, ligand-binding domain by retroviral insertion. The insertionally activated transcripts encode protein products that have constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and that can induce erythro-leukemia but not sarcomas. We have found that a single point mutation within the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain in this truncated molecule can increase the ability of this oncogene to induce anchorage-independent growth of fibroblasts in vitro and fibrosarcoma formation in vivo. Associated with this increased transforming potential is a corresponding increase in the kinase activity of the mutant erbB protein product. The mutation, which converts a valine to isoleucine at position 157 of the insertionally activated c-erbB product, is at a residue that is highly conserved within the protein kinase family. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a point mutation in the ATP-binding pocket that activates a tyrosine kinase.",233,1

"Decreased ventilation and hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness are not reversed by naloxone in Lhasa residents with chronic mountain sickness. Persons with chronic mountain sickness (CMS) hypoventilate and are more hypoxemic than normal individuals, but the cause of the hypoventilation is unclear. Studies of 14 patients with CMS and 11 healthy age-matched control subjects residing in Lhasa, Tibet, China (3,658 m) were conducted to test the hypothesis that hypoventilation, blunted hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness (HVR), and hypoxic ventilatory depression of CMS were due to increased endogenous opioid production. Patients with CMS compared with control subjects exhibited hypoventilation (end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure [PETCO2] = 36.6 +/- 1.0 versus 31.5 +/- 0.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), lower tidal volume (VT = 0.54 +/- 0.02 versus 0.61 +/- 0.02 ml BTPS, p less than 0.05), blunted HVR (shape parameter A = 17 +/- 8 versus 114 +/- 22 mm Hg/L BTPS/min, p less than 0.05), and a depressant effect of ambient hypoxia on ventilation (delta PETCO2 with acute hyperoxia = -3.5 +/- 0.5 versus -1.0 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s to vital capacity ratios (FEV1/VC) and a higher proportion of cigarette smokers in the group of patients with CMS compared with control subjects suggested that at least some patients with CMS had mild airway obstructive lung disease.

"Steroid cell tumor of the ovary in a child. An 8-year-old girl exhibited severe, progressive virilization of 2 years' duration associated with markedly elevated circulating testosterone concentrations. Based on her initial clinical presentation and results of a chemical evaluation, she was originally thought to have non-classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but her condition did not respond to corticosteroid therapy. Further evaluation confirmed the presence of an ovarian neoplasm. The excised ovary contained an attached gray-brown mass. Light microscopic and ultrastructural examination revealed the mass to be a steroid cell tumor. Because Reinke's crystals were not present, it was designated to be a steroid cell tumor not otherwise specified. This case represents one of 22 reported cases of steroid cell tumor occurring in children described in the literature, most of which have been associated with heterosexual precocity. To our knowledge, steroid cell tumors are benign when they occur in prepubertal children. Although they are rare, steroid cell tumors of the ovary should be considered in cases of childhood virilization.",215,1
"Chondrosarcoma of the larynx. Diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Chondrosarcomas are the most common sarcomas of the larynx. They are generally slow-growing lesions with insidious onset of symptoms. We are presenting a case of chondrosarcoma that recurred 10 years after excision of a presumed chondroma. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. Both studies delineated the lesion nicely. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on MRI characteristics of chondrosarcoma of the larynx. A review of the literature regarding the use of computed tomography in the management of chondrosarcoma is presented. The MRI characteristics are discussed and the two scanning modalities are compared. Computed tomography is an excellent study in its ability to demonstrate the extent of the lesion within the laryngeal skeleton. Furthermore, it is more highly sensitive than plain roentgenograms in the detection of calcifications that are highly suggestive of chondrosarcoma. Alternatively, MRI can also demonstrate the lesion within the larynx but it has the added advantage of superior contrast resolution of the tumor and paralaryngeal tissues. When the three-dimensional imaging capacity of MRI is considered as well, MRI seems to be the superior study.",250,1
"Changes in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in acute viral hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. Forty-four male and female subjects aged 22-57 years were studied. Thirteen patients had acute viral hepatitis, and eleven patients had cholestatic jaundice due to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Twenty healthy volunteers who served as controls were also included. In hepatitis patients, the mean plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-phospholipid/phospholipid (HDLPL/PL) ratio were reduced, and HDL-cholesterol (HDLC), HDL-phospholipid (HDLPL) and the phospholipid/total cholesterol (PL/TC) ratio were normal, while total phospholipid (PL) levels and the HDLC/TC ratio were significantly increased compared to the control values. In patients with cholestatic jaundice the mean plasma total cholesterol, phospholipid and HDLC levels were elevated, and HDLPL/PL, HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC remained normal compared to the control values. A comparison within the patient groups showed that plasma TC, PL and HDLC levels were significantly increased in cholestatic jaundice when compared with the corresponding levels in hepatitis patients. The mean plasma levels of HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC did not show any significant variation within the patient groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) correlated positively with TC, and total protein correlated negatively with TC and HDLPL, while albumin correlated negatively with TC, HDLC and HDLPL in cholestatic jaundice. Alanine amino-transferase (ALAT) also correlated positively with PL in cholestatic jaundice, while albumin correlated positively with TC in hepatitis. The results suggest that lipoproteins might be metabolized differently in these two forms of cholestasis.",365,1
An epithelial cyst in the cerebellopontine angle. Case report. A case of a benign epithelial cyst in the posterior cranial fossa is described. It had the unique histological feature of a double-layered cuboidal epithelial lining. Detailed immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies supported an endodermal origin. The differential diagnosis and the histogenesis of epithelial cysts in the central nervous system are discussed. ,80,1
"The efficacy of central venous and pulmonary artery catheters and therapy based upon them in reducing mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of the central venous pressure and flow-directed pulmonary artery catheters used to maintain normal hemodynamic values as therapeutic goals in the control groups vs supranormal values empirically observed in critically ill postoperative survivors in the protocol groups, and (2) to evaluate tissue perfusion and oxygenation in relationship to organ failure and mortality. In two prospective clinical trials there were no significant differences in outcome between the central venous pressure and pulmonary artery control groups that used normal values as therapeutic goals. However, there were marked and significant reductions in morbidity and mortality of the protocol groups using the supranormal cardiac index, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption values as goals. The cumulative oxygen debt was less and organ failures were fewer and less severe in the protocol groups than in the control groups.",188,0
"Syringomatous squamous tumors of the breast. Four cases are reported of syringomatous squamous tumors of the breast occurring in women aged 37 to 70 years. The lesions were characterized histologically by relatively well-circumscribed tumor-like nodules composed of a proliferation of teardrop or comma-shaped islands of squamous epithelium. The squamous epithelial islands contained central lumens lined by eosinophilic cuticles and were surrounded by a densely cellular fibrous matrix, thus closely resembling the growth pattern of dermal eccrine syringomas. The lesions appeared to arise de novo from breast parenchyma without evidence of transitions with the surrounding normal or hyperplastic mammary epithelium and were not associated with the overlying skin or nipple epidermis. In all cases, the surrounding breast tissue showed fibrocystic and benign proliferative changes, and in one case, the lesion was found in the vicinity of a large cyst surrounded by microcalcifications. All patients were treated by local surgical excision and have shown no evidence of recurrence over a follow-up period of 1 to 6 years. The histologic differential diagnosis and the possible pathogenesis of these lesions are discussed.",225,1
"Surgical strategy for early gastric cancer. The diagnostic and therapeutic options in early gastric cancer are reviewed. In Japan, the rate of detection of early gastric cancers has increased so that minute gastric cancers can now be identified as a result of advances in diagnostic methods. The results of histopathological staging of a large number of resected specimens have led to three surgical options based on size and depth of the primary lesion, namely classical R2 resection, radical resection with limited lymphadenectomy and endoscopic surgery.",98,1
"Postoperative pancreatic abscess due to Plesiomonas shigelloides. Plesiomonas shigelloides is being recognized with increasing frequency as a human pathogen. The organism is ubiquitous in fresh and brackish water, and clinical illness has been associated with foreign travel and ingestion of inadequately cooked seafood. We describe a 64-year-old Filipino woman who presented 2 weeks after elective cholecystectomy and pancreatic biopsy with left upper quadrant pain, abdominal distention, and fever. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed an abscess in the tail of the pancreas with fluid accumulation in the lesser omental sac. Percutaneous aspiration yielded purulent material, and P. shigelloides was recovered in pure culture. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pancreatic abscess due to P. shigelloides.",169,0
"Cervical rotation flaps for midface resurfacing. The midface has long served as a focus for creativity in surgical reconstruction. Full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness grafts, and distal flaps have long been used to attempt to reduplicate existing anatomy in this area. Recent reconstruction efforts have focused on the creative use of microvascular free flaps for this purpose. This article reports on the use of extensively developed regional rotation flaps as an excellent reconstructive modality for use in this area of the face. The details of surgical incisional planning are given. The nuances of surgical creation of these flaps and their rotation and suspension into place are given. The cases we have done using this technique for the past 3 years are reviewed. Our present indications for use of these flaps and their limitations are given.",160,1
"Use of arterial compliance for evaluation of hypertension. Arterial compliance describes a change in the volume of arteries following a change in blood pressure. The physical basis of the compliance concept and experimental procedures in animals both indicate that the relation between arterial compliance and blood pressure pattern is often unclear. Compliance is pressure-dependent because of the biphasic elastin and collagen composition of arteries and, hence, decreases when blood pressure increases. Compliance also determines the pulsatile amplitude of the pressure wave by regulating the buffering function of an artery's face to the cardiac pump and, accordingly, its reduction induces a selective increase in systolic level. The questions are whether these theoretical and experimental phenomena can be extrapolated to human hypertension and whether they can be assessed from indirect measurement of arterial compliance by means of a time-domain analysis of arterial pressure and flow waves via various models of the arterial tree. Whatever the method and site of measurement, arterial compliance was found to be decreased in different forms of hypertension. This low compliance can be considered to have a causal role in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. In contrast, in patients with systolo-diastolic hypertension physiologic and pharmacologic arguments exist against the fact that low arterial compliance may be the pure consequence of mean blood pressure elevation. Moreover, it is suggested that aging acts in concurrence with pressure elevation to decrease arterial compliance, and that in certain hypertensive patients additional factors, perhaps atherosclerotic in nature, contribute to impair the elastic properties of arteries.

"Evaluation of postprandial hyperemia in superior mesenteric artery and portal vein in healthy and cirrhotic humans: an operator-blind echo-Doppler study. In an operator-blind design, we used an echo-Doppler duplex system to examine superior mesenteric artery and portal vein hemodynamics on two consecutive mornings in 12 fasting cirrhotic patients and 12 matched controls, randomized to a standardized 355 kcal mixed-liquid meal vs. water. Cross-sectional area and mean velocity were recorded from the portal vein and superior mesenteric artery at 30 min intervals, from 0 min to 150 min after ingestion. Flows were calculated. Pulsatility index, an index related to vascular resistance, was obtained for the mesenteric artery. Baseline flows did not differ between cirrhotic patients and control patients, but pulsatility index was reduced in the cirrhotic subjects. Maximal postprandial hyperemia was attained at 30 min. Cirrhotic patients showed a blunted hyperemic response to food. In normal controls, portal vein area increased significantly after the meal from 30 min to 150 min, whereas in cirrhotic patients a significant difference occurred only at 30 min. Pulsatility index in both groups was significantly reduced after eating, and this reduction persisted up to 150 min. No changes after ingestion of water were observed. Echo-Doppler was very sensitive in detecting postprandial splanchnic hemodynamic changes and differences between cirrhotic patients and normal subjects. Mesenteric artery pulsatility index was more sensitive than flow in detecting baseline hemodynamic differences. In cirrhotic patients, portal postprandial hyperemia was mainly related to the increase in mean velocity.",360,0
"Nerve growth factor corrects developmental impairments of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the trisomy 16 mouse. The trisomy 16 (Ts16) mouse, which shares genetic and phenotypic homologies with Down syndrome, exhibits impaired development of the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Basal forebrains obtained from Ts16 and euploid littermate fetuses at 15 days of gestation were dissociated and cultured in completely defined medium, with cholinergic neurons identified by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity. The Ts16 cultures exhibited fewer ChAT-immunoreactive neurons, which were smaller and emitted shorter, smoother, and more simplified neurites than those from euploid littermates. Whereas the addition of beta-nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) augmented the specific activity of ChAT and neuritic extension for both Ts16 and euploid cholinergic neurons, only Ts16 cultures exhibited an increase in the number and size of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons. Furthermore, Ts16 ChAT-immunoreactive neurites formed varicosities only in the presence of beta-nerve growth factor.",240,0
"Antibiotic compared with antiseptic prophylaxis for prostatic surgery. Two different regimens of cephalosporin antibiotic prophylaxis were compared with antiseptic lubricating jelly to try to prevent infection and complications in 196 men after prostatic surgery. Pre-operative urine was cultured and prostatic chips (170 cases) were also cultured to define the source of any infection. The use of antibiotics was associated with a reduced risk of postoperative bacteriuria. No serious complications occurred, although 1 patient in the antiseptic treated group developed rigors; 79 of 170 patients (46%) had positive prostatic chip cultures, of whom 74 had sterile pre-operative urine. There was no association between the result of chip culture and the presence of a pre-operative catheter. Culture positive patients had an increased risk of post-operative urine infection, although the same organism was found in the prostate and urine in only 36% of cases of post-operative bacteriuria and in 43 (54%) the organism cultured from the prostate was Staphylococcus albus. This study provides further evidence of the benefit of true prophylactic antibiotic therapy for transurethral prostatic surgery and the prostatic chip data suggest that some of the risk is due to pre-operative contamination of the prostate in the absence of per-operative urinary infection or catheterisation.",273,0
"Nodular regenerative hyperplasia: a cause of ascites and hepatomegaly after chemotherapy for leukemia. Tender hepatomegaly and ascites occurred in a young woman receiving cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin for acute myelogenous leukemia. Whereas veno-occlusive disease was suspected clinically, liver biopsy showed nodular regenerative hyperplasia with no evidence of hepatic vein abnormalities. It is postulated that nodular regenerative hyperplasia can be initiated by hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy agents used to treat leukemia and/or that these agents exacerbate clinical manifestations of this histological abnormality. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia should be added to the list of liver problems occurring in patients with leukemia. ",132,0
"Effect of the topical anesthetic EMLA on the efficacy of pulsed dye laser treatment of port-wine stains. EMLA cream (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) is a new topical anesthetic composed of 25 mg lidocaine and 25 mg prilocaine in an oil-in-water emulsion cream. It has been found to be very effective for local anesthesia prior to venepuncture, minor surgical procedures, and pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy for port-wine stains (PWS) in children. However, since EMLA may cause vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels, we tried to determine whether pretreatment with EMLA decreases the efficacy of subsequent PDL treatment. We report eight patients between the ages of 4 and 32 years with PWS who received two test site treatments prior to PDL treatment. One site was pretreated with EMLA cream under occlusion for 60 minutes and then left unoccluded for 15 minutes prior to PDL test treatment. The other site, in the same area of the PWS and patient's body, was not pretreated with EMLA. The test sites were compared 6-8 weeks later to determine whether EMLA decreased the degree of lightening of the PWS compared to the non-EMLA-treated site. We conclude that EMLA is an effective topical anesthetic for PDL treatment of PWS and does not adversely affect the efficacy of the treatment.",295,0
"The electrocardiogram in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The electrocardiogram is often abnormal in patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most frequent abnormalities are a rightward P-wave axis (greater than or equal to 70 degrees) and a rightward QRS axis (greater than or equal to 90 degrees). In addition, low voltage in the limb leads, an S1S2S3 pattern, poor R-wave progression, a posterior-superior terminal QRS vector or other changes may be present. Transient atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias are common. Knowledge of the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease enables the clinician to recognize uncharacteristic abnormalities, which often represent the effects of superimposed illnesses or drug toxicity.",149,0
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome.",202,0
"Thermographic findings in cranio-facial pain. This work assesses the differences in the thermographic findings in the craniofacial and neck areas between normal individuals and patients with craniofacial pain or headache, and investigates the influence of muscle contraction on such findings. Thermographic records were taken in 10 healthy subjects and 47 patients suffering from craniofacial pain or headache of different kinds. In the patients with painful episodes the record was taken between attacks. In all the normal subjects and in 19 patients lateral thermograms were also taken during and after maximal tooth clenching for three minutes. The majority of the patients, as compared to the normal group, showed some thermal alterations and asymmetry. Such alterations seem to be due both to vascular instability and muscle contraction: these two factors may be variably superimposed in the different conditions. In patients with cluster headache or chronic paroxysmal hemicrania the presence on the symptomatic side of a cold spot along the supraorbital area and/or the inner orbital canthus, was a constant finding. We conclude that thermography is useful as an additional diagnostic means in patients with head and face pain, and that the clenching test may increase the amount of information provided.",245,0

"Murine retroviral neurovirulence correlates with an enhanced ability ofvirus to infect selectively, replicate in, and activate resident microglial cells [published erratum appears in Am J Pathol 1991 May;138(5):1058] To determine the biologic basis of ts1 MoMuLV neurovirulence in vivo, newborn CFW/D mice were inoculated with neurovirulent ts1 MoMuLV and nonneurovirulent wt MoMuLV and the temporal response to virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS), spleen, and thymus was studied comparatively. Experimental procedures included single and double labeling in situ immunohistochemistry with selective morphometric analyses, and steady state immunoblotting of viral proteins. Cellular targets for virus infection were identical for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV and consisted sequentially of 1) splenic megakaryocytes, 2) splenic and thymic lymphocytes, 3) CNS capillary endothelial cells, and 4) CNS pericytes and microglia. Resident microglial cells served as the major reservor and amplifier of virus infection in the CNS of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice; a similar but much less significant role was played by microglia in wt MoMuLV-infected mice. The genesis and progression of severe spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice were both temporally and spatially correlated with amplified virus infection of microglia, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of both virus-infected and nonvirus-infected microglial cells. Direct virus infection of neurons was never observed. The development of clinical neurologic disease and spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice correlated with the accumulation of both viral gag and env gene products in the CNS; there was no selective accumulation of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env. When compared to wt MoMuLV-infected mice, the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice occurred by an enhanced ability to replicate in the CNS and to infect and activate more microglia, rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism or topography of virus infection.",430,0
Bladder perforation resulting from the use of the neodymium:YAG laser. Complications resulting from the use of the neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser to treat superficial bladder cancer are uncommon and are usually associated with abnormally high laser power outputs.

"Extracranial repair of cerebrospinal fluid fistulas: technique and results in 37 patients. Although neurosurgeons have traditionally preferred intracranial repair for the management of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas, this approach is associated with the complications of a craniotomy, anosmia, and a high incidence of recurrent fistulas. Extracranial repair, on the other hand, produces no central nervous system morbidity, preserves olfaction, and is associated with a low incidence of recurrence. Although there have been several reports of extracranial repair of CSF fistulas by otorhinolaryngologists, this approach has received scant mention in the neurosurgical literature. We report here our experience with 37 patients with CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea who underwent extracranial repair. The etiology of the fistula was postoperative in 22, traumatic in 6, and spontaneous in 9. The fistulas were repaired using one of four techniques: external ethmoid-sphenoid in 18 patients, transmastoid in 9, transseptosphenoid in 7, and osteoplastic frontal sinusotomy in 3. In 32 of the 37 patients (86%) the fistulas were successfully repaired with the initial procedure. Of the 5 patients requiring a second operation, the fistula was successfully closed in 4 for an overall success rate of 97%. Complications were few and consisted of a transient facial paresis in a patient undergoing transmastoid repair and one death from meningitis. The authors conclude that because of low morbidity and mortality and a high success rate in closing fistulas, extracranial repair is the preferred technique for the operative management of CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea.",347,1
"Second cancer after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix. Radiation-induced cancers after radiation therapy for cancer of the uterine cervix were investigated on 11,855 patients including 5725 patients treated with radiation therapy alone, 1969 postoperative radiation therapy and 4161 surgery alone. The observed-to-expected ratios of the second primary cancer was 0.933 for the patients with radiation therapy alone and 1.074 for the patients with postoperative radiation therapy, respectively. No significant increase was observed in the risk of second primary cancers when all sites were combined. However, assessing on site by site basis, significant excess was noted for the rectum cancer, leukemia, and bladder cancer for the radiation therapy group but not for the surgery group. A significant excess of lung cancer was observed in both radiation therapy and surgery groups, which was attributed to some other causative factors. Radiation-induced cancers were suggested to develop apparently in organs involved in the irradiated field.",205,1
"Morphologic comparison of patients with mitral valve prolapse who died suddenly with patients who died from severe valvular dysfunction or other conditions. Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 56 patients with mitral valve prolapse: 15 patients, aged 16 to 69 years (mean 39), died suddenly and mitral valve prolapse was the only cardiac condition found at necropsy (hereafter called isolated mitral valve prolapse); the remaining 41 patients had other conditions that were capable of being fatal. Of the latter 41 patients, 7, aged 17 to 59 years (mean 45), had associated congenital heart disease, and 34 patients, aged 17 to 70 years (mean 52), had no associated congenital cardiac abnormalities. Compared with the 34 patients without associated congenital heart disease and with nonmitral valve prolapse conditions capable in themselves of being fatal, the 15 patients who died suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse were younger (mean age 39 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 15 years; p = 0.01), more often women (67% versus 26%; p = 0.008) and had a lower frequency of mitral regurgitation (7% versus 38%; p = 0.02). The 15 patients dying suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse also were less likely to have evidence of ruptured chordae tendineae (29% versus 67%; p = 0.04). The frequency of increased heart weight (67% versus 59%), a dilated mitral valve anulus (80% versus 81%), a dilated tricuspid valve anulus (17% versus 17%), an elongated anterior mitral leaflet (86% versus 54%), an elongated posterior mitral leaflet (79% versus 77%) and fibrous endocardial plaque under the posterior mitral leaflet (73% versus 63%) was similar between the two groups. The severity of the prolapse (mild 20% versus 11%; moderate 27% versus 58%; severe 53% versus 32%) also was similar between the two groups. Thus, persons with mitral valve prolapse dying suddenly without another recognized condition tend to be relatively young women without mitral regurgitation.",502,0
"Benign parotid tumour enucleation--a reliable operation in selected cases. The method of surgical treatment for benign tumours of the parotid gland had not yet been rationalized, but many authors recommend parotidectomy as the most appropriate procedure. A series of 289 operations for parotid swelling is reported; the majority of mixed and Warthin's tumours underwent enucleation without either complications or recurrence. The rationale of parotidectomy versus enucleation is discussed but in fast growing, deeply infiltrating and recurrent tumours, parotidectomy appears to be the best choice. In the other group of more commonly occurring tumours, enucleation represents a reliable time saving option.",139,1
"Racial differences in cerebrovascular disease hospitalizations. We studied the relationship of race to incidence of hospitalization for cerebrovascular disease among 74,096 white and 33,041 black persons who took health examinations in a prepaid health care program. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, body mass index, coffee use, smoking, alcohol use, systolic blood pressure, and baseline disease. Blacks were at higher hospitalization risk than whites for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease (relative risk = 2.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-5.8), cerebral thrombosis (relative risk = 1.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.9), and nonspecific cerebrovascular disease (relative risk = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.2) but at lower hospitalization risk for extracranial occlusive disease (relative risk = 0.4, 95% confidence interval = 0.2-0.7). Blood pressure had a similar relation to all types of cerebrovascular disease in both races, but there were disparities in the relations of other atherosclerosis risk factors to different types of cerebrovascular disease. Educational attainment had little relation to hospitalization for extracranial occlusive disease, a finding that reduces the likelihood that selection bias explains the racial disparity. These data show unexplained racial differences in the type and location of cerebrovascular disease. The differences are important in understanding the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease and have practical clinical implications.",315,0
"Effectiveness of high-dose MCNU therapy and hematopoietic stem cell autografts treatment of childhood acute leukemia/lymphoma with high-risk features. Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies were performed regarding the toxicity of methyl 6-[3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosoureido]-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MCNU) with other drugs, in conjunction with a peripheral blood stem cell autograft (PBSCT), for treating 26 children with acute leukemia or lymphoma associated with high-risk features. In the early phase of the study, MCNU (300 to 500 mg/m2) was administered with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (1.6 to 16 g/m2), etoposide (VP-16) (0.8 to 1.6 g/m2), cyclophosphamide (CY) (100 to 200 mg/kg), or busulfan (16 mg/kg). No acute toxicity was noticed after this high-dose therapy. The dose-limiting factor of the regimens was significant but reversible interstitial pneumonitis (IP). In a subsequent trial with an MCNU/VP-16/Ara-C/CY (MCVAC) regimen in which the dose of MCNU was reduced, the risk of IP diminished. This study is still in progress, but the clinical response has so far been encouraging. Fifteen of 26 children are alive and well in unmaintained complete remission (CR) with a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 3 to 34 months) after transplantation. This MCNU-based regimen without total body irradiation (TBI) is especially important in children to avoid the serious sequelae of irradiation. Our results justify a broader clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the MCVAC regimen followed by PBSCT.",405,1
"Immunohistochemical detection of P-glycoprotein in endometrial adenocarcinoma. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has emerged as the central mediator in classic multidrug resistance in model systems in vitro. High levels of Pgp also have been detected in many normal human tissues and tumors; and its role in clinical drug resistance is currently under investigation. Recently significant levels of Pgp were localized to gravid and secretory endometrium; and it was demonstrated that the combination of estrogen and progesterone is sufficient to induce high levels of both Pgp mRNA and Pgp in uterine secretory epithelium. These findings suggest that increased Pgp expression also may be present in hormone-responsive malignancies such as endometrial adenocarcinoma. To determine whether Pgp is expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma, 36 endometrial adenocarcinomas (grade I [n = 17]; grade II [n = 6]; grade III [n = 13]) were investigated retrospectively by the avidin-biotin-complex immunohistochemical procedure using three murine monoclonal antibodies (MAb) MAb C219, MAb C494, and MAb JSB-1, which recognize spatially distinct cytoplasmic epitopes of Pgp. Seventy-two percent of the tumors showed positive immunostaining with at least one MAb; 67% showed immunostaining with MAb C219, 50% with MAb C494, and 62% with MAb JSB-1. Forty-six percent of tumors were immunoreactive to two and 29% to all three antibodies. Membranous and Golgi/paranuclear type staining patterns were observed. Overall the intensity of immunostaining varied from one sample to another for a given tumor type, and considerable heterogeneity of expression was commonly seen within a given tumor. Strong to moderate immunoreactivity was seen in diffusely infiltrating, adenosquamous, and serous papillary carcinomas. In general, immunoreactivity to MAb C494 was weaker than MAb C219 or MAb JSB-1. Adenomatous and non-neoplastic endometrium adjacent to the tumors displayed strong membranous immunostaining with MAb JSB-1. Endometrial capillaries showed weak-to-moderate immunostaining to all three antibodies. It is concluded that Pgp is commonly expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma and may be a significant factor responsible for their drug-resistant nature subject to modulation by progesterone.",499,1

"Natural history of cardiac rhabdomyoma in infancy and childhood. Although spontaneous regression of cardiac rhabdomyoma has been reported, prognosis is still considered to be poor and surgery continues to be indicated. The experience with rhabdomyoma diagnosed in live infants over a 20-year period was reviewed. Diagnosis by angiography or echocardiography was accepted only if multiple tumors were present or if tuberous sclerosis was also diagnosed. Nine patients (3 diagnosed prenatally and the remaining 6 at age less than 8 months) were identified as having a total of 24 tumors. Measurements in 2 planes demonstrated at least some evidence of regression in 24 patients (100%), with 20 of 24 having complete resolution. One patient required delayed surgery for excision of a subaortic ridge that appeared at the site of a resolved tumor. Our findings suggest that pediatric cardiac rhabdomyoma is most often a benign condition in which spontaneous regression is the rule. Surgery is recommended only for patients with refractory dysrhythmias or severe hemodynamic compromise.",221,1
"Management of macular puckers associated with retinal angiomas. Monocular visual loss in four patients was caused by epiretinal macular membranes associated with peripheral retinal capillary angiomas or angioma-like lesions. Three patients had solitary vascular lesions and one had two discrete vascular lesions. All patients were in good health, with no evidence of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. In three patients, spontaneous peeling of the macular membranes and visual improvement occurred 2 to 6 months after obliteration of the angioma-like lesions with cryotherapy (two patients), or cryotherapy combined with argon laser (one patient). The fourth patient underwent a vitrectomy 8 months after the macular pucker had failed to respond to treatment of the vascular lesion.",149,1
"Plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptide concentration determination in patients with diarrhea. Determination of plasma levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been used for screening patients with chronic diarrhea to identify potential neuroendocrine tumors. This 6-year blinded study from 1981 to 1986 examines the causes of elevated VIP levels in patients. In healthy volunteers ( n = 144), VIP concentrations ranged from 14 to 76 pg/mL (mean +/- SE, 28 +/- 12), whereas in chronic renal failure, 4 of 34 patients or 12% [serum creatinine 4.5 - 9.0 mg/dL (397-795 mumols/L)] had an elevation to greater than 100 pg/mL. No patient with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis (n = 12) had elevation of serum concentration of this peptide. Among 588 consecutive unselected patients undergoing evaluation for chronic diarrhea (n = 362; 62%) or possible neuroendocrine tumor (n = 214; 36%), 23 patients (3.9%) had concentrations greater than 76 pg/mL. In this group, 5 patients had functioning (VIP, 160-5975 pg/mL) and 5 had nonfunctioning (VIP, 80-120 pg/mL) pancreatic islet cell carcinomas: all 10 patients had hepatic metastases. Other known cases of elevated levels of VIP, ranging from 80 to 340 pg/mL, included other neurogenic tumors (n = 3), small- bowel resection (n = 2), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 2), chronic renal failure (n = 1), and prolonged fasting (n = 1). Patients with diarrhea in which VIP-secreting tumors were identified had plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide concentrations greater than 140 pg/mL. In patients with chronic diarrhea, determination of plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide levels did identify tumors secreting this peptide, but the results from this referral institution did not show identification of these tumors early in their clinical course.",458,0
"Expression of the human nephron differentiation molecules in renal cell carcinomas. The authors tested frozen sections from 28 renal cell carcinomas (RCC)--21 clear, 1 eosinophilic, 4 basophilic, and 2 spindle-shaped cell type--with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) reacting against cytokeratin, vimentin, CD24, CALLA/CD10, villin, CD26, and HLA class I and class II molecules. These molecules are markers of specific segments of the mature kidney, and their loss or acquisition reflects the different steps of human nephrogenesis. KI67 MAb was used to evaluate cell-proliferating activity. All RCC cases expressed cytokeratin. Coexpression of vimentin was observed in 21 of 28 cases. Whether of clear or chromophilic type, all tumoral cells strongly expressed CD24 molecule, present on primitive blastema cells. All clear-type RCCs expressed CALLA/CD10 and 60% were also villin positive; some were faintly positive for CD26. CALLA, villin, and CD26 were not detected in basophilic cell type. HLA class I molecules were variably expressed in almost all cases, but HLA class II were never detected on tumoral cells. Except for the spindle-shaped population, cell-proliferating activity was low. These results favor the hypothesis that RCCs derive from cells that have 'recovered' the different options of metanephric differentiation. Clear cells show evidence of maturation toward proximal type, while basophilic cells do not. It would be of interest to evaluate the usefulness of serum measurements of villin and/or CALLA as markers in clear cell-type RCC.",359,1

Southern blot hybridization has been used to identify human papillomavirus types in both primary tumors and lymph node metastases. However, this technique requires fresh-frozen tissue and is incapable of localizing deoxyribonucleic acid sequences to specific cell types in the tumor sample. In contrast, in situ hybridization precisely locates viral sequences within tumor cells while preserving cellular architecture. Further, in situ hybridization requires only small samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Five lymph nodes (from four patients) containing metastatic cervical squamous tumor cells (identified with hematoxylin and eosinophil staining) were analyzed with in situ hybridization techniques with human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid probes labeled with sulfur 35. The primary cervical cancer from all four patients had been shown to contain human papillomavirus type 16 sequences by Southern blot. Three specimens from two patients clearly showed the presence of human papillomavirus type 16 sequences within the nuclei of metastatic tumor cells, whereas two specimens were nondiagnostic most likely as a result of the small volume of cancer relative to the size of the lymph node. This information indicates that it is the tumor cells themselves that contain viral deoxyribonucleic acid and provides additional evidence linking human papillomavirus with cervical carcinogenesis.",277,1
"Comparison of continuous subcutaneous and intravenous hydromorphone infusions for management of cancer pain. To compare the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous and intravenous infusion of opioid analgesics, a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial was carried out in inpatients. 15 patients with severe cancer pain received two 48 h infusions of hydromorphone--one subcutaneously and one intravenously in randomly allocated order. The study was made double-blind by the use of two infusion pumps throughout; during the active subcutaneous infusion the intravenous pump delivered saline and vice versa. Serial measurements of pain intensity, pain relief, mood, and sedation by means of visual analogue scales showed no clinically or statistically significant difference between the two infusion routes. Side-effects were slight, and the mean number of morphine injections for breakthrough pain did not differ significantly between the routes (4.8 [SD 4.5] for intravenous vs 5.3 [5.6] for subcutaneous). Plasma hydromorphone concentrations measured at 24 h and 48 h of infusion showed stable steady-state pharmacokinetics; the mean bioavailability from subcutaneous infusion was 78% of that with intravenous infusion. Because of the simplicity, technical advantages, and cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous opioid infusion into the chest wall or trunk, intravenous opioid infusion for the management of severe cancer pain should be abandoned.",277,0
"Photochemotherapy alone or combined with interferon alpha-2a in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Eighty-two patients with either mycosis fungoides (MF) or parapsoriasis en plaques were treated with psoralens ultraviolet A light (PUVA). Clinical and histologic parameters were followed for a period from 6 months to 10 years. Complete clinical clearing of lesions was observed in 51 patients (62%) and most of them were in limited-plaque MF group or parapsoriasis en plaque. The mean total dose of PUVA for complete clearing was less for early MF. Thirty-one patients (38%) relapsed and responded to additional PUVA. Patients in early stages of the disease remained clear for up to 68 months after the first course of PUVA. Post-treatment skin biopsies with early MF showed histologic clearing. A new combination therapy for MF is presented in 15 patients. Recombinant interferon alpha-2a (Roferon-A), administered intramuscularly combined with PUVA were tested in a phase I trial. Interferon doses were from 6-30 million units three times weekly. Disease stages ranged from I-B to IV-B. Complete responses were obtained in 12 of 15 patients, and partial responses seen in 2 of 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 93%. The median duration of response exceeded 23 months (range, 3 to 25 months). All responding patients have been maintained on therapy. The dose-limiting toxicities were constitutional symptoms such as fevers and malaise (93.3%), leukopenias (40.0%), mental status changes consisting of depression and confusion (33.3%), and photosensitivity (26.6%). Interferon plus PUVA appear to be highly effective regimens for the treatment of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.",394,1
"Systemic alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine: a diagnostic test for sympathetically maintained pain. The diagnosis of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) is typically established by assessment of pain relief during local anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic ganglia that innervate the painful body part. To determine if systemic alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine can be used to diagnose SMP, we compared the effects on pain of local anesthetic sympathetic ganglion blocks (LASB) and phentolamine blocks (PhB) in 20 patients with chronic pain and hyperalgesia that were suspected to be sympathetically maintained. The blocks were done in random order on separate days. Patients rated the intensity of ongoing and stimulus-evoked pain every 5 min before, during, and after the LASB and PhB. Patients and the investigator assessing pain levels were blinded to the time of intravenous administration of phentolamine (total dose 25-35 mg). The pain relief achieved by LASB and PhB correlated closely (r = 0.84), and there was no significant difference in the maximum pain relief achieved with the two blocks (t = 0.19, P greater than 0.8). Nine patients experienced a greater than 50% relief of pain and hyperalgesia from both LASB and PhB and were considered to have a clinically significant component of SMP. We conclude that alpha-adrenergic blockade with intravenous phentolamine is a sensitive alternative test to identify patients with SMP.",309,0
"A rhesus monkey model for sexual transmission of a papillomavirus isolated from a squamous cell carcinoma. Recently we molecularly cloned and characterized a papillomavirus from a lymph node metastasis of a primary penile carcinoma found in a rhesus monkey; this virus species, rhesus papillomavirus type 1 (RhPV-1), is similar to oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), such as HPV-16 or HPV-18, in that the RhPV-1 DNA was found to be integrated in the tumor cell DNA. To compare the sexual transmission and oncogenic nature of RhPV-1 with these HPVs, we undertook an extensive retrospective study of a group of rhesus monkeys whose sexual mating and offspring histories were known. These animals had mated directly with the index male mentioned above or were secondarily exposed to this virus through intermediate sexual partners. This study combines cytological, histopathological, and several complementary hybridization and DNA amplification techniques on multiple tissue samples to demonstrate the sexually transmitted nature of RhPV-1. The oncogenic potential of RhPV-1 is suggested in several of the infected animals by the presence of various degrees of neoplasia including squamous cell cancer of the cervix.",244,1
"Adult phosphorylase b kinase deficiency. Phosphorylase b kinase deficiency affecting muscle has been observed infrequently in children with weakness and hepatomegaly, and in 2 adults with cramps on exertion. We observed 2 additional adults with phosphorylase b kinase deficiency: Patient 1, aged 58, had progressive, predominantly distal weakness since age 46 but no cramps on exertion; Patient 2, aged 26, had cramps on exertion since age 6 but no weakness. Lactate production on ischemic exercise was impaired only in Patient 1. The serum creatine kinase level was elevated in both. Muscle specimens showed focal glycogen excess in both, and a necrotizing myopathy and mild denervation atrophy in Patient 1. Muscle phosphorylase b kinase activity was 0.5% and 8.9% of the lowest control value in Patients 1 and 2, respectively; erythrocyte phosphorylase b kinase activity was normal in both; liver phosphorylase b kinase activity, measured in Patient 1, was also normal. Other glycolytic enzymes in muscle were preserved in both.",222,0
"The influence of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus on immediate and 3-month morbidity and mortality after acute stroke. Fasting serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine concentrations were determined in 304 consecutive subjects admitted with acute stroke, within 48 hours of ictus. Based on the medical history and these results, subjects were divided into known diabetics, newly diagnosed diabetics, subjects with stress hyperglycemia, and nondiabetics. The type of stroke was classified as lacunar infarct, cerebral infarct, or intracerebral hemorrhage, based on clinical examination by a neurologist and computed tomographic brain scan and/or autopsy. Immediate and 3-month outcomes were examined in relation to (1) fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine levels by stroke subtypes, and (2) glucose tolerance categories by stroke subtypes. A high fasting glucose level was associated with an increased mortality, but this was observed only among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients with stress hyperglycemia, but not diabetics, had increased mortality. In spite of having similar glucose concentrations to those patients with stress hyperglycemia, diabetics did not have a worse outcome compared with nondiabetics. It is concluded that the association between glucose concentration and outcome is a reflection of stress relating to stroke severity, rather than a direct harmful effect of glucose on damaged neurons.",276,0
"Is banding of the pulmonary trunk obsolete for infants with tricuspid atresia and double inlet ventricle with a discordant ventriculoarterial connection? Role of aortic arch obstruction and subaortic stenosis Banding the pulmonary trunk may exacerbate or promote the development of subaortic stenosis in patients with double inlet ventricle or tricuspid atresia with a dominant left ventricle and discordant ventriculoarterial connection and, therefore, may be an inappropriate palliative procedure for such patients. To examine this possibility, 102 consecutive infants were studied who presented with this anatomy between 1972 and 1987. Obstruction of the aortic arch was present in 52 patients. In 28 patients (17 with aortic arch obstruction), subaortic stenosis was already apparent at presentation. Of the remaining 74 patients, 19 received no palliative surgery and 55 underwent banding of the pulmonary trunk either with (n = 22) or without (n = 33) aortic arch repair. Outcome was significantly worse in patients with associated aortic arch obstruction. All such patients either died or developed subaortic stenosis by 3 years of age (survival free of subaortic stenosis 0 of 22 versus 22 of 33 for patients with isolated banding of the pulmonary trunk, p less than 0.001). After isolated banding, there was a lower ratio of the ventricular septal defect to ascending aorta diameters at presentation in the patients who developed subaortic stenosis than in the patients who did not (0.60 +/- 0.08 versus 1.03 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.001). Of the latter, 18 (95%) of 19 patients fulfilled criteria for a Fontan procedure at recatheterization. Thus, the presence of aortic arch obstruction is associated with rapid development of subaortic stenosis after banding of the pulmonary trunk. Alternative initial surgery, even though high risk, may be indicated. In the absence of such obstruction, banding the pulmonary trunk can be performed at reasonable risk and, provided that the ventricular septal defect is of adequate size, satisfactorily prepares most patients for a later Fontan procedure.",463,0
"Increased plasma endothelin-1 in pulmonary hypertension: marker or mediator of disease? OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of endothelin-1, a potent endothelial-derived vasoconstrictor peptide, in pulmonary hypertension, by measuring its concentration in arterial and venous plasma. DESIGN: A survey, case series study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: Twenty-seven patients with pulmonary hypertension: 7 with primary, and 20 with secondary pulmonary hypertension of various causes. The control groups (n = 16) comprised 8 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with coronary artery disease but without evidence of pulmonary hypertension. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly increased (94/43 +/- 23/13 mm Hg) in the patients with pulmonary hypertension. Venous plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1, measured by a specific radioimmunoassay, was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension (3.5 +/- 2.5 pg/mL, P less than 0.001) than in normal subjects (1.45 +/- 0.45 pg/mL), or patients with coronary disease (0.75 +/- 0.64 pg/mL). The arterial-to-venous ratio of immunoreactive endothelin-1 was significantly greater than unity in primary pulmonary hypertension (2.21 +/- 0.72, P = 0.01), whereas the patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension had a mean ratio not different from 1 (0.97 +/- 0.42). In contrast, the mean arterial-to-venous ratios were significantly less than unity in both control groups (0.59 +/- 0.35, and 0.54 +/- 0.64; P less than 0.02, for normal subjects and coronary disease patients, respectively), indicating a possible clearance of endothelin-1 across the healthy lung. CONCLUSIONS: Patient with pulmonary hypertension have substantial alterations in plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1, which may reflect changes in net release or clearance of endothelin-1 by the lung. In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the high levels in arterial compared with venous plasma suggest pulmonary production of endothelin-1, which may contribute to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.",479,0
"Evaluation of postprandial hyperemia in superior mesenteric artery and portal vein in healthy and cirrhotic humans: an operator-blind echo-Doppler study. In an operator-blind design, we used an echo-Doppler duplex system to examine superior mesenteric artery and portal vein hemodynamics on two consecutive mornings in 12 fasting cirrhotic patients and 12 matched controls, randomized to a standardized 355 kcal mixed-liquid meal vs. water. Cross-sectional area and mean velocity were recorded from the portal vein and superior mesenteric artery at 30 min intervals, from 0 min to 150 min after ingestion. Flows were calculated. Pulsatility index, an index related to vascular resistance, was obtained for the mesenteric artery. Baseline flows did not differ between cirrhotic patients and control patients, but pulsatility index was reduced in the cirrhotic subjects. Maximal postprandial hyperemia was attained at 30 min. Cirrhotic patients showed a blunted hyperemic response to food. In normal controls, portal vein area increased significantly after the meal from 30 min to 150 min, whereas in cirrhotic patients a significant difference occurred only at 30 min. Pulsatility index in both groups was significantly reduced after eating, and this reduction persisted up to 150 min. No changes after ingestion of water were observed. Echo-Doppler was very sensitive in detecting postprandial splanchnic hemodynamic changes and differences between cirrhotic patients and normal subjects. Mesenteric artery pulsatility index was more sensitive than flow in detecting baseline hemodynamic differences. In cirrhotic patients, portal postprandial hyperemia was mainly related to the increase in mean velocity.",360,0
"Positive selection of candidate tumor-suppressor genes by subtractive hybridization. A positive selection system designed to identify and recover candidate tumor-suppressor genes is described. The system compares mRNA expression of genes from normal and tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells grown in a special medium that supports similar growth rates of the two cell types. mRNAs uniquely expressed in normal cells are recovered as cDNAs after subtraction with mRNA from tumor cells. Seven different clones, from 0.6 to 4.8 kilobases in transcript size and including both rare and abundunt transcripts, were recovered in the first 23 clones analyzed. Among the isolated clones were genes encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26, two different keratins, and glutathione-S-transferase pi, as well as an unknown gene in the S100 family of small calcium-binding proteins. In principle, tumor-suppressor genes include two classes: class I, in which loss of function results from mutation or deletion of DNA and class II, in which loss of function is from a regulatory block to expression. A class II suppressor gene is assumed to be regulated by a different suppressor gene that lost its function by mutation or deletion. Both classes of tumor-suppressor genes may provide valuable proteins with clinical applications in cancer diagnosis or therapy. Class II suppressors may be especially useful because the normal genes are present and their reexpression may be inducible by drugs or other treatments.",296,1
"Magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of vena caval tumor thrombi: a comparative study with venacavography and computerized tomography scanning. We assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in demonstrating the presence and extent of vena caval tumor thrombi. The study group included 20 patients with vena caval thrombi from renal cell carcinoma (18), renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma (1) and adrenal pheochromocytoma (1). Preoperative diagnostic studies included magnetic resonance imaging in all patients, inferior venacavography in 16 and computerized tomography scanning in 15. All patients underwent an operation in which the presence and extent of the vena caval thrombus were confirmed. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately delineated the presence and extent of the thrombus in all 20 patients (100%). Venacavography was accurate in 15 patients (94%) but 8 (50%) required a retrograde and antegrade study. Computerized tomography scanning demonstrated the presence of a tumor thrombus in all 15 patients but accurately delineated the cephalad extent of the thrombus in only 5 (33%). In patients with vena caval tumor thrombi magnetic resonance imaging can provide accurate information regarding the extent of vena caval involvement while avoiding the need for an invasive contrast imaging study.",259,1
"Estrogen receptor localization in normal and neoplastic epithelium of the uterine cervix. To investigate the estrogen receptor (ER) status of cells during carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix, the immunohistochemical reactivity for a monoclonal anti-ER antibody (H 222) was studied in 26 normal cervical specimens, 21 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and 21 cases of invasive cervical carcinoma. In addition, the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA (types 6/11, 16/18, or 31/33/35) was analyzed by in situ hybridization. In the normal cervix, basal cells of the squamous epithelium, metaplastic cells, and endocervical glandular cells were ER positive. In contrast, neoplastic cells of CIN (17 of 21 cases) and invasive carcinoma (19 of 21 cases) were ER negative. The remaining four cases of CIN and two cases of invasive carcinoma were focally ER positive. The HPV DNA analysis revealed that HPV DNA in ER-negative cases was either types 16/18 or undetectable, but all ER-positive neoplasms contained HPV DNA types 31/33/35. These results suggest that most neoplastic cells in CIN and invasive cervical carcinoma lose their ER expression and that this may be related to the HPV DNA types which they possess.",292,1
"Photodynamic therapy in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Photodynamic therapy is an experimental modality for tumor treatment based on the combined action of the tumor-localizing agent, ie, hematoporphyrin derivative, and red light. From 1985 through 1989, 26 patients were treated using hematoporphyrin-derived drugs and 630-nm light delivered by a tunable dye laser. All patients had biopsy-proved squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and they had either failed the traditional treatment modalities or refused conventional therapies. Histological complete responses were achieved in 20 (77%) of 26 patients and partial responses in 5 (19%) of 26 patients for periods up to 48 months. Only minimal toxic reaction was noted in the group. As a guide to treatment planning for a patient group with large tumors, we used an optical dosimetry model based on tissue optics. The rate of complete responses to this treatment was 8 (73%) of 11. Our data indicate that photodynamic therapy is capable of inducing significant clinical and histological responses in the majority of those treated, and in some patients a prolonged response is produced. In certain select head and neck malignancies, photodynamic therapy has an important role as a treatment modality.",277,1
"Acupuncture and chronic pain: a criteria-based meta-analysis. A literature search revealed 51 controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic pain. These studies were reviewed using a list of 18 predefined methodological criteria. A maximum of 100 points for study design could be earned in four main categories: (a) comparability of prognosis, (b) adequate intervention, (c) adequate effect measurement and (d) data presentation. The quality of even the better studies proved to be mediocre. No study earned more than 62% of the maximum score. The results from the better studies (greater than or equal to 50% of the maximum score) are highly contradictory. The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain remains doubtful.",159,0
"Distinguishable types of dyspnea in patients with shortness of breath. Dyspnea frequently accompanies a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Although dyspnea is often considered a single sensation, alternatively it may encompass multiple sensations that are not well explained by a single physiologic mechanism. To investigate whether breathlessness experienced by patients represents more than one sensation, we studied 53 patients with one of the following seven conditions: pulmonary vascular disease, neuromuscular and chest wall disease, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, interstitial lung disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients were asked to choose descriptions of their sensation(s) of breathlessness from a dyspnea questionnaire listing 19 descriptors. Cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings among the chosen descriptors. We found that patients could distinguish different sensations of breathlessness. In addition, we found an association between certain groups of descriptors and specific conditions producing dyspnea. These findings concur with those in an earlier study in normal volunteers in whom dyspnea was induced by various stimuli. We conclude that different types of dyspnea exist in patients with a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Furthermore, different mechanisms may mediate these various sensations.",231,0
"Preperitoneal herniorrhaphy for the acutely incarcerated groin hernia. Elective preperitoneal or posterior repair for recurrent groin hernias and primary femoral hernias has been shown to be a technically advantageous approach. In addition to the ease of inguinal floor and femoral canal assessment, scar tissue from prior anterior herniorrhaphy can be avoided. The emergency management of the acutely incarcerated or strangulated hernia of the groin using this approach has not been addressed. During a 30-month period, all patients with a diagnosis of acute incarceration of a groin hernia (n = 28) were surgically managed using either the anterior approach (AA) (n = 14) or the preperitoneal approach (PA) (n = 14). Two patients with strangulated intestine in the AA group required an additional midline incision for bowel evaluation and resection. Intestinal evaluation was easily accomplished through the same incision in four patients in the PA group. The preperitoneal approach also allowed proximal control of incarcerated or strangulated viscera, thus avoiding excessive manipulation of gangrenous or necrotic intestine, potential spillage of infected contents into the peritoneal cavity, and entry of bacteria, toxins, potassium, and the metabolic waste products of anaerobic metabolism into the systemic circulation during hernia reduction. There have been no recurrences in either group, and minor complications, such as wound infection and cellulitis, in the two groups are not statistically different.",285,0
"Pharmacologic activity of bepafant (WEB 2170), a new and selective hetrazepinoic antagonist of platelet activating factor. The hetrazepine WEB 2170 (international nonproprietary name: bepafant), a thieno-triazolodiazepine that is structurally related to the recently described platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist WEB 2086, is a potent and selective PAF antagonist both in vitro and in vivo. WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced human platelet and neutrophil aggregation in vitro (IC50 values: 0.3 and 0.83 microM, respectively) but had little or no inhibitory action against aggregation induced by other agonists. The potency in vitro was comparable to that described recently for WEB 2086 (Casals-Stenzel, J., Muacevic, G. and Weber, K.H.: J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 241: 974-981, 1987). When guinea pigs were given i.v. infusions of PAF at 30 ng x kg-1 x min-1, oral (0.005-0.5 mg/kg) as well as intravenous (0.005-0.05 mg/kg) treatment with WEB 2170 abrogated the intrathoracic accumulation of 111In-labeled platelets, the bronchoconstriction and the hypotension as well as the finally occurring death in a dose-dependent fashion. Oral (0.01-1 mg/kg) and intravenous (0.005-0.1 mg/kg) WEB 2170 shared with the beta 2 agonist fenoterol and the steroid dexamethasone the property of protecting elderly NMRI mice from the lethal effect of PAF. In anesthetized rats, intravenous (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) and oral (0.05-1 mg/kg) WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced hypotension in a dose-related manner. Coadministration of WEB 2170 inhibited PAF-induced increase of vascular permeability in rat skin very effectively. The half-time of duration of action in the rat was estimated to be about 5 to 6 h after oral administration and about 1.1 to 2.3 h after intravenous application. In conclusion, the hetrazepine WEB 2170 is a strong and selective PAF antagonist, which is in vitro more or less equipotent to WEB 2086. In contrast, in vivo oral WEB 2170 is--depending on the species and considered parameter--about 5 to 40 times more potent against exogenous PAF-induced alterations than the recently described hetrazepine WEB 2086. Particularly in mice and rats, oral WEB 2170 is by far superior to WEB 2086.",629,0
"The headache-specific locus of control scale: adaptation to recurrent headaches. This paper describes the development, psychometric properties, and construct and incremental validity of a Headache-Specific Locus of Control Scale (HSLC). The HSLC is a 33 item scale designed specifically for recurrent headache sufferers. It assesses the individual's perceptions that headache problems and headache relief are determined primarily by: the individual's behavior (Internal factors), Health Care Professionals, or Chance factors. The psychometric properties of the HSLC were satisfactory. Among our findings were that: (1) the belief that headache problems and relief are determined by chance factors was associated with higher levels of depression, physical complaints, reliance on maladaptive pain coping strategies (p less than .001), and greater headache-related disability (p less than .01); (2) the belief that headache problems and relief are influenced primarily by the ministrations of health care professionals was associated with higher levels of medication use (p less than .01) and preference for medical treatment (p less than .001); and (3) the belief that headache problems are determined by the individual's responses and behaviors was associated with a preference for self-regulation treatment (p less than .01). These findings suggest adaptation to headache problems is influenced not only by the frequency and severity of the headache episodes, but by locus of control beliefs. The assessment of locus of control beliefs may provide useful information not typically obtained from standard medical evaluations.",303,0
"Infection during chronic epidural catheterization: diagnosis and treatment. A potentially serious complication of long-term epidural catheterization in cancer patients is infection. The early signs of infection were studied in 350 patients in whom long-term epidural catheters were inserted. Three areas of the catheter track were found to be involved; exit site and superficial catheter track infection, and epidural space infection. The authors identified the early signs of infection in each area and the progress of the infection from the deep track to include the epidural space in four of these patients. All 19 patients who developed deep track or epidural infections were successfully treated with antibiotics and catheter removal. None of the patients required surgery for spinal cord decompression. Catheters were replaced in 15 of the 19 treated patients who requested them after treatment with no recurrent infections. It was concluded that use of long-term epidural catheterization is associated with a definable epidural infection rate. The use of epidural opioid analgesia is an effective and safe means of obtaining pain relief for terminally ill patients when patients are monitored for possible infection and receive prompt treatment when the diagnosis is established.",238,1
"Screening for neuroblastoma at 3 weeks of age: methods and preliminary results from the Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project. A large neuroblastoma screening study was recently started in the province of Quebec, Canada. This project, a collaboration between the Quebec Network for Genetic Medicine and the University of Minnesota, is studying the impact of screening infants for the preclinical detection of neuroblastoma on the population-based mortality caused by this tumor. All infants born in Quebec during a 5-year period will be screened twice, at 3 weeks and at 6 months. Urinary homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid determination from dried filter paper samples is used for screening. Initial qualitative screening is done by means of thin-layer chromatography with confirmatory quantitative screening by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). During the initial 6 months of 3-week screening, 41,673 neonates (92% compliance rate) were screened and 10.6% of them were tested also by GC-MS. Nine of these neonates had positive results on two GC-MS tests and were referred for evaluation to rule out the presence of neuroblastoma. Four had the tumor, 1 had a calcified adrenal gland, and 4 had no tumor detected. Three additional neonates had clinical diagnosis of neuroblastoma before they reached the screening age of 3 weeks. A neuroblastoma that did not secrete homovanillic acid or vanillylmandelic acid was diagnosed clinically in 1 additional patient who tested negative by screening.",323,1
"Diagnosis of metastatic lesions to the stomach by salvage cytology. A report of three cases. Secondary neoplasms of the stomach are rare and are often clinical and diagnostic problems. Three patients with bleeding ""volcano-like"" ulcers were diagnosed by combined endoscopic ""salvage"" cytology and surgical biopsy as having metastatic submucosal lesions from hematologic spread. The combination of endoscopic appearance, clinical findings, and tissue and cytologic examination can lead to the correct diagnosis. The results from these cases support the utility of this cytologic technique in combination with biopsy in this clinical setting. ",117,1
"DNA analysis of multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas. The authors used retrospective quantitative DNA analysis to study interrelationships between multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas in seven patients. DNA content was determined by image analysis on Feulgen-stained nuclear smears prepared from multiple paraffin blocks from each tumor. Tumors were unilateral in four cases and bilateral in three. Ten tumors had homogeneous, and four heterogeneous DNA stemlines. Intertumoral heterogeneity in four cases suggested multifocal origin. Identical DNA aneuploid indices in bilateral tumors in one case suggested metastasis from a solitary origin. Abnormal DNA content and heterogeneous populations began to appear in the size range 2.0 to 5.0 cm. All tumors over 5.0 cm contained nondiploid populations. Although the interrelationships between these multiple synchronous neoplasms are not entirely clear, the DNA analysis suggests that the occurrence of nondiploid stemlines and heterogeneous DNA content may parallel both tumor growth and more aggressive behavior.",194,0
"Follow-up of infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for newborn respiratory failure. Follow-up studies were conducted to assess the medical and developmental outcome of 92 infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at the University of Michigan. Of 118 near-term (greater than 34 weeks' gestation) infants who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 103 (87%) were surviving and available for follow-up at between 1 and 7 years of age. Ninety-two of these children were seen on at least one occasion. Each visit included a history and physical examination, an evaluation by a physical therapist, and developmental testing by a pediatric psychologist. Medical outcome during year 1 found 31% of the children rehospitalized, primarily with respiratory illness. Outpatient-treated lower respiratory tract illness was seen in an additional 31% of the children. New or nonstatic neurologic problems were noted in 6% of the children. Abnormal growth during year 1 occurred in 26% of the children. At last clinic visit 16% of the children exhibited moderate-to-severe neurologic abnormalities, and 8% had moderate-to-severe cognitive delay. Sensorineural hearing loss occurred in 4% of children. Nine percent of the children were receiving speech and language therapy; screening tests showed that an additional 6% had speech and language delay. Overall, at last visit 16 (20%) of the children exhibited some type of handicap. A review of the literature on follow-up studies of non-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-treated infants with persistent pulmonary artery hypertension produced an impairment rate of 18.5%. Outcome post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation appears similar to that seen in less ill cohorts of infants treated with more ""conventional"" therapy. Long-term follow-up of all such infants remains essential.",395,0

Correlation between essential tremor and migraine headache. The relationship between essential tremor (ET) and migraine was investigated in a prospective study. In a group of 74 ET patients 36.5% had migraine compared with 17.7% of 102 control subjects without tremor. In a group of 58 patients with migraine 17.2% had ET compared with 1.2% of 85 controls without migraine. The prevalence of ET in migraine controls was greater than controls without migraine (22% compared with 1%; p = 0.002). It is concluded that there is an association between essential tremor and migraine.,139,0
"Multicentric endobronchial granular cell myoblastoma. Granular cell myoblastoma (GCM) is a rare benign neoplasm involving the tracheobronchial tree. It is believed to arise from the Schwann cell. Four cases of tracheobronchial GCM, all of which were multicentric, are presented and a conservative therapeutic approach is suggested. ",73,1
"Fractured and retained guide-wire fragment during coronary angioplasty--unforeseen late sequelae. During a difficult coronary angioplasty, the tip of the guide wire became inadvertently wedged in a distal vessel, fractured, and retained in situ. Because of the otherwise successful nature of the angioplasty and the patient's great risk for cardiac surgery, it was elected to leave the wire fragment in place. Recurrence of symptoms led to recatheterization, which in addition to restenosis of the original angioplasty site showed diffuse narrowing of the arterial segment that contained the retained wire fragment. This occurred despite systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin in the interval between procedures. Thus retained guide wire fragments in patent coronary arteries may cause arterial narrowing despite systemic anticoagulation. ",159,0
"Diet and female sex hormone concentrations: an intervention study for the type of fat consumed. A possible mechanism by which dietary fat may influence the development of breast cancer is by influencing the concentration of female sex hormones. This study investigated the effect of alteration in the type of fat consumed on concentrations of female sex hormones in serum. Female volunteers were randomly assigned to continue on their usual meat-eating diet, change to a vegetarian diet, or change to a diet that was predominantly vegetarian but where fish was consumed at least three times per week. Change to the vegetarian or fish diet had little effect on diet total hormone concentrations; however, the amount of estradiol was significantly decreased in the vegetarian group. When nutrient consumption was correlated with hormone concentrations, prolactin was directly associate with fat consumption, sex-hormone-binding globulin was inversely associated with fat consumption (particularly cholesterol consumption), and the proportion of nonprotein-bound estradiol was directly associated with complex carbohydrate consumption.

"von Willebrand factor in head and neck cancer. Laboratory abnormalities in blood coagulation factors are common in patients with cancer but the significance is unknown. Twenty-eight patients with head and neck cancer were studied at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-five were advanced-stage (III or IV) patients. Levels of clotting factors, antithrombin III, and plasminogen were normal. Levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF), both antigenic and functional (ristocetin cofactor), were elevated. This group of patients were followed for a minimum of 41 months (median, 48 months). Fifteen patients died within the follow-up period. von Willebrand factor levels were significantly higher in these 15 than the 13 survivors. Extreme elevation of ristocetin cofactor (greater than 300 U/dl) was seen in six of the 15 patients who died and in none of the survivors. Plasma vWF is elevated in head and neck cancer and the level measured at the time of diagnosis may have prognostic and potentially therapeutic implications.",219,1

"Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker.",137,0
"Relaxation training in school classes does not reduce headache complaints. The effect of teacher-presented Progressive Relaxation Training (PRT) on headaches, fear of failure and school problems was studied in school students. During ten physical education lessons, students received either PRT (n = 110) or placebo training (n = 92). The effect of the training was investigated in students who indicated the presence of headaches in a pre-training diary. No significant differences were found between both training groups regarding headache frequency, duration and intensity and the psychological variables. On the basis of these and previous findings, it is recommended to present PRT to fairly small groups of self-selected subjects instead of complete classes.",140,0
"Radiobiological studies in the naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. The naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is described in a 43-year-old male. The response of dividing fibroblasts from this patient to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation was indistinguishable from that of a normal control: mean inactivation dose (D) = 1.74 Gy and 1.68 Gy, respectively. However, these cells were defective in the repair of potentially lethal damage (D = 2.36 Gy and 3.26 Gy, respectively). The response to radiation of Go T lymphocytes derived from the patient was similar to that of the control. The frequency of mutant circulating T lymphocytes resistant to 6-thioguanine was 17 x 10(-6) which was elevated when compared with age-matched controls. These results suggest an abnormality in the response of the fibroblasts to ionizing radiation damage.",186,1
Epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma. Three cases of epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma are summarized and compared with reported cases.

"Is DNA ploidy of prognostic significance in stage I cutaneous melanoma? Recent studies have suggested that the presence of DNA aneuploidy in stage I cutaneous melanoma carries a poor prognosis. To see if our experience correlated with these reports, we used DNA analysis by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained nuclei disaggregated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of biopsy specimens to retrospectively study 55 patients who had cutaneous stage I melanomas. The patients had been treated from 1977 to 1987 with a mean follow-up of 5.4 years. Thirty-nine (71%) of the 55 histograms were diploid, and 16 (29%) of the histograms were aneuploid. DNA content was significantly associated with other conventional prognostic factors, including growth pattern, ulceration, pathologic stage, tumor thickness, and Clark's level. DNA aneuploidy was significantly related to disease-free survival and predicted a poorer prognosis (p less than 0.05), but when stratified for tumor thickness it lost significance. A multivariate discriminant function analysis of 12 factors in melanoma showed six factors to be independently significant in determining prognosis. DNA content (p = 0.034) ranked fifth in importance behind growth pattern (p less than 0.001), ulceration (p less than 0.001), thickness (p = 0.001), and pathologic stage (p less than 0.005). DNA content, although significantly associated with conventional prognostic factors and disease-free survival, is not the best indicator of biologic behavior of melanomas in this study. Further investigation into its usefulness is necessary before DNA content can become a routine diagnostic modality in the work-up of stage I cutaneous melanomas.",371,1
"Prognostic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma in the west: a multivariate analysis in 206 patients. To investigate the prognostic factors in Western patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 206 patients with confirmed diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma were studied in terms of survival. All patients were diagnosed between 1983 and 1987. A multivariate survival analysis (Cox regression model) using clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographical and pathological data obtained at diagnosis disclosed that bilirubin (p = 0.0001), ascites (p = 0.0001), toxic syndrome (defined by the presence of weight loss greater than 10% premorbid weight, malaise and anorexia) (p = 0.009), blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.025), tumor size (p = 0.001), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (p = 0.0006), age (p = 0.0005), serum sodium (p = 0.003) and presence of metastases (p = 0.002) were independent predictors of survival. According to the contribution of each of these factors to the final model, a prognostic index was constructed allowing division of patients in different groups according to their relative risk of death: RRD = EXP (Age x 0.03 + Ascites x 0.8281 + BUN x 0.0137 + Serum sodium x (-0.0538) + gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase x 0.0019 + Bilirubin x 0.0734 + Tumor size x 0.33 + Toxic syndrome x 0.4965 + Metastases x 0.55). These results facilitate the stratification of hepatocellular carcinoma patients to design and evaluate future controlled trials.",402,1
"The relationship of ""high risk"" mammographic patterns to histological risk factors for development of cancer in the human breast. In the UK Trial for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer in Nottingham, 119 women were identified as having fibrocystic change with epithelial hyperplasia or in situ carcinoma. Their mammograms were classified according to Wolfe's criteria and the corresponding histology for each patient was classified for degrees of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia and in situ neoplasia using Page's criteria. A control population of patients presenting for breast screening was used to represent the general population. No correlation was found between the four mammographic Wolfe patterns, N1, P1, P2 and DY and histological evidence of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia or in situ carcinoma. A further study was carried out to determine histological features of Wolfe pattern, using radiological examination of resected breast tissue. The variation in Wolfe pattern was related to the distribution of fibrous and adipose tissue in the breast interlobular stroma and appeared to have no relationship to epithelial parenchymal content. This information does not support the hypothesis that radiographic densities of P2 and DY patterns correspond to high risk epithelial proliferation.",233,1
"A cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone derived from mice with progressively growing tumors. Tumor-specific T-cell clones were derived from spleen cells of mice bearing a syngeneic PHS-5 tumor (a P815 mastocytoma mutant). Cells were expanded in vitro and characterized and assayed for activity against the relevant tumor in vivo. Clone cells were CD4-, CD8+ T lymphocytes, as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis and were specifically cytotoxic against P815 tumor cells in vitro, as shown in chromium 51 release assays. These cells require both antigen and interleukin 2 to proliferate; neither alone is sufficient, even with the addition of interleukin 1. In an experimental P815 liver metastasis model, the adoptive transfer of GD11 or GD11.17 clone cells and injection of recombinant interleukin 2 (7500 U intraperitoneally) 3 days after infusion of tumor cells reduced the number of tumor nodules, while the adoptive transfer of lymphokine-activated killer cells was ineffective.",217,1
"Hemodialysis for acute renal failure in patients with hematologic malignancies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognosis of patients with hematologic malignancies in acute renal failure who require hemodialysis. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: ICU. PATIENTS: Forty-three consecutive patients. METHODS: Prognostic analysis using both univariate and multivariate (stepwise regression) methods. RESULTS: Fifteen (35%) patients recovered from acute renal failure and 12 (28%) were discharged from the ICU. The prognosis of patients with acute renal failure linked to sepsis is poorer than the prognosis of the patients with acute renal failure from other etiologies. Only one patient survived in the former group (n = 26) and 11 in the latter group (n = 17); p less than .0001 in multivariate analysis. When accompanied by associated respiratory failure, mortality rate was higher (93% vs. 33%; p less than .0001). The Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) calculated within the first 24 hr of admission was significantly (p less than .001) related to mortality when the SAPS was greater than or equal to 13. The presence of neutropenia and the type of hematologic malignancy were not related to a worse prognosis. Tolerance to hemodialysis appeared good, and complications were rare.",283,1
"Endoscopic ultrasonography for the evaluation of smooth muscle tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract: an experience with 42 cases. Before surgery, 12 patients with suspected leiomyoma and 12 patients with suspected leiomyosarcoma were studied by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), endoscopy, and barium swallow. The results were correlated with surgery and histology. Ten leiomyomas, one benign gastric ulcer, one carcinoid metastasis, eight leiomyosarcomas, two leiomyoblastomas, one mucus secreting adenocarcinoma, and one bronchial carcinoma were diagnosed. Eighteen additional patients suspected to have benign submucosal lesions by endoscopy and barium meal were treated non-surgically, and studied by EUS and CT. EUS was superior to other imaging techniques in the detection, staging, and follow-up of submucosal smooth muscle tumors because of clear imaging of the intramural abnormality and adjacent lymph nodes.",200,1
"Quantitative assessment of cerebral blood volume by single-photon emission computed tomography. We implemented a technique for measuring regional cerebral blood volume using single-photon emission computed tomography and in vivo technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells and then evaluated it in nine normal human volunteers (controls) and seven patients with bilateral occlusion or severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery. We also measured regional cerebral blood flow using single-photon emission computed tomography and intravenous xenon-133 in the same subjects. We studied regional cerebral blood flow, regional cerebral blood volume, and their ratio before and after the intravenous injection of 1 g acetazolamide. Mean +/- SD baseline regional cerebral blood volume was higher in the patients than in the controls (4.1 +/- 0.6 versus 3.2 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g, p less than 0.01), and mean +/- SD baseline regional cerebral blood flow was lower in the patients than in the controls (40.5 +/- 11 versus 55.6 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.05). Acetazolamide induced similar mean +/- SD increases in regional cerebral blood volume in both the controls and the patients (0.3 +/- 0.1 and 0.3 +/- 0.2 ml/100 g), while the mean +/- SD regional cerebral blood flow reactivity was significantly less in the patients than in the controls (12.6 +/- 7.6 versus 24.5 +/- 9.6 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.05). Our study shows that single-photon emission computed tomography can provide quantitative estimates of both regional cerebral blood volume and regional cerebral blood flow in humans.",372,0
"The auditory P300 event-related potential: an objective marker of the encephalopathy of chronic liver disease. Recently many variants of electroencephalogram-evoked responses have been studied as potential diagnostic aids in the detection and evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy. This study assesses the value of the auditory P300 event-related potential--a slow component of the auditory evoked response--as a tool in this field. Twenty-one nonencephalopathic and 12 encephalopathic (grade 1/2) cirrhotic patients and 26 controls were assessed clinically and psychometrically. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis and visual evoked response recordings were also conducted. An auditory P300 wave was elicited using the standard two-tone discrimination paradigm. The latency and amplitude of this wave were measured. The latency of the P300 was found to be significantly increased in the encephalopathic patients compared with both nonencephalopathic cirrhotic and control groups (p less than 0.05). Amplitude of the wave was decreased in both nonencephalopathic and encephalopathic patients, but this was not statistically significant. This study suggests that the latency of the P300 is a good marker of grades 1 and 2 clinical hepatic encephalopathy. The delays in the P300 latency may indicate that encephalopathic patients have a deterioration of their stimulus evaluation abilities.",283,0
"Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of treatment. In 58 breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) pretreatment characteristics, clinical course, and response to treatment were evaluated. Forty-four patients were uniformly treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Fourteen patients did not receive intraventricular treatment. In the intraventricularly treated group the median survival was 12 weeks. Multivariate analysis of the pretreatment characteristics of the intraventricularly treated patients demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to survival for age older than 55 years, lung metastases, cranial nerve involvement, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose less than 2.5 mmol/l, and CSF protein 0.51 to 1.0 g/l. Based on the significance of these predicting factors a prognostic index (PI) identified four groups of patients with a median survival of 43 weeks, 22 weeks, 11 weeks, and 3 weeks, respectively. After 6 weeks of intraventricular treatment 22 patients showed a neurologic improvement or stabilization, and nine patients showed a worsening of the neurologic signs, whereas 13 patients (30%) had already died. The responders had a median additional survival of 5 months versus 1 month for nonresponders. No relation was found between survival and intensity of the intraventricular treatment after the first 6 weeks of treatment. Almost all long survivors had also received systemic treatment for systemic disease, whereas most patients who died within 6 months did not receive systemic therapy. Radiation therapy had no influence on the survival time. Early death due to the intensive treatment occurred in three patients. In 11 of the 17 patients who survived more than 4 months an often seriously debilitating late neurotoxicity developed. The survival curve of the nonintraventricularly treated patients appeared to be essentially the same as the curve of the intraventricularly treated patients. Using the same PI the predicted survival time was also the same as in the intraventricularly treated group. It is concluded that survival in MC from breast carcinoma may be more dependent on some pretreatment characteristics than on treatment intensity. On the basis of these pretreatment characteristics the survival time seems to be predictable. Finally, late neurotoxicity due to aggressive treatment leads to impairment of the quality of life in more than 50% of the long survivors. The exact value of intraventricular and systemic therapy in patients with MC still has to be determined.",501,1
"Sexual and physical abuse in women with functional or organic gastrointestinal disorders. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of a history of sexual and physical abuse in women seen in a referral-based gastroenterology practice, to determine whether patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders report greater frequencies of abuse than do patients with organic gastrointestinal diseases, and to determine whether a history of abuse is associated with more symptom reporting and health care utilization. DESIGN: A consecutive sample of women seen in a university-based gastroenterology practice over a 2-month period was asked to complete a brief questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS: The self-administered questionnaire requested information about demographics, symptoms, health care utilization, and history of abuse. Physicians indicated the primary diagnosis for each patient and whether she had ever discussed having been sexually or physically abused. RESULTS: Of 206 patients, 89 (44%) reported a history of sexual or physical abuse in childhood or later in life; all but 1 of the physically abused patients had been sexually abused. Almost one third of the abused patients had never discussed their experiences with anyone; only 17% had informed their doctors. Patients with functional disorders were more likely than those with organic disease diagnoses to report a history of forced intercourse (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.21) and frequent physical abuse (odds ratio, 11.39; CI, 2.22 to 58.48), chronic or recurrent abdominal pain (odds ratio, 2.06; CI, 1.03 to 4.12), and more lifetime surgeries (2.7 compared with 2.0 surgeries; P less than 0.03). Abused patients were more likely than nonabused patients to report pelvic pain (odds ratio, 4.05; CI, 1.41 to 11.69), multiple somatic symptoms (7.1 compared with 5.8 symptoms; P less than 0.001), and more lifetime surgeries (2.8 compared with 2.0 surgeries; P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a history of sexual and physical abuse is a frequent, yet hidden, experience in women seen in referral-based gastroenterology practice and is particularly common in those with functional gastrointestinal disorders. A history of abuse, regardless of diagnosis, is associated with greater risk for symptom reporting and lifetime surgeries.",514,0
"Modified Kraske approach for disease of the mid-rectum. A modification of Dr. Paul Kraske's approach for removal of mid-rectal lesions has been used in 11 patients from 1977 to 1988 by the senior authors. Patients ranged in age from 56 to 89 yr, with an average of 67 yr. There were seven male and four female patients. Indications for surgery were as follows: villous adenoma (seven), carcinoid (one), recurrent dysplasia in a previous endoscopic polypectomy site (one), positive distal margin for neoplasm following low anterior sigmoid resection (one), and adenocarcinoma in one elderly poor-risk patient. All lesions were in the middle rectum (7-11 cm from the anal verge, average 9 cm). The postoperative stay ranged from 6 to 12 days with a mean of 8 days. The average follow-up for the 11 patients is 3 1/2 yr (1 month to 7 yr), with only one patient having a local recurrent lesion. There was no morbidity or mortality. We conclude that this modification of the Kraske approach offers a good alternative for excision of mid-rectal lesions in terms of technical ease, efficacy, safety, and patient tolerance. The modified Kraske approach is indicated in certain situations and should be a part of the surgeon's armamentarium.",290,0
"Preoperative chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil) and radiation therapy in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase II study of the Lung Cancer Study Group. The Lung Cancer Study Group conducted a phase II pilot study of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) before surgery in 85 eligible patients with non-small-cell cancer limited to the chest but in whom attempted resection would have been likely to leave residual disease (advanced stage IIIA and minimal stage IIIB disease). Cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 29; fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per 24 hours, was administered as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 4 and on days 29 through 32; and thoracic radiation, 30 Gy in 15 fractions, was administered on days 1 through 19. Two patients achieved a complete response and 46 patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 56%. Toxicity from chemoradiotherapy was moderate but acceptable. Eight weeks after therapy was initiated, 54 patients underwent thoracotomy and tumor resection was attempted: 29 (34%) had complete resection and 15 (18%) had incomplete resection. Although surgical dissection was generally more difficult than in patients not pretreated with chemoradiotherapy, there was no apparent increase in postoperative complications. In 8 patients (9%), no viable tumor was detected pathologically in the resection specimen. Of the 18 patients whose tumors were completely resected and had disease recurrence, none had recurrence only in the chest, 12 (67%) had recurrence only in distant sites, and 3 developed second primary tumors. Median survival of all patients was 13 months. The overall results do not indicate a major benefit from this preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen in patients with advanced but potentially resectable non-small-cell lung cancer. These results suggest a need to define better the relative roles of preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.",427,1
"Tissue distribution of 2-3 and 2-6 sialyl Lewis A antigens and significance of the ratio of two antigens for the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign disorders of the digestive tract. The authors investigated the tissue distribution of two kinds of sialylated derivatives of Lewis A (Le(a)) antigen in patients with cancers of the digestive system using specific monoclonal antibodies, and evaluated the significance of determining the 2-3 and 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen levels for the diagnosis of cancer. In most specimens from patients with cancers of the pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon, the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was strongly expressed in cancer cells. However, 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen was less frequently expressed in cancer cells. The former is therefore more specific to cancer than the latter. Also, the serum level of the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was significantly higher than that of the 2-6 counterpart in patients with cancers of pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon. The resulting ratio of serum 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigens was frequently high in patients with malignancy and was low in patients with benign disorders of these digestive organs. Therefore, the 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen ratio is a useful for the differential diagnosis of malignant disorders in these organs. However, liver disorders were found to be exceptional in that both antigens were mostly absent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in immunohistologic examination, as well as in nonmalignant parenchymal liver cells. Only the epithelial cells of the intrahepatic bile ducts expressed the 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen strongly, and expressed the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen moderately. The levels of both antigens were sometimes high in patients with liver disorders, but the ratio always remained low in patients with HCC as well as benign liver disorders such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. The sialylated Le(a) antigens, which sometimes accumulate in the sera of patients with HCC, were concluded to originate from the epithelial cells of the proliferating small bile ducts, and those serum antigens cannot be considered as evidence for the presence of liver cancer cells.",479,1
"Paraplegia after a routine lumbar laminectomy: report of a rare complication and successful management. Arachnoid cysts of the spinal canal are relatively common lesions that may be either intra- or extradural. These cysts are usually asymptomatic but may produce symptoms by compressing the spinal cord or nerve roots. We report a case in which an intradural thoracic arachnoid cyst became symptomatic after a routine decompressive lumbar laminectomy for spinal stenosis. Myelography revealed no abnormality, although magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography after myelography demonstrated a mass within the posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal canal associated with anterior displacement and compression of the spinal cord. A change in the flow dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid probably allowed the development of spinal cord compression due to one of the following: expansion of the cyst, decreased cerebrospinal fluid buffer between the cord and the cyst, or epidural venous engorgement. A concomitant and more cephalad lesion such as an arachnoid cyst should be considered when myelopathic complications arise after lumbar surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography after myelography are useful to demonstrate the additional pathological processes. ",226,0
"Clinical study of intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumors producing alpha-fetoprotein. We present six patients with intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumors that produced alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Their ages ranged from 8 to 20 years (average, 11.5 years old); two were male and four were female. Four of the tumors originated in the pineal region and two in the suprachiasmatic region. One patient treated with only radiation therapy died within 3 months of admission as a result of intraperitoneal metastasis via a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Another patient, treated with radiation therapy and intrathecal administration of neocarzinostatin, died after 12 months because of tumor progression and subarachnoid dissemination. Two patients who received radiation and combination therapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin died after 13 and 25 months. The remaining two patients treated with radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide) are now alive without recurrence after 16 and 19 months from admission. Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide appears to be efficacious in the treatment of intracranial nongerminomatous germ cell tumor.",249,1

"Percutaneous angioscopy during coronary angioplasty using a steerable microangioscope. The feasibility of using a flexible, steerable angioscope to perform coronary angioscopy before and after percutaneous coronary angioplasty was tested. The microangioscope fits through an 8F coronary angioplasty guiding catheter and contains a multifiber viewing bundle incorporated into the body of a 4.3F balloon catheter with a central lumen for distal flushing and guide-wire passage. Angioscopy was performed without complications 45 times in 24 patients, including 6 patients with stable and 18 with unstable angina. Circumferential visualization of the target lesion was successful in 20 (83%) of the 24 patients and improved with operator experience. Excellent visualization of the target lesion was achieved in 16 (94%) of the last 17 patients. Plaque, thrombus and dissection were among the abnormal findings in the 20 patients (4 with stable, 16 with unstable angina) in whom circumferential viewing of the target lesion was achieved. In four patients with restenosis after angioplasty, the lesion morphology was distinctly different from that of lesions in arteries without prior angioplasty. In patients with stable angina, no thrombus or dissection was seen by angiography or angioscopy before angioplasty. In patients with unstable angina, thrombus was detected more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (8 versus 2 of 16) and after (15 versus 2 of 16) angioplasty. Intimal dissection was also seen much more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (7 versus 0 of 16) and after angioplasty (16 versus 7 of 16). It is concluded that high resolution percutaneous coronary angioscopy can be performed safely in conjunction with balloon angioplasty. Further investigation is needed before this diagnostic tool can be applied clinically.",412,0
"Ewing's sarcoma. Radiotherapy versus surgery for local control. Significant strides in the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma, the second most common bone tumor of childhood, have resulted in cure for approximately 50% of patients. Successful therapy requires systemic chemotherapy for the eradication of microscopic or overt metastatic disease and surgery or irradiation therapy for control of the primary lesion. The article debates the controversy over the extent to which surgical resection should play a role in the local management of this disease.",98,1
"Obesity, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and response to antihypertensive drugs. Responsiveness to antihypertensive medications was investigated cross-sectionally in 559 individuals comprising all treated hypertensive patients identified within a representative sample (n = 3,532, aged 40-70 years) of the Jewish population in Israel. A rate of dosage score (a summed ranking of dosages of all drugs taken) of two or more increased significantly with increasing levels of body mass index (BMI) from 37.5% in levels less than 23, 54.9% in levels 23.0-29.9, and 76.4% in levels of 30 or greater (p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analyses, adjusting for age, gender, arm circumference, and ethnic group, confirmed the independent effect of BMI on dosage score (p less than 0.001). At each level of dosage score, mean blood pressure levels were equivalent at all levels of BMI after adjusting for potential confounders. This indicates that achieved blood pressure level and not BMI itself was the main determinant of the higher dosing regimens prescribed at higher levels of BMI. In representative subgroups, glucose tolerance (n = 372) and hyperinsulinemia (n = 190) were determined and were found to be positively associated with a dosage score of two or more (p less than 0.05) independently of BMI. These effects could not be accounted for by poor compliance or by altered drug absorption or disposition since overnight urinary drug excretion and plasma drug concentrations 2 hours after ingestion, measured in 80 randomly selected patients from the study group, were not different across BMI categories at similar dosages.",371,0
"Psychological outcomes of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer outside a clinical trial OBJECTIVES--To assess outside a clinical trial the psychological outcome of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer who underwent either mastectomy or breast conservation surgery depending on the surgeon's opinion or the patient's choice. To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. DESIGN--Prospective, multicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. SETTING--12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. PATIENTS--269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of stage I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. INTERVENTIONS--Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS--Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study.) CONCLUSIONS--There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial.",678,1
"Significance of magnetic resonance imaging in acute head injury. One hundred seventy-seven patients who had incurred head trauma were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients varied from those with mild injury without any focal neurological deficit to those with severe injury with post-traumatic coma. Altogether, 177 lesions were demonstrated by MRI in 123 of 177 patients within 3 days of injury using T2-weighted (SE2000/40,2000/111) and T1-weighted (IR1500/500/40) multislice sequences. In contrast, computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated 103 lesions in 90 patients. MRI was superior to CT in the diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic contusions demonstrated as a high-intensity area on T2-weighted imaging. MRI provided some information to evaluate the severity of diffuse axonal injury or to predict delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma (DTICH).",206,0
"Screening colonoscopy in asymptomatic average-risk persons with negative fecal occult blood tests. Colonoscopy was performed on 210 asymptomatic average-risk persons, aged 50-75 years, who had negative fecal occult blood test results. Colonoscopy was complete to the cecum in 209 subjects. Fifty-three subjects (25%) had adenomas and two had cancer. All of the adenomas greater than or equal to 1 cm in size and both cancers occurred in subjects aged greater than or equal to 60 years. Fifty-one percent of subjects with adenomas and one with cancer had no neoplasms distal to the sigmoid-descending colon junction. One subject had a major postpolypectomy hemorrhage that stopped spontaneously. Screening colonoscopy, therefore, has a high yield for detection of neoplasms in asymptomatic average-risk persons aged greater than or equal to 60 years with negative fecal occult blood test results. The yield is low in persons aged 50-54 years and intermediate in persons aged 55-59 years.",219,1
"Inflammatory pseudotumor of intra-abdominal lymph nodes manifesting as recurrent fever of unknown origin: a case report. A 27-year-old man presented with a 7-month history of debilitating recurrent fever and weight loss. Extensive clinical evaluation led to the discovery of splenomegaly and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent splenectomy as well as liver and lymph node biopsy. Histologic examination of the lymph nodes, but not the liver and spleen, revealed inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes. The patient has remained asymptomatic for more than 3 years following the surgical procedure despite the absence of further intervention. Inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes should be considered in the differential evaluation of prolonged or relapsing fever of unknown etiology.",153,1

"The role of beta-blockade therapy for ventricular tachycardia induced with isoproterenol: a prospective analysis. Isoproterenol is sometimes required for ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction. However, the role of beta-blockade for treatment of such VT has not been critically assessed. The use of beta-blockade was evaluated prospectively in 14 consecutive patients who required isoproterenol 2.4 +/- 1.3 (+/- S.D.) micrograms/min to induce sustained monomorphic VT (greater than 30 seconds, or requiring termination due to hemodynamic collapse) after a negative baseline study. The VT mechanisms were enhanced automaticity (group A, six patients), triggered automaticity (group B, three patients), and reentry (group C, five patients). Groups A and B had serial intravenous electropharmacologic tests with propranolol alone (0.2 mg/kg), verapamil alone (0.15 mg/kg), and propranolol plus verapamil, and group C had serial tests with propranolol alone, procainamide or quinidine (class Ia drug) alone, and propranolol plus a class Ia drug until VT could no longer be induced. All six patients in group A responded to propranolol alone. In group B, one patient responded to verapamil alone, and two patients responded to propranolol plus verapamil. In group C, three patients responded to propranolol alone, one patient responded to a class Ia drug alone, and one patient responded to propranolol plus a class Ia drug. During a follow-up of 7 to 37 (17.9 +/- 10.7) (+/- S.D.) months, VT has not recurred in any patient. Three patients treated initially with propranolol alone have required substitution of amiodarone due to refractory congestive heart failure. In patients requiring isoproterenol for VT induction, beta-blockade alone appears to be effective in preventing reinduction of VT caused by enhanced automaticity. A heterogeneous response occurs when the VT mechanisms are triggered automaticity or reentry.",442,0
"Duodenogastric reflux and gastric histology after cholecystectomy with or without sphincteroplasty. Sixteen patients who had undergone cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty, 14 cholecystectomized patients and ten control patients were studied to evaluate whether differences existed in duodenogastric reflux and whether these were related to morphological damage of the gastric mucosa. Duodenogastric bile reflux during fasting was evaluated by measuring the concentration of total bile acids (by an enzymatic method) and single bile acids in the gastric juice by high performance liquid chromatography. The damage was evaluated histologically by systematic endoscopic biopsy of the antrum and body of the stomach. There was a statistically significant difference in fasting bile reflux between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P less than 0.001), and the group that underwent cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty had a significantly higher median value than the cholecystectomized group (P less than 0.05) and the control group (P less than 0.01). The distribution of chronic antral atrophic and superficial gastritis was different in the three groups (chi 2 test, P less than 0.005). Chronic atrophic gastritis was associated with cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty (P less than 0.01), while chronic superficial gastritis was more frequent in cholecystectomized patients. These results suggest that there may be more duodenogastric reflux after cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty than after cholecystectomy alone, and that there may be a correlation between the amount of duodenogastric reflux and the severity of mucosal damage.",347,0

"Enveloping the bladder with displacement of flap of the rectus abdominis muscle for the treatment of neurogenic bladder. Neurogenic bladder is a frequent occurrence. A new surgical technique has been designed and was used successfully in 18 patients with ideal results. The key point of the operation is to turn over a flap of rectus abdominis muscle to envelop the bladder. Contraction of the muscle flap and the abdominal muscles would enhance voiding ability. In the meantime, the bladder is displaced forward and the resultant change in the bladder-posterior urethral angle also favors voiding. Since the bladder is near the anterior abdominal wall manual compression during voiding is made easier. All of these advantages greatly facilitate voiding.",147,0
"Lateral temporal bone resections. Eighteen consecutive patients underwent a lateral temporal bone resection for the treatment of tumors originating in the auricle, the external auditory canal, the periauricular skin, or the parotid and were retrospectively analyzed. The different lateral temporal bone resections performed have been categorized into four types. The type I resection consists of the removal of the tympanic bone and the external auditory canal lateral to the tympanic membrane. The type II resection consists of the removal of the entire tympanic bone, the tympanic membrane, the incus, and the malleus, preserving the facial nerve and the inner ear. Type III resections remove, in addition to the those structures removed in type II resections, the distal facial nerve and fallopian canal, the mastoid tip, the styloid process, and the stylomastoid foramen. The type IV resection consists of the removal of only the mastoid tip and the inferior portion of the tympanic bone. When the techniques of lateral temporal bone resection are used appropriately, adequate surgical treatment of patients with selected advanced and recurrent malignant tumors of the external ear, the periauricular skin, and the parotid is possible with low morbidity and a high probability of local regional control.

"Noncoordinate regulation of alpha-1 adrenoreceptor coupling and reexpression of alpha skeletal actin in myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure in rats. To determine the effects of myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure on the regulation of surface alpha-1 adrenoreceptors and signal transduction, large infarcts were produced in rats and the animals killed seven days later. After the documentation of impaired left ventricular pump performance, radioligand binding studies of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor, norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositol turnover, and ADP ribosylation of 41 kD substrate by pertussis toxin were examined in the hypertrophying unaffected myocardium. Moreover, the expression of sarcomeric actin isoforms was analyzed by Northern blots and hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. Alpha-1 adrenoreceptor density was found not to be altered in membranes obtained from the spared left ventricular tissue, whereas phosphoinositol turnover was increased 3.1-fold in the viable myocytes of infarcted hearts. Furthermore, pertussis toxin substrate was augmented 2.5-fold in membranes prepared from the surviving left ventricular myocardium. Finally, an upregulation of the skeletal actin isoform was detected in the tissue of the failing left ventricle. In conclusion, the possibility is raised that in the presence of severe myocardial dysfunction and ongoing reactive hypertrophy, effector pathways linked to the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor may stimulate the myocyte hypertrophic response which would tend to normalize cardiac hemodynamics. The reexpression of alpha skeletal actin may be a molecular indicator of the persistance of an overload on the myocardium.",320,0
"Transient entrapment neuropathy of the posterior interosseous nerve in violin players. Eleven white male right handed violin players complained of transient muscular deficit of the extensor compartment of the left forearm during and after prolonged playing. This was associated with paraesthesiae and pain. Relief was achieved keeping the wrist and the elbow flexed, with the supinated forearm held by the contralateral hand. An anatomical study showed changes of the relationship of the posterior interosseous nerve with its surrounding structures with pronation and supination of the forearm. On the basis of the clinical features, the anatomical studies and the response to a simple physiotherapeutic regime, it is suggested that prolonged pronation of the forearm may cause transient entrapment of the nerve.

"Implementation of cancer prevention guidelines in clinical practice. Data from several sources, including consumer surveys, physician surveys, and medical record audits, indicate that consumers do not receive cancer screening tests as recommended by the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Performance rates are consistently below published standards for all tests except Pap tests. Major reasons physicians do not perform the recommended tests include physician forgetfulness, disagreement with recommendations, lack of time, and patient refusal. Physicians also tend to overestimate their own performance rates. Barriers to screening test performance can be categorized into patient factors, physician factors, test factors, and health care delivery system factors. Interventions, such as computerized reminder systems, physician audits with feedback, and patient education and reminders, can be effective in promoting performance of such screening. Interventions that target both physician and patient may be particularly effective. ",178,1
"Immunoscintigraphy of ovarian cancer with indium-111-labeled OV-TL 3 F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody. The safety and diagnostic accuracy of immunoscintigraphy with the indium-111-labeled monoclonal antibody OV-TL 3 F(ab')2(111In-OV-TL 3 F(ab')2) for diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer was prospectively studied in 31 patients. Planar and SPECT scintigraphy were performed up to 4 days after i.v. injection of 140 MBq 111In-OV-TL 3 F(ab')2. Surgical evaluation was possible in 22 out of 31 patients. Imaging results were compared with X-ray computed tomography, ultrasound, and CA 125 serum level using the histologically confirmed surgical findings as a ""gold standard."" Apart from a transient rash observed in two patients, no other immediate or delayed adverse reactions were observed. Within the surgically evaluated group, ovarian cancer lesions were detected in 16 out of 17 patients (94%). Of 45 distinct tumor deposits found at operation, 67% were detected and localized with immunoscintigraphy while X-ray computed tomography and ultrasound visualized 53% and 23%, respectively.",281,1
"Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score in patients with cerebrovascular disease and in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity in peripheral blood was determined in 54 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), 11 patients with primary brain tumor, and 23 patients with metastatic brain tumor. The LAP score of the primary brain tumor patients (155 +/- 40) was significantly higher (P less than 0.03) than the LAP score for cerebrovascular disease patients (96 +/- 87). The LAP score levels of the metastatic brain tumor patients (251 +/- 55) was significantly higher as compared with both the cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.001) and primary brain tumor groups (P less than 0.001). The LAP score could serve as an additional, although non-specific, marker to assist in the differentiation between cerebrovascular disease and brain tumors.",200,0
"Selective G to T mutations of p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma from southern Africa Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent cancer in sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Asia. Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxins are risk factors for HCC, but the molecular mechanism of human hepatocellular carcinogenesis is largely unknown. Abnormalities in the structure and expression of the tumour-suppressor gene p53 are frequent in HCC cell lines, and allelic losses from chromosome 17p have been found in HCCs from China and Japan. Here we report on allelic deletions from chromosome 17p and mutations of the p53 gene found in 50% of primary HCCs from southern Africa. Four of five mutations detected were G----T substitutions, with clustering at codon 249. This mutation specificity could reflect exposure to a specific carcinogen, one candidate being aflatoxin B1 (ref. 7), a food contaminant in Africa, which is both a mutagen that induces G to T substitution and a liver-specific carcinogen.",215,1
Prostate-specific antigen for staging prior to surgery and for early detection of recurrence after surgery.

"Rural-urban differences in stage at diagnosis. Possible relationship to cancer screening. Stage at diagnosis was examined for various malignancies identifiable through screening to determine whether rural-urban differences exist in Georgia. Data were obtained from a population-based cancer registry which registers all incident cancers among residents of metropolitan Atlanta and ten neighboring rural counties. Black and white patients with a first primary invasive malignancy newly diagnosed between 1978 and 1985 were included in this study. Residents of the rural area were twice as likely to have unstaged cancers (18.3%) as were urban residents (9.6%). Among patients with known stage at diagnosis, rural patients tended to have more advanced disease than urban patients. The relative excess of nonlocalized malignancies in rural Georgia was 21% for whites and 37% for blacks. The rural excess of nonlocalized prostate cancer among blacks was especially pronounced. Differences in access to or utilization of early detection methods may contribute to the rural-urban differential in the extent of disease at diagnosis.",211,1
"Scintigraphic assessment of leukocyte infiltration in acute pancreatitis using technetium-99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine as leukocyte label. The infiltration of leukocytes has been linked to the pathophysiology of complicated or severe pancreatitis. We have tested the ability of leukocyte scintigraphy using technetium-99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine (HM-PAO) as label to demonstrate the localization of leukocytes in the pancreas during acute pancreatitis. Twenty-eight patients with acute pancreatitis (eight with biliary, 13 with alcoholic, and seven with unknown origin) were studied with leukocyte scintigraphy using planar imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Fourteen patients had a mild (group I), II a severe (group II), and three a lethal outcome (group III) of pancreatitis. All patients of group III, six of group II, and two of group I had a positive leukocyte scan. Thus, the sensitivity of leukocyte scintigraphy for the detection of a lethal course of acute pancreatitis was 100%, of a severe course 54%, and of a severe or lethal course 64%. The specificity of a negative scan for a mild pancreatitis was 86%. Comparison of the results of leukocyte scintigraphy with those of contrast enhanced CT showed that six of eight patients with pancreatic necrosis in CT had a positive leukocyte scan, but only five of 20 patients without detectable pancreatic necrosis in CT. In summary, leukocyte infiltration into the pancreas during pancreatitis can be demonstrated by noninvasive leukocyte scintigraphy using technetium-99m-HM-PAO as label. A correlation between the severity of the disease and leukocyte infiltration exists.",359,0

"Plasma neurotransmitters and cortisol in duodenal ulcer patients. Role of stress. Levels of noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, free serotonin, platelet serotonin, and cortisol were measured in the plasma of duodenal ulcer patients and controls. All subjects received antacids, and these substances were also measured. During relapse, all patients showed raised noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol values. In contrast, platelet serotonin showed very low values, which correlated negatively with all the former, except free serotonin. No correlations were found in parameters of the controls. After healing, significant reductions of noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol and significant increases of platelet serotonin values were observed. However, only dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol reached normal values. Noradrenaline and adrenaline remained higher and platelet serotonin lower, both significantly more so than normals. These still-altered parameters showed similar correlations to those found during relapses. The present results demonstrate that some baseline autonomic system imbalance exists in patients, amplified and accentuated during relapse. We discuss the possibility that stress plays some role in triggering duodenal ulcer relapse. ",228,0
"Immunocytochemical localization of progesterone receptors in endocrine cells of the human pancreas. Progesterone receptors (PgR) have been immunocytochemically localized in the nuclei of several (40% to 75%) endocrine cells of the human pancreas and in a more variable number of neoplastic cells of 7 of 18 endocrine pancreatic tumors. Conversely the exocrine epithelial cells of the pancreas did not exhibit any PgR immunoreactivity in normal as well as in different pathologic conditions, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Estrogen receptors were not detected in any of the pancreatic samples investigated. Double immunocytochemical experiments have documented that PgR immunoreactivity in normal Langerhans islets is a consistent feature of most (75%) glucagon-producing A cells, of approximately 5% to 20% of insulin-producing B cells, and of a variable percentage of pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-producing cells, ranging from 5% to 70%. These figures were not affected by the sex, age, or underlying disease of the patients. The reported findings corroborate previous clinical and experimental evidence indicating that sex steroid hormones may have some regulatory effects on the functional activity of the endocrine pancreas.",244,1
"Raised urinary secretory IgA in chronic diarrhoea. Secretory IgA outputs in urine have been measured in 24 malnourished Gambian children who had been admitted to hospital with chronic diarrhoea and in 43 children from a rural Gambian village. Village children of poor nutritional state (less than or equal to 74% weight for age compared with the National Center for Health Statistics reference curve) had secretory IgA outputs that were only one third of those of better nourished individuals. In contrast, the patients with chronic diarrhoea had secretory IgA outputs that were significantly raised compared with village children, regardless of nutritional state. These results demonstrate that secretory IgA production in the urinary tract can be stimulated by intestinal disease, suggesting that malnourished children are able to mount a response to mucosal infection and supporting the hypothesis of a common secretory immune system.",164,0

We present a rare case of carcinosarcoma (malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma) of the left maxilla that developed in a 63-year-old Japanese man. The tumor recurred repeatedly despite multiple surgical removals, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy and led to progressive cachexia; the patient died after 3.8 years of hospitalization. Histopathologic examination revealed that the recurrent tumor was carcinosarcoma, which had progressed from malignant ameloblastoma with fibroma.

"Pulmonary metastases and bone sarcomas. Surgical removal of lesions appearing after adjuvant chemotherapy. Pulmonary metastasis is the leading cause of death in pediatric patients with bone tumors. Multiple thoracotomies for surgical removal of individual lesions are performed at many centers. To explore the efficacy of this procedure and establish guidelines for an appropriate choice of patients, the experience with 43 thoracotomies in 24 children was reviewed. The appearance of first metastasis later than one year after diagnosis, presence of fewer than five nodules, and completeness of surgical resection were favorable predictors of postthoractomy survival. Early or multiple metastases, unresectable disease, and hilar, nodal, or pleural lesions conferred an unfavorable prognosis. With careful patient selection, pulmonary metastecotomy is a safe procedure that has few operative or long-term complications. It must be emphasized that although surgical removal of pulmonary metastases prolongs survival with good quality of life, the majority of patients with bone sarcomas ultimately succumb to their disease after thoracotomy. Follow-up time of greater than eight years is necessary to adequately assess the effectiveness of pulmonary resection in eradicating all disease in these patients.",237,1
"Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size. Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized. Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired. When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output. Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness. Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors. Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate. Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration. The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation.",315,0
"Dexamethasone-nonsuppressible cortisol in two cases with aldosterone-producing adenoma. Forty-one patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) were subjected to a dexamethasone suppression test (DST) before surgery. Serum cortisol and urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids were suppressed by dexamethasone in 39 patients [DST(+)]. In two patients (cases A and B), they were not suppressed [DST(-)]. Clinical manifestations of the two DST(-) patients were similar to those of DST(+) patients. Hypertension, hypokalemia, high serum aldosterone levels, and suppressed PRA were found in all of the patients. The cut surfaces of the adenomas from all of the patients, including cases A and B, were golden yellow, which is typical of APA. However, atrophies of the adjacent normal tissues were evident exclusively in the two DST(-) patients. After removal of the affected adrenals, the serum cortisol level was suppressed by dexamethasone in one of the DST(-) patients (case B). These findings suggested autonomous cortisol production by APA. To evaluate whether cortisol could be produced from the adenoma tissue, the presence of several steroidogenic enzymes was studied by immunohistochemistry and mRNA analysis in the adenomas and the adjacent nonneoplastic adrenals from the 2 DST(-) and 5 DST(+) patients. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that steroidogenic enzymes were expressed in APA tumor tissues from both DST(-) and DST(+) patients. In both groups, mRNAs coding steroidogenic enzymes were present not only in the nonneoplastic but also in the tumor tissues. Quantitative analysis of the mRNA levels revealed that in the adrenals from DST(+) patients, the mRNAs were more abundant in nonneoplastic tissue than in tumor tissue. However, in those from DST(-) cases, the mRNAs were much more abundant in the tumor tissues than in the nonneoplastic tissues. These results indicate that tumor cells of the two DST(-) patients autonomously synthesized not only aldosterone but also cortisol. The diameters of the tumors from the two DST(-) patients exceeded 3 cm, while those from other DST(+) patients were smaller. In patients with large APA, adrenal insufficiency should be anticipated upon removal of the tumor.",449,1
"Coronary pathology predicts conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting. Conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting may result from compromised septal blood flow. To examine this hypothesis we reviewed the preoperative coronary angiography of 55 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Thirty-five patients had either no lesion or a discrete lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery that did not include the septal perforator (type I anatomy). Twenty patients had a lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery at the origin of the first septal branch, a lesion of the first septal artery, or a pair of lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery that straddled the origin of the first septal artery; all lesions were proximal to the graft site (type II anatomy). None of the patients with type I anatomy had a major conduction disturbance after coronary artery bypass grafting. Eleven of the patients with type II anatomy had major conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting; right bundle-branch block in 1, right bundle-branch block and left anterior hemiblock in 2, left bundle-branch block in 5, and complete atrioventricular block that required pacemaker implantation in 3 (p less than 0.001). In the 20 patients with type II anatomy, the appearance of conduction disturbances correlated well with the absence of retrograde flow to the septal branches from the right coronary artery (p less than 0.01). Pathological lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery that compromise flow in the first perforator and that do not provide an adequate circulation produce localized damage and conduction disturbances after coronary artery bypass grafting. This can be predicted from the preoperative angiographic anatomy.",341,0
"Molteno implants and operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxicity. A clinicopathologic report. The right eye of a 75-year-old man with a history of cataract extraction, three penetrating keratoplasties, laser trabeculoplasty, two Molteno implants, and an operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxic lesion was studied post mortem. Histopathologic examination of the anterior segment showed evidence of penetrating keratoplasty, cataract surgery, and two Molteno implants with minimal associated tissue response. Ultrastructural examination showed a loose collagenous matrix surrounding the Molteno reservoirs, suggesting aqueous percolation from the reservoirs into the conjunctiva. Posteriorly, in the area of the phototoxic operating microscope-induced lesion, a nodule of retinal pigment epithelial hyperplasia with overlying atrophy of the photoreceptor cell layer of the neurosensory retina was noted. The retina also contained cystoid macular edema and an extensive preretinal membrane that was clinically unexpected.",193,1
"Presence of identical mitochondrial proteins in unstimulated constitutive steroid-producing R2C rat Leydig tumor and stimulated nonconstitutive steroid-producing MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells. The acute regulation of steroidogenesis in steroidogenic tissues requires de novo protein synthesis. It is believed that these newly synthesized proteins are instrumental in the delivery of the substrate, cholesterol, to the inner mitochondrial membrane where the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. A number of studies have attempted to characterize the protein(s) synthesized in response to hormone stimulation and, hence, function in the delivery of cholesterol to the cholesterol side-chain cleavage complex. While a number of potential protein candidates have been described, there is at present no unequivocal evidence which indicates that they are involved in steroidogenic regulation. We and others have described proteins that are induced in a variety of steroidogenic tissues in response to hormone stimulation and are localized in the mitochondria of these tissues. In an attempt to determine whether these induced proteins may be involved in steroidogenesis, we compared mitochondrial protein profiles in two separate Leydig tumor cell line. One cell line, the MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell line, has a very low basal steroid production, but synthesizes large amounts of progesterone in response to both tropic hormone and cAMP analog. The other cell line, the R2C rat Leydig tumor cell line, produces constitutively large amounts of progesterone, which cannot be increased further with hormone stimulation. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins demonstrated that four 30-kDa proteins are induced in response to hormonal stimulation in MA-10 cells. Further, it was shown that proteins identical to these induced proteins are present constitutively in the mitochondria of R2C cells and cannot be further increased with hormone stimulation. These results strongly suggest that the 30-kDa mitochondrial proteins shown to be induced in several steroidogenic tissues are involved in the acute regulation of steroid production.",397,1

"Human hepatic regenerative stimulator substance: partial purification and biological characterization of hepatic stimulator substance from human fetal liver cells. Current support or replacement therapies for fulminant acute hepatic failure are frequently very disappointing. In this study, human hepatic stimulator substance--a liver-specific growth factor--was partially purified from human fetal liver cells and characterized by its biological effects. Almost 70-fold protein content was purified with an approximately 80-fold increase in specific growth stimulator activity. Human hepatic stimulator substance proved to be heat-stable, protease-sensitive, organ-specific and species-nonspecific. Human hepatic stimulator substance produced a two- to threefold increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA when injected intraperitoneally into growing weanling mice (nonhepatectomized) or regenerating rats (34% hepatectomy). The effects of hHSS in reversing the lethality of D-galactosamine (1.6 gm/kg body weight)-induced hepatic necrosis in rats were further evaluated. A survival rate of 4% (n = 24), 41% (n = 12, p less than 0.05), 33% (n = 12, p less than 0.05), 31% (n = 13, p less than 0.05) and 18% (n = 11, p greater than 0.05) was observed when the rats were injected with 4 ml of saline intraperitoneally, 4 ml of human intact fetal hepatocytes (2.4 x 10(8] intraperitoneally, 4 ml of human hepatic stimulator substance intraperitoneally, 2 ml of twofold concentrated human hepatic stimulator substance intravenously and 1 ml of fourfold human hepatic stimulator substance intramuscularly, respectively, 20 hr after poisoning.",404,0
"Intra-abdominal ""angiosarcomatosis"" report of two cases after pelvic irradiation. Angiosarcomas account for only 1% to 2% of all soft tissue sarcomas with the most common site of origin being skin and subcutaneous tissue particularly on the face and scalp of elderly patients. These neoplasms rarely arise in the small or large bowel with presentation as diffuse abdominal ""angiosarcomatosis."" Two patients are reported who were treated with adjuvant pelvic irradiation for gynecologic malignancies (squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium) in whom diffuse abdominal angiosarcoma of intestinal origin developed 7 and 18 years later. Both patients were treated with standard megavoltage irradiation. The clinical course was rapid in both cases with death due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage and bowel obstruction. The pertinent literature relating to the association between radiation therapy and subsequent development of angiosarcomas of soft tissues and other sites is briefly reviewed.",199,1
"Electrocardiographic signs of atrial overload in hypertensive patients: indexes of abnormality of atrial morphology or function? Left atrial electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities have been reported as common findings in hypertension; however, their relationships with atrial anatomy are still uncertain. In addition, in arterial hypertension several studies demonstrated an abnormal left ventricular filling. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships of the ECG signs of left atrial abnormality to atrial anatomy and left ventricular filling as evaluated by pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler in a group of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. To this end, 53 untreated essential hypertensive patients (age 44 +/- 8 years; blood pressure 160.5 +/- 21.5/104.7 +/- 13.5 mm Hg) underwent a complete 12-lead ECG and a PW Doppler study of the transmitral flow velocities. The ECG criteria of left atrial abnormality were: P wave wider than 0.12 (or 0.10) second or higher than 0.25 mV in lead II; P wave/PR segment ratio (Macruz index) greater than 1.6 in lead II; and P wave terminal forces in lead V1 equal to or more negative than 0.04. Echocardiographic measurements were made according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) convention. Doppler parameters of left ventricular filling were measured as E and A peak velocity, A/E ratio, and the ratio between the velocity-time integral under the E peak and that of the whole diastolic flow, which represents the rapid filling fraction (RFF). At least one ECG sign of atrial abnormality was present in 34 patients (64%); the Macruz index gave the most common ECG index of atrial abnormality (31 patients).",371,0
"Mycosis fungoides-like lesions associated with phenytoin and carbamazepine therapy. We report the cases of four patients who were taking the anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin or carbamazepine and in whom skin lesions developed that showed histologic features suggestive of mycosis fungoides. Two patients had a solitary lesion on the trunk, whereas the other two patients had multiple plaques. In all four patients systemic signs were absent. ",89,1
"The Merkel cell and associated neoplasms in the eyelids and periocular region. Merkel cells are clear oval cells in the epidermis and outer root sheaths of hair follicles, which are probably of epithelial origin, share ultrastructural features with neuroendocrine cells, and are found in association with touch receptors. In the eyelid, they occur singly in the epidermis and external root sheaths of hairs and eyelashes, and in specialized touch spots alternating with eyelashes. Their typical electron microscopical and antigenic features include dense-core granules, intranuclear rodlets, spinous processes, and a positive reaction for specific cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and synaptophysin. Merkel cell carcinoma probably develops from precursor cells which give rise to keratinocytes and Merkel cells, and nearly one out of ten Merkel cell carcinomas occur in the eyelid and periocular region. They tend to be bulging lesions near the lid margin of elderly patients, reddish in color, and erythematous with telangiectatic vessels. The diagnosis is based on the frequent presence of neurofilaments and paranuclear aggregates of intermediate filaments in addition to features typical of normal Merkel cells. The tumor often mimics lymphoma or undifferentiated carcinoma and frequently invades lymphatic vessels. One third of Merkel cell carcinomas recur, almost two thirds give rise to regional node metastases, and up to one half metastasize widely and result in death. Initial treatment should be prompt and aggressive, with wide resection and routine postoperative irradiation. Although metastatic lesions often respond to radiation therapy and cytostatic drugs, these treatments are mainly of palliative value. ",329,1
"Clinical controversies surrounding thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The treatment of acute myocardial infarction has changed tremendously in the past decade because thrombolytic therapy has become the treatment of choice for the patient with acute myocardial infarction. Although many issues have been resolved, several controversial issues remain unresolved.

"Adverse mortality experience of a southwestern American Indian community: overall death rates and underlying causes of death in Pima Indians. As part of an ongoing epidemiologic study, the death rate and causes of death during 1975 through 1984 were determined in Pima Indians who resided in the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) in 1965 and later. Death certificates were available for 677 of the 681 deaths. In 78% of the deaths, the underlying cause recorded on the death certificate agreed with the cause determined after review of all available relevant records. The age- and sex-adjusted average annual death rate for the GRIC population (1639/100,000) was 1.9 times (95% CI 1.7-2.0) the 1980 rate for the U.S. all races (878/100,000). In Pima males, whose death rate was substantially higher than that of Pima females, the age-adjusted death rate was 2.3 times that in U.S. males, all races. Moreover among males 25-34 years of age, the Pima death rate was 6.6 times that for the U.S. all races. Diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms caused 59% of U.S. deaths in 1980, but only 19% of GRIC deaths. By contrast, the age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate in the GRIC Pima was 5.9 times the rate of the U.S. all races for accidents, 6.5 times for cirrhosis, 7.4 times for homicide, 4.3 times for suicide, and 11.9 times for diabetes. Tuberculosis and coccidioidomycosis were important causes of death in the Pima, for whom infectious diseases was the tenth leading cause of death. The findings indicate that programs to improve the adverse mortality experience of the GRIC population should emphasize factors related to fatal accidents, alcoholic cirrhosis, homicide, suicide, diabetes mellitus, and infectious diseases. Young Pimas, especially the males, should be the primary focus of such preventive efforts. These findings and recommendations probably apply to many Native American populations.",484,1

"Risk for colon adenomas in patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hyperplastic polyps found in the rectosigmoid area of the colon are associated with proximal adenomas, and to judge whether patients with distal hyperplastic polyps found during sigmoidoscopy might benefit from full colonoscopy. DESIGN: Data on patients having colonoscopy collected prospectively according to a set protocol. The size and location of all polyps were noted, and all polyps were biopsied. SETTING: Two university hospitals. PATIENTS: One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy between 31 December 1987 and 31 August 1989. RESULTS: Of the 970 patients who met eligibility requirements, 274 (28.3%) had adenomas and 108 (11.1%) had hyperplastic polyps. The proportion of patients with distal hyperplastic polyps and proximal adenomas (31.9%) was similar to the proportion of those without distal hyperplastic polyps (23.0%) (crude odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.77 to 3.06). After adjusting for age and sex, the results were unchanged (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53; CI, 0.82 to 2.88). Patients with distal adenomas, on the other hand, were three times more likely to have proximal adenomas than those without distal adenomas (adjusted odds ratio, 3.42; CI, 1.99 to 5.88). CONCLUSIONS: Distal hyperplastic polyps are not strong predictors of risk for proximal adenomas. Based on the magnitude of the risk difference, we do not believe that finding a hyperplastic polyp during sigmoidoscopy justifies doing a full colonoscopy to search for proximal adenomas. Because rectosigmoid adenomas are associated with proximal adenomas, however, small polyps seen during sigmoidoscopy should be biopsied to determine their type. Colonoscopy should be reserved for patients who are proved to have adenomas.",440,0
"Increased MEPP frequency as an early sign of experimental immune-mediated motoneuron disease. Intracellular recordings of miniature end-plate potentials were performed in extensor digitorum longus muscles from guinea pigs with experimental immune-mediated motoneuron destruction. In the early stages of the disease, the miniature end-plate potential frequency was elevated compared to that in control and normal animals. The amplitude and time course of the miniature end-plate potentials as well as the resting potential of the muscle fibers were not altered, which implies integrity of the postjunctional membrane. The increase in frequency of miniature end-plate potential reflects an increase of basal acetylcholine release and documents dysfunction of the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction. The increased frequency was associated with high levels of antimotoneuronal IgG in the blood and the presence of IgG at motor end-plates. These data suggest that the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction may be involved in the immune attack in animal models of motoneuron degeneration. ",203,0
"Body position changes redistribute lung computed-tomographic density in patients with acute respiratory failure. Ten patients with parenchymal acute respiratory failure (ARF) underwent computed tomography (CT) scans while in the supine and prone positions. At equal levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, the authors measured the changes of CT density in dorsal and ventral basilar lung regions induced by the change of position as well as alterations of gas exchange. The level of venous admixture did not change with body position. The CT scan image of each lung was fractionated into ten levels from dorsal to ventral, each constituting 10% of the lung height. After measuring each lung fraction, the volume, the average CT number, its frequency distribution, and the expected normal value, we computed the lung tissue mass, the excess tissue mass, and the fraction of normally inflated tissue (excess tissue mass = amount of ""tissue,"" which includes edema, cells, and blood in excess of the expected normal value). We also estimated the superimposed hydrostatic pressure on each lung region. We found that the excess lung tissue mass is independent of position. However, in patients in the supine position, lung CT density increased and regional inflation decreased from ventral to dorsal, suggesting progressive deflation of gas-containing alveoli along the gravity gradient. A similar ventral-dorsal deflation pattern occurred within 10 min in patients in the prone position. We conclude that the lung in patients with ARF behaves like an elastic body with a diffusely increased mass; dependent lung regions are compressed by the pressure of overlying structures.",315,0
"Time to recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis after curative resection of adrenal tumors in patients with Cushing's syndrome. The recovery time of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after curative resection of adrenal tumors in patients with Cushing's syndrome is poorly documented. Eight consecutive patients were treated with a standardized hydrocortisone replacement strategy after curative resection of a cortisol-secreting tumor and the time to recovery of the HPA axis was determined. Hypercortisolism was documented by elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Cure was documented by undetectable postoperative morning serum cortisol levels. Each patient received replacement hydrocortisone after surgery and was reevaluated every 3 to 6 months with an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Each patient was also monitored carefully for symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency, which was defined as symptoms consistent with this diagnosis that responded to increases in hydrocortisone levels. After surgical resection, each patient was cured of hypercortisolism. Subsequently, despite replacement hydrocortisone, each patient had symptoms of hypocortisolism, and in four of eight patients the dose of hydrocortisone was increased to relieve the symptoms. Patients required a median time of 15 months (range, 9 to 22 months) to recover a normal ACTH stimulation test and 19 months (range, 12 to 24 months) to allow discontinuation of replacement doses of hydrocortisone. The results suggest that surgical resection of a cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor will result in rapid cure of hypercortisolism, but complete recovery of the HPA axis and discontinuation of replacement steroids will require between 1 and 2 years. Normal adrenal function, as assessed by the cortisol response to ACTH, returns despite replacement doses of hydrocortisone, and replacement doses of hydrocortisone can be tapered rapidly or discontinued after a normal ACTH stimulation test.",400,1
"Bactericidal effect of doxycycline associated with lysosomotropic agents on Coxiella burnetii in P388D1 cells. There is no consistently reliable treatment for endocarditis resulting from chronic Coxiella burnetii infection, the causative agent of Q fever. Although certain antibiotics are recommended on the basis of their in vitro bactericidal activities, results of therapy with these antibiotics are often disappointing. To evaluate whether the currently recommended antibiotic susceptibility tests for C. burnetii give misleading results because of continued division of uninfected cells, thereby resulting in the dilution of infected cells and, hence, a false picture of antibiotic efficacy, we blocked cell division during antibiotic susceptibility testing with cycloheximide. Using this new method, we found that the currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of Q fever, doxycycline, pefloxacin, and rifampin, did not reduce the ratio of infected to noninfected cells (either L929 or P388D1) by 9 days postinfection. To test the hypothesis that this lack of antibacterial activity is due to antibiotic inactivation by the low pH of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is found, we used alkalinizing lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine or amantadine) concurrently with doxycycline. This resulted in the sterilization of C. burnetii infection in P388D1 cells. This finding seems to confirm our suspicion that the acidic conditions of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is located inhibit antibiotic activity. This inhibition can be reversed in vitro when lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents are used.",333,1
"Genetics and biology of human ovarian teratomas. II. Molecular analysis of origin of nondisjunction and gene-centromere mapping of chromosome I markers. Chromosomal heteromorphisms and DNA polymorphisms have been utilized to identify the mechanisms that lead to formation of human ovarian teratomas and to construct a gene-centromere map of chromosome 1 by using those teratomas that arise by meiotic nondisjunction. Of 61 genetically informative ovarian teratomas, 21.3% arose by nondisjunction at meiosis I, and 39.3% arose by meiosis II nondisjunction. Eight polymorphic marker loci on chromosome 1p and one marker on 1q were used to estimate a gene-centromere map. The results show clear linkage of the most proximal 1p marker (NRAS) and the most proximal 1q marker (D1S61) to the centromere at a distance of 14 cM and 20 cM, respectively. Estimated gene-centromere distances suggest that, while recombination occurs normally in ovarian teratomas arising by meiosis II errors, ovarian teratomas arising by meiosis I nondisjunction have altered patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the estimated map demonstrates clear evidence of chiasma interference. Our results suggest that ovarian teratomas can provide a rapid method for mapping genes relative to the centromere.",287,1
"The detubularized right colonic segment as urinary reservoir: evolution of technique for continent diversion. Continent diversion of urine via a cecal-right colonic reservoir has been performed at our university hospital since 1977. Several modifications of surgical technique have been devised to prevent problems of urinary leakage and difficulties in catheterization. The current technique, used during the last 3 years on 14 patients, involves use of a detubularized right colonic segment as a reservoir, ileal mesenteric exclusion, fashioning the intussuscepted ileal nipple valve with staples and anchoring of a fascia strip sling around the nipple base to the anterior rectus sheath. Complication from the reservoir outlet occurred in only 1 patient.",151,0
"Hyperthecosis of the ovaries in a woman with a placental site trophoblastic tumor. Rapidly increasing testosterone levels were observed in a patient presenting with sudden onset of virilization. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a placental site trophoblastic tumor in the uterus. Wedge biopsies of the ovaries showed extensive luteinization of the ovarian stroma in both ovaries. Concentrations of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione were markedly increased in the ovarian vein serum, indicating ovaries as the source of these steroids. The serum concentration of hCG was 69 mIU/mL. Pulsatile secretion of LH persisted in spite of elevated hCG levels. Follicle-stimulating hormone levels were low or undetectable. Elevated hCG levels and low FSH levels resulted in a hormonal environment similar to that seen in polycystic ovary disease (high LH to FSH ratio), resulting in extensive stromal luteinization. Decline in hCG levels after removal of the tumor resulted in the return of androgen levels to normal.",206,0
"Microvascular sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in human falciparum malaria: a pathological study. Thirty-nine falciparum malaria autopsy cases from the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand were divided into two groups that had had either cerebral malaria (CM) or non-cerebral malaria (NCM). We then studied significant pathological differences between these groups in order to investigate the correlation between parasitized erythrocyte (PRBC) sequestration in small blood vessels in the brain, heart, lungs and small intestines. We found that the percentage of PRBC sequestration in the organs which we studied was higher in the CM patients than in the NCM patients. The difference of PRBC sequestration among the organs of two groups was significant (P less than 0.05). In the CM group, the average percentage of PRBC sequestration in the brain was significantly higher than in the heart, lungs and small intestines (P less than 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between PRBC sequestration in the brains, hearts, lungs and small intestines in the NCM group (P greater than 0.05). Our study indicates that severity of malaria in the CM patients depends on PRBC sequestration, especially in the brain. A combination of functional disturbances of the other organs, in addition to the cerebral pathology, may augment the severity of the disease.",277,0
"1990 Volvo Award in clinical sciences. Lumbar spinal pathology in cadaveric material in relation to history of back pain, occupation, and physical loading. The occurrence of symmetric disc degeneration, anular ruptures, end-plate defects, vertebral body osteophytosis, and facet joint osteoarthrosis was examined radiographically and osteologically in 86 male cadavers for whom occupational, physical loading, and back pain histories were obtained from the men's families. History of back pain and the parameters of spinal pathology were related to the highest and lowest degrees of physical loading. In multivariate analyses, history of back injury was related to the occurrence of symmetric disc degeneration, anular ruptures, and vertebral osteophytosis. Symmetric disc degeneration was associated with sedentary work, and vertebral osteophytosis was related to heavy work. History of back pain was related to occupational physical loading after control for the effects of the other covariates. The results indicate that the least pathology stemmed from moderate or mixed physical loading, but the least back pain was associated with sedentary work.",215,0
"Endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a ""saline torch"". The fiberoptic endoscope has never gained popularity among neurosurgeons although it is ideally suited for navigating within the cerebral ventricles. Recent advances in optics and miniaturization make the application of endoscopy in neurosurgery more practical. The authors report eight children who underwent ventriculoscopic fenestration of symptomatic loculated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections. These CSF collections were either isolated ventricular cysts or trapped lateral ventricles secondary to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. Cyst wall dissection was carried out with a ""saline torch"" dissector which was introduced through a working channel in the ventriculoscope. The torch was used to coagulate vessels and to sculpt large windows in cyst walls or in the septum pellucidum. Ventriculoscope-guided cyst fenestration can be performed safely and easily under direct vision. The technique may permit simplification of shunt systems in some patients and elimination of shunts in others. ",202,1
"Geographic variation of inflammatory bowel disease within the United States. One approach to learn about possible environmental risks in inflammatory bowel disease relates to studying its geographic pattern of occurrence. The geographic variation of inflammatory bowel disease within the United States was analyzed using the accumulated 17.5 million hospital discharges of all U.S. Medicare beneficiaries during two consecutive years. To validate the geographic pattern shown by the Medicare data, hospitalization was compared with mortality from inflammatory bowel disease among different states. Mortality and hospitalization statistics both suggested that the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease was determined by environmental factors that had a marked geographic variation within the United States. Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis appeared to be more frequent in northern parts of the United States than in southern and in urban more than rural parts. These trends were observed for men and women and for blacks and whites alike. Similar geographic patterns of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis suggested the influence of one or more identical risk factors for both diseases.",196,0
"Diarrhea in ciguatera fish poisoning: preliminary evaluation of pathophysiological mechanisms. Ciguatera fish poisoning is a clinical syndrome consisting of a combination of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms occurring after eating toxin-containing tropical reef fish; it is a major cause of morbidity in Hawaii, the South Pacific, Australia, and the Caribbean. In an effort to define pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the diarrheal component of the illness, we examined the effect of crude and fractionated toxin preparations on isolated rabbit ileal tissue in a Ussing chamber model. Both the crude toxin preparation (prepared from toxic Ctenochaetus strigosus) and 10% and 50% methanol-chloroform toxin fraction (prepared from a pool of toxic fish samples) gave a striking increase in transepithelial electrical potential difference and short-circuit current. Enterotoxic activity seemed to be mediated by calcium. When examined by light microscopy, the intestinal mucosa was not damaged by the toxin preparations used. Our data demonstrate that toxins involved in ciguatera fish poisoning directly stimulate intestinal fluid secretion without accompanying tissue damage and suggest that calcium is the ""second messenger"" mediating the process.",233,0

"Gamma-detecting probe and autoradiographic studies of radiolabeled antibody B72.3 in CX-1 colon xenografts. Nude mice bearing CX-1 colon tumors were injected with 50 microCi 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) B72.3. Radioactivity in tumors was studied with the gamma detecting probe (GDP) on days 1, 3, 7, and 10 after MAb injection. On each day, two mice were sacrificed and sections were examined with autoradiography (ARG), immunoperoxidase methods (IMP), and routine stains. Mean probe counts showed increasing tumor to background ratios and ARG demonstrated a progressive increase in radionuclide in the tumors. The distribution of 125I was primarily around the vascular spaces on day 1, but by day 3 and progressively it appeared in tumor gland lumina and necrotic areas. A regional correlation was shown between radionuclide in vascular spaces and its sequestration in tumor elements.",203,1
"Posterior nuchal cystic hygroma [published erratum appears in Clin Perinatol 1990 Dec;17(4):viii] When cystic hygroma is detected antenatally, the prognosis is usually poor, and intrauterine or neonatal death are common. This seems especially true for Turner syndrome (the largest etiologic group associated with cystic hygroma) and the lethal multiple pterygium syndromes. However, some fetuses with Turner syndrome, and also with certain other diagnoses, had a good outcome, and further study of these conditions is required before more definite prognostic indicators and risk figures will be available. Increasing numbers of syndromes are being reported in association with fetal cystic hygroma, and lymphedema may be a common element in their pathogenesis. Mild, short-lived, or otherwise uncomplicated jugular lymphatic obstruction may be a cause of the neck webbing seen in the Noonan, familial pterygium colli, and distichiasis-lymphedema syndromes. With earlier and more widespread fetal ultrasonography, and more sensitive techniques, a greater number of resolving fetal cases may be reported. This may clarify the natural history and provide prospective criteria for the conditions that have better prognoses. The associated conditions include autosomal dominant and recessive genetic traits. Careful ultrasound study for other malformations, polyhydramnios and fetal growth parameters, a fetal karyotype, and, if appropriate, pathologic examination are required to determine the etiology and recurrence risk. The parents should be asked about exposure to alcohol or other agents and should be examined for signs of pterygium colli or Noonan syndrome. If the decision is made to continue the pregnancy, and there is doubt about the natural history and prognosis, multi-disciplinary supervision should include social services, neonatology, pediatric surgery, cardiology, and genetics specialties when indicated.",370,1
"Orthostatic hypotension in human immunodeficiency virus infection may be the result of generalized autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We used an autonomic nervous system (ANS) testing battery to determine if generalized ANS dysfunction was present in five human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients presenting with severe orthostatic hypotension (OH). All five patients had abnormal ANS testing, which demonstrated both sympathetic and parasympathetic defects, i.e., generalized ANS dysfunction. Treatment with fludrocortisone effectively reversed the OH in four of the five patients. The OH was transient in these four patients. We believe it is important to recognize that OH may be the result of generalized ANS dysfunction in HIV-positive patients and that it can be effectively treated. ",145,0
"Decalcification of a choroidal osteoma. A 56-year-old man presented with a clearly defined orange tumour in the posterior pole of his left eye. A choroidal osteoma was suspected, and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the nasal edge of the tumour, which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice. Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment. Three years after the patient first presented, thinning of the tumour was noted on follow-up examination. During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared, leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy. Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography.",160,1
"Role of mastectomy in breast cancer. The surgical management of breast cancer continues to evolve in an attempt to define the ideal line between therapeutic efficacy and morbidity. It is clear that breast cancer is a biologically heterogeneous group of diseases, and no single hypothesis explains its behavior. The surgical options proposed to the individual patient must draw from the experience of retrospective clinical studies and prospective randomized trials in an attempt to optimize the treatment plan. Most patients without distant disease are eligible to consider mastectomy, which can accomplish excellent local control and significantly improve survival for earlier stages of disease. However, breast conservation remains an appropriate alternative for a carefully defined subset of patients. Today, with early-stage disease, no patient need leave the operating room without a breast. Recent advances in reconstructive surgery make mastectomy with immediate reconstruction or limited resection plus axillary dissection with postoperative radiation therapy the two principal treatment choices available. Future studies will focus on the integration of other treatment modalities. Clinical research into the use of preoperative chemotherapy to downstage the disease to permit less extensive surgery is of interest. Recent application of molecular biologic techniques such as oncogene analysis, cytogenetic studies, proliferative indices, and the highly sensitive detection of distant micrometastases using monoclonal antibodies may assist in the design of innovative approaches to surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic drug treatment. These advances show great promise for improving the quality of life and the cure rate for patients with breast cancer. Today, surgical treatment options have evolved that fulfill some of the objectives outlined by Dr. James Ewing of Memorial Hospital some 50 years ago. His concerns about breast cancer remain as relevant today as they were half a century ago: ""I have drawn the impression that in dealing with mammary cancer, surgery meets with more peculiar difficulties and uncertainties than with almost any other form of the disease. The anatomical types are so numerous, the variations in clinical course so wide, the paths of dissemination so free and diverse, the difficulties of determining the actual conditions so complex, and the sacrifice of tissues so great, as to render impossible in the majority of cases a reasonably accurate adjustment of a means to an end."".",426,1
"The effect of pH buffering on reducing the pain associated with subcutaneous infiltration of bupivicaine [published erratum appears in Am J Emerg Med 1991 Jul;9(4):410] The authors propose that pH buffering of bupivicaine with sodium bicarbonate reduces the pain associated with its local subcutaneous infiltration. In a double-blind, prospective study, 62 healthy adult volunteers received a 0.5 mL subcutaneous infiltration of 0.5% buffered bupivicaine into the dorsum of a randomly chosen hand. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 by adding 0.05 mL of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/L [corrected]) to 10 mL vials of commercially available bupivicaine (1:200 dilution). The control hand was injected with the same amount of unbuffered agent. Pain was scored after each infiltration using a nonsegmented visual analogue scale. Student's t-test for paired measurements was used to analyze intergroup pain score differences. Forty-three subjects (69%) reported less pain with buffered bupivicaine and only 17 (27%) noted a modest increase: two subjects (3%) reported no difference. The mean pain score for the buffered agent was 22 mm compared with 30 mm for the control. The mean difference (control-experimental) was 8 mm (t = 4.64, df = 61, P less than .001). The authors conclude that the addition of sodium bicarbonate to bupivicaine reduces the pain associated with its local infiltration.",338,0
"Long-term potentiation of electrotonic coupling at mixed synapses. Long-term potentiation of chemical synapses is closely related to memory and learning. Studies of this process have concentrated on chemically mediated excitatory synapses. By contrast, activity-dependent modification of gap junctions, which also widely exist in higher structures such as hippocampus and neocortex, has not been described. Here we report that at mixed synapses between sensory afferents and an identified reticulospinal neuron, the electrotonic coupling potential can be potentiated, as well as the chemically mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential, for a prolonged time period using a stimulation paradigm like that which produces long-term potentiation in hippocampus. The effect on coupling is due to an increase in gap-junctional conductance. Our data indicate that the potentiation of both synaptic components requires an increase in intracellular calcium, involves activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and is specific to the tetanized pathway.

"Feasibility of reversing benzodiazepine tolerance with flumazenil To examine whether the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse tolerance to benzodiazepines but without precipitating withdrawal seizures, the antiepileptic effect of flumazenil itself and its ability to reverse tolerance at a dose that would leave sufficient receptors free for the binding of benzodiazepines were investigated. Electroencephalographic studies in 6 patients with partial and 6 with generalised seizures showed that flumazenil had a short (20 min) non-dose-dependent suppressant effect on epileptic discharges in those with partial seizures. Receptor occupancy studies in 12 patients showed that 1.5 mg flumazenil given intravenously occupied 55% receptors, whereas 15 mg occupied nearly all receptors. When 3 patients with partial seizures who had become tolerant to clonazepam were given 1.5 mg flumazenil, they were seizure-free for 6-21 days after the injection. The value of intermittent therapy with a benzodiazepine antagonist for preventing or reversing tolerance to benzodiazepine agonists ought to be investigated further.",235,0
"Cathepsins D and E in normal, metaplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous gastric tissue: an immunohistochemical study. Immunohistochemical distributions of cathepsins D and E were determined in normal mucosa, metaplastic, dysplastic, and cancerous lesions of the human stomach. Cathepsins D and E were localised in the foveolar epithelium and parietal cells of the normal gastric mucosa, but their intracytoplasmic distributions were different - cathepsin E distribution was even and diffuse in the cytoplasm while cathepsin D was found in coarse intracytoplasmic granules. Chronic inflammation and ulcer did not influence the distribution of these enzymes. No positive staining was obtained in the incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumour cells of signet ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, however, gave strong and diffuse stainings for cathepsins D and E in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that the distribution of cathepsins D and E is related to each specialised function of the foveolar epithelium and the parietal cells, and that their disappearance is associated with development of well differentiated adenocarcinoma from intestinal metaplasia.

"Potential value of hormone receptor assay in carcinoma in situ of breast. The estrogen receptor (ER) expression of invasive breast cancer has been extensively studied both biochemically and with specific monoclonal antibodies against ER. Relatively few studies have attempted to characterize ER pattern in breast carcinoma in situ (CIS) and in other premalignant lesions. In the current study, the authors investigated the pattern of ER expression in 62 cases of breast CIS, 30 of which had a component of invasive cancer, and 36 cases of atypical hyperplasia. Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed breast tissue underwent enzyme pretreatment to expose nuclear antigenic sites as previously described. Breast tissues then underwent estrogen immunocytochemical assay using specific monoclonal antibodies (Abbott Laboratory, Chicago, IL). The cases were evaluated for heterogeneity, intensity of staining, and percentage of ER-positive cells. An attempt was made to study the relation between the pattern of ER expression, nuclear pleomorphism, and type of CIS. The results of ER immunocytochemical assay showed positive nuclear staining for ER in 75% of the CIS, 73% of CIS with invasive cancer, and 100% of atypical hyperplasias. ER expression in CIS agreed with that in the invasive carcinoma in 29 of 30 cases. This study also suggests that comedocarcinoma has a higher incidence of negative ER expression than the other types of CIS, particularly when it is associated with significant nuclear pleomorphism. There was no significant difference in ER tumor heterogeneity between premalignant and malignant lesions.",313,1
"Squamous carcinoma of the posterior pharyngeal wall. We have reviewed a 12-year experience with 295 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the pharynx in order to focus on 78 patients whose lesions arose in the posterior wall. Surgery was the definitive therapy for the primary tumor in 57 (73%), including 3 treatment groups. Thirty-two patients had limited resections that preserved the larynx, involving local excision (7 patients), anterior pharyngotomy (7 patients), lateral pharyngotomy (6 patients), median labiomandibular glossotomy (6 patients), or median mandibulotomy with paralingual extension (6 patients). The second group consisted of 21 patients with more extensive tumors who required a laryngectomy and complex reconstruction, often with postoperative radiotherapy. Finally, there were four patients who developed metachronous second primaries in the pharynx subsequent to a laryngectomy. All required flap reconstruction. Of the 21 patients whose primary treatment was radiotherapy, 5 had lesions that were implanted after access was provided by a mandibulotomy. Cumulative 5-year survival was 32% and ranged from 44% in those with favorable lesions to 15% in those with extensive tumors. Our experience highlights the variety of treatment approaches available in patients with pharyngeal carcinomas confined to the posterior wall. Surgery in this setting carries acceptable morbidity and yields survival rates that compare favorably with those achieved by external radiation therapy alone. Results in patients with extensive lesions still leave much to be desired, despite radical surgery and aggressive radiotherapy. Innovative brachytherapy techniques using surgery for access deserve further investigation.",333,1
"Renal vein leiomyosarcoma. The 11th case of primary leiomyosarcoma of the renal vein is reported. Unique features of this case included concomitant resection of an isolated hepatic metastasis, intraoperative radiation therapy, and the use of electron microscopy and immunohistochemical stains in confirming the diagnosis. A review of the previously reported cases shows a tendency toward slow tumor growth and infrequent recurrence (18%). Metastases are common (82%), primarily to the lung and liver. Aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant radiation therapy, including intraoperative radiation therapy, are recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered, although its benefits at present are unclear.",132,1
"Electrocardiographic signs of atrial overload in hypertensive patients: indexes of abnormality of atrial morphology or function? Left atrial electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities have been reported as common findings in hypertension; however, their relationships with atrial anatomy are still uncertain. In addition, in arterial hypertension several studies demonstrated an abnormal left ventricular filling. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships of the ECG signs of left atrial abnormality to atrial anatomy and left ventricular filling as evaluated by pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler in a group of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. To this end, 53 untreated essential hypertensive patients (age 44 +/- 8 years; blood pressure 160.5 +/- 21.5/104.7 +/- 13.5 mm Hg) underwent a complete 12-lead ECG and a PW Doppler study of the transmitral flow velocities. The ECG criteria of left atrial abnormality were: P wave wider than 0.12 (or 0.10) second or higher than 0.25 mV in lead II; P wave/PR segment ratio (Macruz index) greater than 1.6 in lead II; and P wave terminal forces in lead V1 equal to or more negative than 0.04. Echocardiographic measurements were made according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) convention. Doppler parameters of left ventricular filling were measured as E and A peak velocity, A/E ratio, and the ratio between the velocity-time integral under the E peak and that of the whole diastolic flow, which represents the rapid filling fraction (RFF). At least one ECG sign of atrial abnormality was present in 34 patients (64%); the Macruz index gave the most common ECG index of atrial abnormality (31 patients).",371,0
"Papillary adenocarcinoma of the middle ear. A case of papillary adenocarcinoma of the middle ear is presented. The patient had an unusually short history of otalgia, aural discharge and facial palsy, and, at presentation the tumour was too large for surgical resection to be a feasible option.

"Effects of vagal stimulation on experimentally induced seizures in rats. Repetitive stimulation of the vagus nerve inhibits chemically induced seizures in dogs. We report here the results and conclusions from studies designed to answer some of the immediate questions raised by this finding. (1) Maximal stimulation of vagal C fibers at frequencies greater than 4 Hz prevents or reduces chemically and electrically induced seizures in young male rats. (2) Antiepileptic potency is directly related to the fraction of vagal C fibers stimulated. (3) Vagal stimulation shortens but does not shut down a chemical seizure once it has begun. (4) In rats, optimal stimulus frequency is approximately 10-20 Hz; duration of stimulus, 0.5-1 ms; and stimulus strength, 0.2-0.5 mA/mm2 of nerve cross-section. These results, when taken together with similar results obtained from dogs, monkeys, and humans, strongly suggest that periodic stimulation of the vagus nerve using appropriate stimulation parameters is a powerful method for preventing seizures. The data from the literature suggest that the antiepileptic actions of vagal stimulation are largely mediated by widespread release of GABA and glycine in the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The probable pathway is via projections from the nucleus of the solitary tract to the reticular formation and thence by diffuse projections to the cortex and other areas. Intermittent vagal stimulation has the potentiality of reducing the number and/or the intensity of seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy. These results indicate that feasibility studies in humans should be continued and expanded.",320,0
"Moustache appearance in craniopharyngiomas: unique magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic findings of perifocal edema. This report describes two cases of craniopharyngioma with perifocal edema. In both patients, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the tumors occupied the suprasellar cistern, invaginated the floor of the 3rd ventricle and were tightly adherent to the ventricular walls. The intraventricular portions of the tumors were cystic, containing protein-rich fluid as suggested by MRI and confirmed by operative findings. There was perifocal edema in the hypothalamus adjacent to the intraventricular tumor, the optic tracts, and the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, resembling the shape of a moustache on axial computed tomographic and MRI scans. The perifocal edema subsided after treatment of the intraventricular tumor by surgical resection or radiation therapy. The ""moustache"" appearance seems a unique, characteristic feature of perifocal edema, which is observed infrequently with certain craniopharyngiomas.",203,1
"Node-negative breast cancer: prognostic subgroups defined by tumor size and flow cytometry Adjuvant systemic therapy for women with node-negative breast cancer is most easily justified for those patients at highest risk of relapse. We have examined the impact of tumor size, histologic grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor ploidy, and S-phase fraction (SPF) on relapse-free survival (RFS) for 169 patients with node-negative breast cancer in order to identify groups of patients at high and low risk of relapse. Patients with small tumors (less than or equal to 1.0 cm) had a significantly better RFS than those with larger tumors (P = .005), with 96% remaining relapse-free at 5 years. Patients with tumors less than or equal to 1.0 cm were thus excluded from analysis when attempting to define a group with a poor prognosis. Within the group of patients with tumors greater than 1.0 cm, tumor ploidy (P = .63), ER status (P = .3), or progesterone receptor (PgR) status (P = .24) did not predict for RFS. Patients with grade 1 or 2 infiltrating ductal tumors had a significantly better prognosis than those with grade 3 tumors (P = .04). The prognostic factor that gave the widest separation between subgroups, however, was SPF. Patients whose tumors were greater than 1.0 cm with an SPF less than or equal to 10% had a 5-year RFS of 78% compared with a 5-year RFS of 52% for those with an SPF greater than 10% (P = .006). We have combined tumor size and SPF to identify three prognostic groups: (1) tumor less than or equal to 1.0 cm, 5-year RFS 96%; (2) tumor greater than 1.0 cm plus SPF less than or equal to 10%, 5-year RFS 78%; 3) tumor greater than 1.0 cm plus SPF greater than 10%, 5-year RFS 52%. These prognostic groupings may help identify patients most suitable for adjuvant therapy.",471,1
"Transcranial Doppler determination of cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing CPR: methodology and preliminary findings. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To correlate cerebral arterial blood velocity measurements as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound with various resuscitation maneuvers performed in an uncontrolled manner in a series of cardiac arrest patients undergoing standard resuscitation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Any patient undergoing resuscitation for a nontraumatic cardiac arrest was eligible for the study. INTERVENTIONS: Resuscitation was carried out while flow velocities were monitored in various intracranial arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Vessel identification was based on the angle and depth of insonation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The internal carotid artery was located more consistently than either middle cerebral or ophthalmic arteries and provided superior waveforms for analysis. Alterations in flow velocity were noted and correlated to various therapeutic interventions. Flow velocities were 70% of normal during the early phase of resuscitation but deteriorated over time until there was no evidence of net forward flow. Even early in CPR, flow was demonstrated only during systole. CONCLUSION: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound appears to be a potentially promising means of determining cerebral flow in patients undergoing CPR.",221,0
"Umbilical cord ulceration and intestinal atresia: a new association? In three fetuses, congenital intestinal atresia was associated with linear ulcerations of the umbilical cord. In two cases, hemorrhage was seen from the cord ulcer. Both fetuses required emergency cesarean section for fetal distress and were born anemic. The third fetus was mildly hydropic, attributed to hemorrhage, and was stillborn. The mechanism of the association could not be determined. These cases suggest a risk of prenatal umbilical cord hemorrhage in infants with intestinal atresia. ",110,0
"Chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome after the treatment of head and neck cancer. A case report. A 62-year-old woman who was being treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck developed a chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome during the second cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate. Though the syndrome was suspected early, attempts at reversing the hematologic and renal abnormalities were unsuccessful. At postmortem examination, the characteristic microvascular lesions of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome were found in the kidneys.",123,0
"Perforin-mediated myocardial damage in acute myocarditis. Endomyocardial specimens were obtained from 7 patients with acute myocarditis. Immunohistochemical examination of the mononuclear infiltrate showed mainly cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Perforin (a pore-forming protein found in cytotoxic lymphocytes) was identified in this myocardial lymphocytic infiltrate and electron microscopy showed myocardial cell damage that may have been associated with these perforin containing lymphocytes. The results indicate that in acute idiopathic and viral myocarditis, myocardial damage may be due to the action of perforin-secreting lymphocytes.",115,0
"Nausea, vomiting, and retching. Although nausea, vomiting, and retching have plagued mankind since antiquity, limited attention has been given to the three symptoms as separate entities. Although knowledge of symptom occurrence is essential to practice, nurses must focus on patients' response or distress to the occurrence of symptoms. The differentiation of symptom occurrence and symptom distress of nausea, vomiting, and retching is critical to the management and self-care demands of patients and the enhancement of their quality of life. Basic research on patterns of these individual symptoms and their components promises to provide a more progressive and fruitful approach to the patient response to these symptoms. ",128,0
"Performing cytogenetic studies on ascitic, amniotic and hygroma fluid. The importance of obtaining cytogenetic studies on antenatally diagnosed structural malformations is well recognized. In two cases, three fetal compartments were sampled, each resulting in successful cytogenetic studies. Fluid was obtained under ultrasound guidance from amniotic fluid, fetal ascites and cystic hygroma fluid. Fluid from the hygroma itself may be the easiest compartment to analyze. ",91,1
"Insulinomas: localization with selective intraarterial injection of calcium. To facilitate the noninvasive preoperative localization of islet cell tumors less than 15 mm in diameter, the authors examined the use of calcium as an insulin secretagogue in an arterial stimulation venous sampling (ASVS) technique. In four patients with episodic hypoglycemia, calcium gluconate (0.01-0.025 mEq Ca2+/kg) was injected directly into branches of the celiac plexus (gastroduodenal, splenic, and hepatic arteries) and the superior mesenteric artery. In all patients, serum levels of insulin rose abruptly in blood samples taken from the right hepatic vein 30 and 60 seconds after the infusion of calcium into the artery supplying the tumor; injection into an artery not supplying the tumor did not result in a similar rise. Accurate localization of the insulinomas was verified at surgery in three patients. In the fourth patient, who did not undergo surgery, arteriographic results were positive for insulinoma at the predicted site. On the basis of these results, the authors believe noninvasive ASVS may replace invasive portal venous sampling as the most effective method for the localization of occult insulinomas.",245,1
"Final outcome of ursodeoxycholic acid treatment in 126 patients with radiolucent gallstones. One hundred and twenty-six patients with radiolucent gallstones in 'functioning' gallbladders were treated with 8-10 mg ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) kg/day and followed to a treatment conclusion. Complete or partial gallstone dissolution was achieved in 74 (59 per cent). However, only 22 achieved complete gallstone dissolution, as judged by two normal oral cholecystograms; ultrasonograms were performed in 16 of these patients, and all were normal. UDCA was stopped in 76 patients: because of cystic duct obstruction (n = 12), severe biliary pain (n = 13), non-response (n = 25) or partial stone dissolution with arrested progress (n = 26). Life-table analysis showed that complete gallstone dissolution rates at four years were 25-30 per cent (two normal oral cholecystograms) and 17-19 per cent (two normal oral cholecystograms plus one ultrasonogram). All patients with complete gallstone dissolution had shown partial stone dissolution at 6-12 months; of those with partial stone dissolution at six months, only 25 per cent went on to complete gallstone dissolution, and then always within two years. Efficacy correlated inversely with stone size but not with age, sex, obesity or on-treatment saturation indices. Acquired surface gallstone calcification developed in 13 patients (life-table analysis 22 +/- 7 per cent at four years); none of these patients achieved complete gallstone dissolution and only five achieved partial stone dissolution. Thus, despite relatively high partial gallstone dissolution rates, the ultimate efficacy of UDCA in achieving complete gallstone dissolution is low.",384,0
"The acutely affected abdomen in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. The records of 145 paraplegic or quadriplegic patients were reviewed to identify those factors useful in the correct diagnosis of the acute abdomen in this population. Twenty-one patients had 22 episodes of acute or subacute abdominal problems. Presenting complaints, physical findings, and laboratory results were useful in various ways. However appropriate radiographic studies led to the correct diagnosis in 77% of patients. Although paraplegic and quadriplegic patients are predisposed to a distinct constellation of medical problems, including urinary tract infection and calculi, they also may present with other abdominal conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized.",145,0
"Occupational exposure and head and neck carcinoma. An epidemiological case-control study was conducted to investigate occupational risk factors in cancers of the upper respiratory and digestive tract. Cases were men with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (667), hypopharynx (348), glottis (246), supraglottis (219), epilarynx (204), and 4 subsites of the oral cavity (787). Controls were healthy patients or patients with cancer of another site or another histological type (147 men). Past occupational exposures of cases and controls were compared. The analysis was performed independently for each site of cancer, controlling for age, amount and type of alcohol and tobacco consumption, and state of dentition. Results showed that cancer of the supraglottis was associated with exposure to oil and grease (odds ratio = 2.4; 95% confidence interval 1.0-5.8), and with exposure to cement (odds ratio = 4.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-16.4). Cancer of the glottis was also associated with exposure to dye (odds ratio = 6.4; 95% confidence interval = 0.7-56.6). Exposure to flour occurred more frequently among controls than among patients with pharyngeal or oral cancer. This might reflect an association between this occupational exposure and some particular types of cancer included in the control group.",308,1
"Treatment of metastatic melanoma with an autologous tumor-cell vaccine: clinical and immunologic results in 64 patients. We treated 64 patients with metastatic melanoma using a melanoma vaccine preceded by low-dose cyclophosphamide (CY), and monitored immunologic effects and antitumor activity. On day 0, the patients were given CY 300 mg/m2 intravenously. Three days later, they were injected intradermally with vaccine consisting of 10 to 25 x 10(6) autologous, enzymatically dissociated, cryopreserved, irradiated (25 Gy) tumor cells mixed with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). This treatment sequence was repeated every 28 days. Of 40 assessable patients with measurable metastases, five had responses, four complete and one partial, with a median duration of 10 months (7 to 84+ months). In six additional patients, we observed an antitumor response that seems to be peculiar to this vaccine therapy: the regression of metastatic lesions that appeared after the immunotherapy was begun. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to autologous, mechanically dissociated melanoma cells that had not been exposed to extraneous antigens, such as enzymes or fetal calf serum, increased significantly following immunotherapy (day 0 v day 49, P less than .001; day 0 v day 161, P less than .001; day 0 v day 217, P = .021). Antitumor responses to the vaccine were strongly associated with DTH, as indicated by three observations: (1) eight of 10 patients who exhibited tumor regression had positive DTH, (2) in postsurgical adjuvant patients, there was a highly significant linear relationship (P less than .001) between the intensity of DTH to autologous melanoma cells and the time to recurrence of tumor, and (3) nine patients who developed DTH to the autologous melanoma cells in their original vaccine developed new metastases that failed to elicit DTH or elicited a much smaller response. In three cases, we were able to excise regressing tumors for histologic examination; such tumors were characterized by an intense infiltration of lymphocytes. This demonstration that an immune response to melanoma-associated antigens can be elicited in cancer-bearing patients provides some basis for optimism about the prospects for developing active immunotherapy that has practical therapeutic value.",502,1
"Epidermoid cysts of the brain stem. Report of three cases. The authors report the cases of three patients with epidermoid cysts which insinuated themselves into the brain stem. In all three patients, the tumor occupied the pons, although in one it was predominantly located in the medulla. The cyst contents and nonadherent tumor capsule were removed in all three patients, but no attempt was made to remove tumor densely adherent to the brain stem. One patient's cyst was removed in one operation, but maximal resection in the other two required two operations. After surgery, sixth nerve function completely returned in one patient; another patient had a stable pontine gaze palsy but developed new facial weakness; and the third patient had stable cranial nerve deficits with a diminished hemiparesis. The last patient developed a pseudomeningocele and communicating hydrocephalus, and required a lumboperitoneal shunt. In all three patients, computerized tomography scans demonstrated hypodense tumors not enhanced by contrast material. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on two patients; in both, the tumors showed increased signal intensity relative to brain on T1-weighted images and decreased signal intensity relative to brain on T2-weighted studies. Magnetic resonance imaging, the most accurate modality for localizing these lesions and determining their extent, was also invaluable for postoperative monitoring and follow-up evaluation. Safe and adequate resection includes decompression of cyst contents and removal of nonadherent portions of the cyst capsule. Cyst wall adherent to the brain stem, however, should not be removed.",303,1
"Tamm-Horsfall autoantibodies in interstitial cystitis. Interstitial cystitis presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Although many etiologies, including autoimmunity, have been proposed its pathogenesis remains obscure. Tamm-Horsfall protein has been identified in the superficial urothelium of patients with interstitial cystitis demonstrating abnormal urothelial permeability. Eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of interstitial cystitis underwent cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. Characteristic cystoscopic findings were present, and each patient had chronic inflammation and mast cells by histopathological analysis. Preoperative anti-Tamm-Horsfall protein serum antibody (IgG) titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (range 500 to 8,000, mean 2,750). A control group of 8 patients with a negative urological history also had titers of 0 to 500 (p = 0.02). The humoral response to Tamm-Horsfall protein in these patients suggests a role for Tamm-Horsfall protein in interstitial cystitis. Measurement of serum Tamm-Horsfall protein antibody may prove to be useful as a noninvasive diagnostic test in patients with this disease.",249,0
"The internal oblique-iliac crest free flap in composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, skin, and mucosa. The reconstruction of oromandibular defects following ablative surgery is a challenging undertaking. When the defect involves skin as well as mucosa, the challenge becomes even greater. The internal oblique iliac crest osteomyocutaneous free flap is particularly useful for reconstruction of through-and-through composite defects due to the inclusion of two separate soft-tissue flaps on the same vascular pedicle. We report our experience with this flap in the reconstruction of 10 patients with such defects. The utility, and the limitations of this form of reconstruction are discussed in detail.",137,1

The records of 44 cases of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) presenting to the ear, nose and throat department in the Grampian area from 1980-1988 were examined in relation to site of occurrence, histology, age at presentation, clinical stage, treatment and survival. The median age was 67 years and there was a preponderance of high grade histology, especially in disease affecting the tonsil. Most deaths occurred in the first year; patients with high grade disease and those in stages three and four had a significantly poorer survival during the first year.

"Human papillomavirus screening for women with atypical Papanicolaou smears. A study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and colposcopy in the management of women whose Papanicolaou smears demonstrated atypia less than dysplasia. Fifty patients whose initial Papanicolaou smears were interpreted as showing atypia less than dysplasia were evaluated for the presence of HPV 16 DNA in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells and for histologic findings on biopsy. Those 50 patients were compared to two groups of patients: one consisting of 124 patients with biopsy-documented cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and another of 112 patients with normal Papanicolaou smears. The presence of HPV 16 DNA was confirmed with Southern analysis in 46% of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears, 46% with confirmed CIN and 11.6% with normal Papanicolaou smears. The 50 patients with atypical smears underwent colposcopically directed cervical biopsies, revealing the following results: 14 (28%) had normal histology, 29 (58%) had koilocytosis without dysplasia, and 7 (14%) had CIN. HPV 16 DNA was present in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells from a large percentage of patients from each category (50% of patients with normal histology, 41.2% with koilocytosis and 57% with CIN). HPV 16 DNA screening did not predict which patients with atypical smears had underlying CIN. Colposcopically directed biopsy remains the evaluation method of choice.",339,1
"Ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of supraclavicular lymph nodes in patients with esophageal carcinoma. The use of ultrasound combined with ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (UGFAB) of supraclavicular lymph nodes in the pretreatment staging of 37 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is described. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and the abdomen and ultrasound of the abdomen and supraclavicular regions. Supraclavicular lymph node metastases (Stage IV disease according to the tumor nodes metastasis [TNM] classification) were cytologically diagnosed in seven (18.9%) of the 37 patients. In two of these patients, no other metastases were found. In the other five patients, UGFAB replaced more invasive diagnostic procedures. Due to their superficial location, ultrasound and UGFAB of the supraclavicular lymph nodes was relatively simple to perform, and contributed to an improved staging of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.",203,1
"Outcome of hepatitis B virus infection in homosexual men and its relation to prior human immunodeficiency virus infection. To investigate the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on subsequent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HIV antibody was sought in homosexual men who developed HBV infection during a hepatitis B vaccine trial. Among 134 unvaccinated HIV-1-negative men, 7% became HBV carriers, 64% had viremia, and 42% had clinical illness. Among vaccinated HIV-1-negative men, HBV infection severity decreased with number of vaccine doses administered. When adjusted for prior hepatitis B vaccination status, persons with HIV-1 infection preceding HBV infection had a significantly higher risk of developing HBV carriage, viremia, prolonged ALT elevation, and clinical illness. Among HIV-1-infected men, the risk of HBV carriage was increased in unvaccinated persons (21%) and those who failed to respond to vaccination (31%) and further increased in those who received vaccine doses at the time they developed new HBV infection (56%-80%), suggesting inactivated hepatitis B vaccine may temporarily impair the immune response to HBV infection in HIV-1-infected persons. HIV-1 infection was also associated with reduced alanine aminotransferase elevations during the first 36 months of follow-up of men who became HBV carriers.",277,0
"Disturbances in the cerebral perfusion of human immune deficiency virus-1 seropositive asymptomatic subjects: a quantitative tomography study of 18 cases. Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by xenon-133 (133Xe) tomography, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests, and laboratory analyses were performed on 18 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive asymptomatic subjects. Abnormalities of cerebral perfusion were observed in 16 cases (88%). These abnormalities were particularly frequent in the frontal regions (77% of cases). MRI demonstrated leucoencephalopathy in only two cases. EEG showed only induced diffuse abnormalities in two cases. Psychometric tests showed restricted moderate disturbances in 55% of patients. These disturbances mostly concerned those sectors involved in cognitive functions and memorization. These results indicate that quantitative measurements of CBF by 133Xe-SPECT is capable of detecting abnormalities of cerebral perfusion at a very early stage (Phase II) of HIV-1 infection. These abnormalities are indications of disturbances resulting from unidentified metabolic or vascular lesions. This technique appears to be superior to MRI at this stage of the disease's development. It could provide objective information leading to earlier treatment, and prove useful in evaluating potential antiviral chemotherapy.",270,0
"Substantia nigra: a site of action of muscle relaxant drugs. Sites of action of centrally active muscle relaxant drugs are not well defined. Clinical experience with such drugs suggests that the spinal cord may be one of the important regions from which pathologically increased muscle tone may be relieved. Supraspinal centers that may also be involved in the expression of muscle relaxant action have not yet been defined. We report here that microinjections of therapeutically relevant muscle relaxants into the midbrain tegmentum of genetically spastic rats decrease muscle tone. The substantia nigra is the region from which midazolam, baclofen, and tizanidine (drugs used clinically in the treatment of spasticity), or gamma-vinyl-GABA, (-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, and [D-pro2-D-phe7-D-trp9]-substance P (experimental drugs active in animal models of spasticity), reduce muscle tone in genetically spastic rats and Hoffmann reflexes in normal rats. The effects of muscle relaxant drugs are topographically restricted to the substantia nigra pars reticulata and are receptor specific. These observations disclose a previously unknown function of the substantia nigra in mediating muscle relaxation.",253,0

"Cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors. The authors studied data of combination assays of tumor markers, because simultaneous elevation of different types of tumor markers in the serum was puzzling. They interpreted such phenomena regarding cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors. The tissue expression of the antigens was compared with preoperative serum levels. Several different factors were found to cause the simultaneous elevation of two or three of these markers in the serum. Furthermore, even when the levels of some of the tumor markers were raised in the serum, the ovarian tumor did not always produce the marker by itself. This study indicates that immunohistochemical identification of a marker in tumor tissue is prerequisite to the use of that marker in the serum to monitor disease status.",175,1
"Hypercalcemia in malignancy. The pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in malignancy has been enigmatic until recent years. Since the realization in 1980 that bioassays for parathyroid hormone detected a cross-reacting substance in malignancy, progress has been remarkably rapid. A parathyroid hormone-related protein was purified and identified by molecular cloning as a 141-amino acid peptide with limited homology to parathyroid hormone itself. Nonetheless, both peptides activate the parathyroid hormone receptor to produce hypercalcemia. It is now clear that the parathyroid hormone-related protein is the cause of hypercalcemia in most solid tumors, particularly squamous and renal carcinomas. New assays for the hormone as well as the related peptide have greatly simplified the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia. At the same time, new agents for the treatment of hypercalcemia are becoming available, most notably the bisphosphonate drugs.",183,1
"Prognostic factors in alcoholic liver disease. VA Cooperative Study Group. Two hundred eighty-one alcoholic patients were prospectively evaluated by clinical, biochemical, and histologic parameters during a 4-yr period to assess their prognosis. They were stratified into four categories of injury: 1) fatty liver (26 patients), 2) acute alcoholic hepatitis (106), 3) cirrhosis (39), and 4) cirrhosis with superimposed alcoholic hepatitis (111). The rate of survival and variables correlating with survival varied according to the group. At 48 months, 70% of the patients with fatty liver were alive, 58% in the alcoholic hepatitis group, 49% in cirrhosis, and 35% in alcoholic hepatitis superimposed upon cirrhosis. Within group one, deaths were due to causes unrelated to liver disease. In the alcoholic hepatitis group, factors significantly correlating with survival were ascites, alanine amino-transferase levels, grams of alcohol consumed, continuation of alcohol intake, and clinical severity of disease. Survival in patients of group three correlated significantly with prothrombin time and histologic severity score. Patients with combined cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis exhibited the worst prognosis, with the most significant predictors of survival being age, grams of alcohol consumed, the ratio of serum aminotransferases (AST:ALT) and the histologic and clinical severity of the disease. Although a different pattern of correlates was observed for each pathologic level of injury, knowledge of the various correlates aids in prognostic assessment.",310,0
"Needs and recommendations for behavior research in the prevention and early detection of cancer. Because life-style patterns affect many cancer risks, research on health-risk behavior and behavior change is critical to cancer prevention. This report recommends priorities for the next decade of psychosocial research on cancer prevention and detection. The leading priority for future research is to fill gaps in basic knowledge left by the rush to intervention and outcome studies. Such research must be theoretically driven and should aim to develop broad principles applicable to diverse health behaviors. Studies that include relevant process data on various stages of behavior change are considered more desirable than simple outcome studies. Epidemiologic investigations should be expanded to include measures of relevant behaviors, so that their impact on clinical outcomes might be established. More research is needed on lay perception of health risks and on individual and health-system barriers to effective cancer prevention and detection. Studies that address the needs of minority and underprivileged populations are crucial. Funding agencies' narrow categorical mandates impede interdisciplinary research on multiple risk factors and their interactions; these boundaries must be relaxed to promote such approaches. Funding agencies should also consider basic research as a long-term investment towards the development of effective interventions. ",233,1
"Protection from chemotherapy-induced alopecia in a rat model. Alopecia (hair loss) is among the most distressing side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Little progress has been made, however, in its prevention or treatment, partly because of the lack of suitable experimental model. In recent work on the treatment of myelogenous leukemia in the rat, the following observations were made: (i) treatment of 8-day-old rats with cytosine arabinoside consistently produced alopecia, and (ii) ImuVert, a biologic response modifier derived from the bacterium Serratia marcescens, uniformly produced complete protection against the alopecia. In subsequent experiments, both cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin also produced alopecia in this model, and the doxorubicin-induced alopecia was prevented by treatment with ImuVert. The potential relevance of these observations to chemotherapy-induced alopecia in the clinical setting should be examined.",189,1

"Management of pseudarthrosis after arthrodesis of the spine for idiopathic scoliosis. Sixty-three first, second, or third-time repairs of one or more pseudarthroses were done in fifty-one patients who had had an arthrodesis for idiopathic scoliosis. Forty-five of the patients were female and six were male. The average age was 30.2 years. The indications for the sixty-three repairs were pain (twenty-five repairs), progression of the curve (sixteen), both pain and progression of the curve (twelve), and radiographic changes only (ten). Failure of the implant was identified before 27 per cent of the sixty-three procedures. The pseudarthroses were diagnosed an average of 2.8 years after the initial arthrodeses. Sixty-eight per cent of the defects were visible on plain radiographs preoperatively and 32 per cent were identified at operation. During the time between the original arthrodeses and the repairs of the pseudarthroses, the scolioses increased by a mean of 7 degrees and the kyphoses, by a mean of 10 degrees. Harrington distraction was the most commonly used instrumentation (twenty-six [41 per cent] of the sixty-three procedures), and autogenous iliac bone was the most commonly used material for the graft (thirty-three [52 per cent] of the procedures).",294,0
"Different patterns of gene expression in ras-resistant and ras-sensitive cells. We have shown previously that nontumorigenic NIH 3T3 cells can be made tumorigenic and metastatic by transfection and expression of activated ras, whereas in LTA cells, which are tumorigenic but nonmetastatic, the degree of malignancy is not altered by ras. To investigate possible mechanisms of natural ras resistance, we compared the expression patterns of several genes thought to be involved in ras-induced metastatic progression in LTA (ras-resistant) and NIH 3T3 (ras-sensitive) cells, before and after constitutive expression of transfected T24-H-ras. We examined the expression of the nuclear ""early-response"" genes jun and fos and the ""tumor-suppressor"" retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, as well as genes involved in invasion (major excreted protein [MEP], tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases [TIMP]), and cell adhesion (secreted phosphoprotein 1 [SPP1; also known as osteopontin]). We found distinct differences in both the basal and ras-induced levels of expression of most of these genes in LTA versus NIH 3T3 cells. High levels of MEP and low levels of TIMP were induced in ras-transfected NIH 3T3 cells, whereas LTA cells showed intermediate levels of MEP and high levels of TIMP that were only marginally affected by the expression of transfected ras. Similarly, SPP1 expression was strongly induced by ras in NIH 3T3 cells but was repressed by ras in LTA cells. Enzymogram assays for functional gelatinase activity showed an increase in 67-kd and 62-kd bands in NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of ras. LTA cells showed no gelatinolytic activity in the presence or absence of ras. Data from an in vitro assay for chemoinvasiveness showed a pattern as predicted from the expression of invasion-related genes; chemoinvasiveness in ras-transfected NIH 3T3 was greater than in LTA and ras-transfected LTA cells, which was greater than in NIH 3T3 cells. Differences in expression of the genes examined are believed to contribute to the ras responsiveness of NIH 3T3 cells and the ras resistance of LTA cells.",476,1
"Tuberculous peritonitis: a study comparing cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. Tuberculous peritonitis is a rare disease, which often goes unrecognized because of the subtle clinical clues and its insidous onset. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 37 cases of tuberculous peritonitis diagnosed over a 15-year period, and compared the clinical and diagnostic features of cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. In cirrhotic patients, tuberculous peritonitis can simulate ascites from liver disease or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The diagnosis is difficult in these patients because the ascitic fluid may not be of the exudative type as a result of the low albumin level in serum, and lymphocytes do not predominate in all cases. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in ascitic fluid was elevated (higher than 40 U/L) in all 11 patients (four patients with hepatic cirrhosis). The time required to achieve a correct diagnosis was significantly longer in cirrhotic than in noncirrhotic patients. The overall mortality was 13%, with deaths occurring exclusively among cirrhotic patients. We emphasize that tuberculous peritonitis in cirrhotic patients can present an atypical picture. A considerable element of suspicion is necessary.",258,0
"Diagnostic imaging and surgical treatment of dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. We describe the diagnostic procedures and surgical approaches employed in 5 patients with dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately described the existence and longitudinal extension of the intraspinal component of the tumor and assisted in choosing the appropriate surgical approach. Both the intrathoracic and intraspinal components of the tumor were resected at one time by a thoracic and neurosurgical team. We employed the Grillo technique three times and a separate laminectomy and thoracotomy approach. Magnetic resonance imaging proved the most useful diagnostic technique for suspected dumbbell mediastinal tumors. In our experience, the extended thoracotomy proposed by Grillo and co-workers worked well for small tumors involving only one foramen in which the intraspinal extension was limited to 2 to 3 cm, and when no more than two laminectomies were required. On the other hand, thoracotomy and a longitudinal paravertebral incision are preferable for larger tumors (more than 4 cm) involving more than one foramen in which the intraspinal extension exceeds 2 to 3 cm, for tumors requiring multiple laminectomy, and when bony infiltration is present.",245,0
"Stunned myocardium and myocardial collagen damage: differential effects of single and repeated occlusions. It has been suggested that collagen loss and damage is responsible for the dysfunction seen in stunned myocardium. To test this hypothesis we compared collagen in canine hearts stunned by repeated occlusion with collagen in hearts stunned by a single occlusion. Regional contractile function was equally depressed in both groups: segment shortening at 1 hour after reperfusion averaged 37% +/- 9% versus 32% +/- 9% of preocclusion values in repeated and single occlusion models, respectively. Midmyocardial collagen content was not different in either single occlusion (10.5% +/- 0.4%) or repeated occlusion models (9.5% +/- 0.7%) when compared with nonischemic hearts (8.5 +/- 0.8%). Collagen damage, which was revealed with polarized light microscopy, was seen in 5 of 6 dogs after repeated occlusion but was not apparent after a single occlusion. Thus although both models of stunned myocardium produce similar dysfunction, there was no apparent collagen loss. Furthermore, collagen damage was only seen after repeated occlusion. Therefore it appears unlikely that collagen damage is a primary mechanism of stunned myocardium.",248,0
"Evolution of energy expenditure and nitrogen excretion in severe head-injured patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of therapeutic changes on the level of energy expenditure (EE) and N excretion in a homogeneous group of patients usually considered hypermetabolic. DESIGN: EE and N excretion of head-injured patients were measured simultaneously at phases 1 and 2 (patients treated 4 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 8 days after injury, respectively). SETTING: Acute care hospital. PATIENTS: Eight severe head-injured patients, mean weight 63.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) kg, mean age 21 +/- 3.8 (SD) yr. INTERVENTIONS: At phase 1, all patients were sedated with fentanyl (6.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/kg.hr) plus flunitrazepam (9.1 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg.hr) and were mechanically ventilated. All patients received continuous total parenteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1092 +/- 200 kcal/day, including 77% glucose and 23% fat (Intralipid 20%). The total N intake averaged 7 +/- 5 g/day, consisting of crystalline amino acids. At phase 2, no patient received any sedative and all were breathing spontaneously via tracheostomy. All patients received parenteral and/or enteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1929 +/- 200 kcal/day consisting of 65% carbohydrates and 35% fat. The total N intake averaged 13 +/- 2 g/day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The EE was significantly higher at phase 2 than at phase 1 (2121 vs. 1737 kcal), but the interindividual variability was low at both phases. N excretion was high at the two periods of the study and not correlated to the level of EE. The RQ was 0.75 at both periods, indicating predominant fat oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any parallelism in the evolution of EE and protein catabolism in head-injured patients. The therapeutics (mechanical ventilation, sedation, and nutrition) have a major effect on EE but little on N excretion.",480,0
"Vitamin E in gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion. To clarify the relationship among vitamin E, oxygen radicals, and lipid peroxidation in ischemia-reperfusion, we produced an experimental model of gastric mucosal injury in rats by ischemia-reperfusion with clamping of the celiac artery and measurements of the area of gastric erosion, thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substances, and alpha-tocopherol in serum and gastric mucosa during ischemia-reperfusion. The area of gastric erosions and TBA-reactive substances in gastric mucosa were significantly increased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. The serum alpha-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and gastric mucosal alpha-tocopherol were significantly decreased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. On the other hand, in vitamin E-deficient rats, gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion was more severe than that in vitamin E-nondeficient rats. These results indicate that vitamin E is consumed in the process of lipid peroxidation induced by oxygen radicals in ischemia-reperfusion to prevent the development of tissue damage.",229,0
Magnetic resonance imaging of radiation optic neuropathy. Three patients with delayed radiation optic neuropathy after radiation therapy for parasellar neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The affected optic nerves and chiasms showed enlargement and focal gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement. The magnetic resonance imaging technique effectively detected and defined anterior visual pathway changes of radionecrosis and excluded the clinical possibility of visual loss because of tumor recurrence. ,82,1
"The role of aspiration cytologic examination in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast. A study of 2,000 patients who had undergone fine needle aspiration of a solid lump of the breast was conducted to determine the accuracy of this technique. During the period 1982 to 1989, all patients with a solid mammary mass, presenting to a specialized breast unit were initially investigated by fine needle aspiration cytologic examination (FNAC). To date, we present data on 2,000 consecutive aspirations with matching histologic diagnosis on the excised pathologic specimens. In particular, the relationship between tumor histologic factors and the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis was examined. The sensitivity of FNAC in the diagnosis of a malignant growth was 84 per cent; this represents first aspiration results only. The specificity was more than 99 per cent. The rate of acellular or unsatisfactory aspirations was 12 per cent. We had a positive predictive rate for diagnosis in carcinoma of the breast of almost 95 per cent. The diagnosis of lobular and in situ patterns of disease was questioned, with three of three in situ lesions and ten of 23 lobular lesions missed by FNAC. We do not recommend that FNAC replace excision biopsy and frozen section in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast.",271,1
"Implementation of cancer prevention guidelines in clinical practice. Data from several sources, including consumer surveys, physician surveys, and medical record audits, indicate that consumers do not receive cancer screening tests as recommended by the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Performance rates are consistently below published standards for all tests except Pap tests. Major reasons physicians do not perform the recommended tests include physician forgetfulness, disagreement with recommendations, lack of time, and patient refusal. Physicians also tend to overestimate their own performance rates. Barriers to screening test performance can be categorized into patient factors, physician factors, test factors, and health care delivery system factors. Interventions, such as computerized reminder systems, physician audits with feedback, and patient education and reminders, can be effective in promoting performance of such screening. Interventions that target both physician and patient may be particularly effective. ",178,1
"Postischemic seizures and necrotizing ischemic brain damage: neuroprotective effect of postischemic diazepam and insulin. Insulin has recently been shown experimentally to modify ischemic brain damage when administered either before or after the episode of ischemia. In controlled studies in the rat, high doses of insulin (greater than or equal to 8 IU/kg) result in seizures and early death. The present study was undertaken to determine whether diazepam, a potent, centrally penetrating GABAmimetic, alone or in combination with insulin, could mitigate postischemic seizures or regional selective neuronal necrosis and infarction. Forebrain ischemia was induced in rats for 10 1/2 minutes by carotid clamping and hypotension. The animals were observed clinically until elective perfusion-fixation and quantitative pathologic examination at 1-week recovery. Diazepam, either alone or with insulin, reduced regional brain necrosis and reduced the seizure rate. Insulin alone also led to reduced regional necrosis. However, the combination of diazepam plus insulin yielded the greatest proportion of undamaged brains in the hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain. In the neocortex, the diazepam-only group showed the greatest number of normal hemispheres. Hypothalamic infarction was eliminated by all three treatments. Seizures per se were associated with increased damage in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, irrespective of treatment group. The findings indicate that ischemic brain necrosis can be mitigated by diazepam and insulin treatment begun in the immediate postischemic period.",299,0
"Pigmented spindle cell naevus. We report 22 cases of pigmented spindle cell naevus (PSCN). The usual appearance of these naevi is that of a heavily pigmented papule found mostly on the legs of young patients. Histologically, PSCN was characterized by symmetrical proliferation of spindle-shaped pigmented melanocytes grouped in large junctional nests. Pagetoid spread of single cells in the overlying epidermis was frequently found. In our opinion, PSCN is a distinctive benign acquired melanocytic naevus that in the past has been frequently misdiagnosed as atypical Spitz naevi or malignant melanoma.",123,1
"Superiority of transesophageal echocardiography in detecting cardiac source of embolism in patients with cerebral ischemia of uncertain etiology. The diagnostic yield of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography for identifying a cardiac source of embolism was compared in 79 patients presenting with unexplained stroke or transient ischemic attack. There were 35 men and 44 women with a mean age of 59 years (range 17 to 84); 52% had clinical cardiac disease. Both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms were performed using Doppler color flow and contrast imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography identified a potential cardiac source of embolism in 57% of the overall study group compared with only 15% by transthoracic echocardiography (p less than 0.0005). Compared with transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography more frequently identified atrial septal aneurysm associated with a patent foramen ovale (9 versus 1 of 79 patients, p less than 0.005), left atrial thrombus or tumor (6 versus 0 of 79 patients, p less than 0.05) and left atrial spontaneous contrast (13 versus 0 of 79 patients, p less than 0.0005). All cases of left atrial thrombus or spontaneous contrast were identified in patients with clinically identified cardiac disease. In the 38 patients with no cardiac disease, transesophageal echocardiography identified isolated atrial septal aneurysm and atrial septal aneurysm with a patent foramen ovale more frequently than transthoracic echocardiography (8 versus 2 of 38 patients, p less than 0.05). The two techniques had a similar rate of identifying apical thrombus and mitral valve prolapse. Overall, transesophageal echocardiography identified abnormalities in 39% of patients with no cardiac disease versus 19% for transthoracic echocardiography (p less than 0.005). Thus, transesophageal echocardiography identifies potential cardiac sources of embolism in the majority of patients presenting with unexplained stroke.",430,0
"The expression of progesterone receptors coincides with an arrest of DNA synthesis in human breast cancer. Two main models to account for the heterogeneous expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in human breast cancer have been proposed: the clonal model and the stem cell model. The authors previously provided evidence supporting the stem cell model since it was found that most of the proliferating cells in ER-positive (ER+) human breast cancer lack ER and that the ER-negative (ER-) and ER+ subpopulations are interrelated. The authors have analyzed in eighteen ER+/PR+ primary breast tumors the simultaneous expression of ER or PR (by immunohistochemistry) and DNA synthesis (by autoradiography) after 30 minutes of 3H-thymidine incorporation. The authors demonstrated that: (1) the average numbers of ER+ and PR+ cells were similar (36.8 +/- 10.7% and 39.3 +/- 17.6%, respectively); (2) The thymidine-labeling indexes of the ER+, ER-, PR+, and PR- subpopulations were 0.53 +/- 0.69%, 0.74 +/- 0.49%, 0.21 +/- 0.21 and 0.94 +/- 0.54%, respectively; and (3) 75.2% of the DNA-synthesizing cells were ER-, and 88.8% of them were PR-. The authors conclude that the cellular subpopulations expressing ER and PR were not identical, and the expression of PR was associated with a lower rate of cellular proliferation than was ER expression.",341,1
"Regional differences in the intranodal distribution of tumor cells. The intranodal distribution of tumor cells was examined in 103 mesenteric and 135 axillary nodes to determine the frequency of a circumferential type of distribution and its relationship, if any, to central necrosis. Eighteen percent of the mesenteric nodes removed at surgery from patients with colon cancer contained a circumferential rim of viable tumor cells in an area corresponding wholly or in part to the normal location of the marginal sinus. In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern. These findings suggest that by interrupting blood and lymph vessels, the circumferential spread of tumor cells underlies development of central necrosis. Previously described structural dissimilarities between mesenteric and axillary nodes may explain the striking difference in incidence of this pattern in these nodes.",186,1
"Screening for neuroblastoma at 3 weeks of age: methods and preliminary results from the Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project. A large neuroblastoma screening study was recently started in the province of Quebec, Canada. This project, a collaboration between the Quebec Network for Genetic Medicine and the University of Minnesota, is studying the impact of screening infants for the preclinical detection of neuroblastoma on the population-based mortality caused by this tumor. All infants born in Quebec during a 5-year period will be screened twice, at 3 weeks and at 6 months. Urinary homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid determination from dried filter paper samples is used for screening. Initial qualitative screening is done by means of thin-layer chromatography with confirmatory quantitative screening by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). During the initial 6 months of 3-week screening, 41,673 neonates (92% compliance rate) were screened and 10.6% of them were tested also by GC-MS. Nine of these neonates had positive results on two GC-MS tests and were referred for evaluation to rule out the presence of neuroblastoma. Four had the tumor, 1 had a calcified adrenal gland, and 4 had no tumor detected. Three additional neonates had clinical diagnosis of neuroblastoma before they reached the screening age of 3 weeks. A neuroblastoma that did not secrete homovanillic acid or vanillylmandelic acid was diagnosed clinically in 1 additional patient who tested negative by screening.",323,1
"Follicular thyroid cancer treated at the Mayo Clinic, 1946 through 1970: initial manifestations, pathologic findings, therapy, and outcome We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of all patients who received their primary treatment for follicular thyroid cancer at the Mayo Clinic between 1946 and 1970. The diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. The 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). All patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. Only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. At the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. On the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. Multivariate analysis (by Cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. Patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. These patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. The identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer.",390,1
"Chondrosarcoma of bone in children. Chondrosarcoma of bone rarely occurs in children. This report analyzes the clinicopathologic features in a series of 47 patients with conventional chondrosarcoma who were less than 17 years of age. Of the 47 cases, 14 were from the Mayo Clinic files, and 33 were from our consultation files. Most of the lesions occurred in the trunk and upper ends of the long bones, with the humerus being the most frequent skeletal site. Twelve of the 47 tumors were secondary. The radiographic findings were the same as those seen in adult chondrosarcoma. Pathologically, the tumors were low grade. En bloc resection is the treatment of choice because of the high incidence of local recurrence with lesser surgical margins. Prognosis in childhood chondrosarcoma is no different from that in adult chondrosarcoma. None of the patients with follow-up data had metastasis.",193,1
"Overexpression of HER-2/neu in endometrial cancer is associated with advanced stage disease. Prior studies have shown that overexpression of HER-2/neu occurs in one third of breast and ovarian cancers and that overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. We used a monoclonal antibody to assess immunohistochemically the level of HER-2/neu expression in normal and malignant endometrium. In 24 normal endometrial samples light to moderate (1+ to 2+) staining for HER-2/neu was seen in the glands, and there was no variation in intensity of staining during the menstrual cycle. Among 95 endometrial adenocarcinomas, nine (9%) were found to have heavier staining for HER-2/neu than was seen in normal endometrium (3+). High expression of HER-2/neu was found in 27% of patients with metastatic disease compared with 4% of patients with disease confined to the uterus (p less than 0.005). High HER-2/neu expression also was associated with absence of estrogen receptor (p less than 0.005) and with increased mortality from cancer. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of HER-2/neu overexpression in endometrial cancer.",253,1
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa. Specimens of normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa from 52 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry using a monospecific polyclonal antiserum against human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI). In normal colonic mucosa PSTI was found in the goblet cells in the basal parts of the crypts. In adenomas of tubular, villous, and tubulo-villous types PSTI was also found in the upper parts of the polyps, usually occurring in the regeneration zone. There was a more intense staining reaction in polyps with increased atypia. Carcinomas of different types and of various grades of differentiation and of in situ type did not contain PSTI. These findings indicate that PSTI could be a marker for adenomatous rather than carcinomatous epithelium in the colon. Furthermore, the absence of the inhibitor in malignant cells might facilitate tissue invasion by malignant cells because of deficient protease inhibition.",195,0
"Myotonic heart disease: a clinical follow-up. We followed 37 patients with myotonic dystrophy for a mean of 6 years. Two developed atrial flutter or fibrillation, 6 developed a new bundle branch block, 1 developed complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and another with progressive 1st-degree heart block and a widening QRS interval had a sudden death. Most patients had predictable, gradually progressive disease of their cardiac conduction system. We recommend that patients with progressive atrioventricular block or widening QRS interval due to myotonic heart disease have yearly ECGs and be questioned about syncope or presyncope to determine the need for a cardiac pacemaker.",137,0

"A new DNA marker (D10S94) very tightly linked to the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) locus. Combined somatic cell hybrid and linkage studies between D10S94 and five pericentromeric loci (FNRB, D10Z1, MEN2A, RBP3, and D10S15) have localized the new DNA sequence pcl1/A1S-6-c23 at D10S94 to 10q11.2. No recombinants were observed between D10S94 and D10Z1 or MEN2A. D10S94 maps in proximal 10q11.2 very near to MEN2A. There are three possible orders for the six loci that we investigated from the centromeric region of chromosome 10. At present the genetic data do not allow us to order MEN2A with respect to D10Z1 and D10S94. The three possible orders are FNRB-D10Z1-D10S94-MEN2A-RBP3-D10S15, FNRB-D10Z1-MEN2A-D10S94-RBP3-D10S15, and FNRB-MEN2A-D10Z1-D10S94-RBP3-D10S15. In view of the fact that no recombinants between D10S94 and MEN2A or between D10S94 and D10Z1 were observed, the combined haplotypes formed from RFLPs and D10Z1 and D10S94 will increase the informativeness and accuracy of genotype prediction for at-risk members of the families having the MEN 2A syndrome, particularly when the affected parent is female. The localization of D10S94 with respect to MEN2A will prove valuable in experiments directed toward cloning the MEN2A locus.",444,1
"Immunocytochemical localization of progesterone receptors in endocrine cells of the human pancreas. Progesterone receptors (PgR) have been immunocytochemically localized in the nuclei of several (40% to 75%) endocrine cells of the human pancreas and in a more variable number of neoplastic cells of 7 of 18 endocrine pancreatic tumors. Conversely the exocrine epithelial cells of the pancreas did not exhibit any PgR immunoreactivity in normal as well as in different pathologic conditions, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Estrogen receptors were not detected in any of the pancreatic samples investigated. Double immunocytochemical experiments have documented that PgR immunoreactivity in normal Langerhans islets is a consistent feature of most (75%) glucagon-producing A cells, of approximately 5% to 20% of insulin-producing B cells, and of a variable percentage of pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-producing cells, ranging from 5% to 70%. These figures were not affected by the sex, age, or underlying disease of the patients. The reported findings corroborate previous clinical and experimental evidence indicating that sex steroid hormones may have some regulatory effects on the functional activity of the endocrine pancreas.",244,1

"Effect of nimodipine on acute ischemic stroke. Pooled results from five randomized trials. In a review of pooled data from five double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of nimodipine in acute ischemic stroke, we compared the effect of 120 mg nimodipine given orally with that of placebo. In the five studies, 871 patients were followed, and 781 adhered to entry and inclusion criteria. End points were mortality and outcome at the end of the treatment period (21 or 28 days). Outcome was assessed with Mathew's scale and the physician's clinical judgement. The treatment and control groups were well matched with respect to demographic data, risk factors, and baseline Mathew scores. In the treatment group, 34 patients (7.9%) died during the treatment period, whereas 54 (12.3%) in the control group died, corresponding with a mortality reduction of 36%. Significantly less neurologic impairment at the end of the treatment period was documented under nimodipine treatment, and this impairment improved more in patients with moderate-to-severe stroke (baseline Mathew score less than 66) if administration of nimodipine occurred within 12 hours after stroke onset or if the patient was more than 65 years old. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was relatively modest, and these were of minor severity; only a few appeared to have more than a remote relation to the study medication.",305,0
Ampullary hamartoma: endoscopic diagnosis and treatment. This study shows a patient who presented with intermittent biliary tract obstruction caused by ampullary hamartoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed a large ulcerated papilla and dilated biliary ducts. Tissue diagnosis was established by a large particle biopsy obtained with a snare. The patient underwent a successful endoscopic sphincterotomy and has remained symptom free for 4 years.,86,1
"Risk factors for transmission of hepatitis B virus to Gambian children [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Dec 22-29;336(8730):1596] Risk factors for hepatitis B virus transmission were examined in 973 Gambian children aged 6 months to 5 years. 33% had evidence of infection with hepatitis B virus and a third of these were carriers. A significant association was found between infection and tropical ulcer scars, and between e antigenaemia and the presence of bedbugs in each child's bed. There was no association between infection and traditional scarring, circumcision, or injections. Skin disease and arthropods are the two most likely modes of transmission of hepatitis B virus between children in West Africa.",162,0
"Recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevus. A benign lesion, not to be mistaken for malignant melanoma. Melanocytic nevi that recur after incomplete removal are pigmented lesions that may clinically and pathologically simulate malignant melanoma in situ. Five examples of recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevus, with emphasis on light microscopic and immunohistochemical findings, are reported herein. Prominent HMB-45 staining in these nevi may cause further confusion in differentiating them from malignant melanoma. The differential diagnosis of recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevi is discussed, with particular emphasis on distinguishing these lesions from malignant melanoma. Our immunohistochemical observations indicate that the recurrences most likely develop as a result of proliferation of melanocytes remaining in the epidermis and/or adnexae following incomplete removal. The approach and management of recurrent nevi are also discussed.",162,1
"Clinical and instrumental evaluation of sensory function before and after percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy at cervical level in man. Sensory perception thresholds were assessed by clinical testing and by quantitative instrumental testing before and after operation in 16 subjects for whom unilateral percutaneous cervical cordotomy was performed for the relief of pain due to malignant disease, and compared with clinical assessments of sensory function. We were able to confirm the association between deficit in pin-prick sensation and pain relief in the majority of instances, though the completeness or otherwise of pain relief does not correspond to absence of pin-prick sensation. There is no objective interference with low threshold mechanical sensation as measured instrumentally, although cordotomised subjects do not experience startle, tickle, or cutaneous erotic sensation when subjected to appropriate low intensity tactile sensation. Quantitative instrumental testing shows that the greatest deficits produced by cordotomy are in the sensations of skinfold pinch (? = tissue-damage pain) and skin cooling. The latter is transduced in the periphery by A delta fibres; sensations of warmth and hot pain, transduced by primary afferent C fibres, are much less significantly affected. Our findings thus fail to resolve the question as to whether chronic clinical pain is mainly an A delta- or a C fibre-mediated phenomenon.",254,0
"Flow cytometric evaluation of chemosensitive and chemoresistant head and neck tumors. For patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma, a clinical response to induction chemotherapy has correlated with a survival advantage. Similarly, patients with diploid tumors have displayed a survival advantage when compared with patients with aneuploid tumors. This study examined DNA content in 33 patients who had undergone induction chemotherapy as part of two clinical protocols to determine if there was a correlation between the patients with diploid tumors and the patients with a clinical response to chemotherapy. Although patients with stage III tumors had a longer disease-free survival than stage IV patients (p less than 0.0002), the addition of DNA content information did not improve the ability to predict response. Specifically, there was no correlation between DNA content and the response to chemotherapy. In addition, for this group of patients, a diploid DNA content was not correlated with a survival advantage. We conclude that DNA content information did not add significantly to the prediction of clinical outcome in these patients who received induction chemotherapy.",209,1
"An analysis of outcome following percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty. An autopsy series. We analyzed autopsy findings on 26 patients who died following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Twenty-one patients died within 3 weeks of undergoing PTCA; demonstrable cardiac complications were found in 19 patients: platelet-fibrin thrombi (10 patients [48%]), coronary artery dissections (17 patients [81%]), thromboemboli (13 patients [62%]), atheroemboli (seven patients [33%]), and myocardial infarcts (17 patients [81%]). An increased incidence of coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi was noted when compared with a non-PTCA cardiac autopsy population (five of 53 patients). Apparently there was an increased incidence of coronary atheroemboli and thromboemboli in the patients with coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi (eight patients) when compared with patients who did not have platelet-fibrin thrombi (five patients), although this was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of a systemic hypercoagulable state or of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The pathogenesis of this is unclear; however, vasospasm and a disruption of the endothelial surface induced by PTCA with subsequent platelet activation are possible causes. Although not statistically significant, there was a proponderance of female subjects (seven patients) and an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus (six patients) and hypertension (13 patients) when compared with a control population of all patients undergoing PTCA at The Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation in 1987, suggesting that diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and female sex may be clinical risk factors for fatal complications following PTCA.",361,0
"Complications of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap in head and neck reconstruction. A retrospective review of the complications in 211 patients undergoing pectoralis major myocutaneous flap reconstruction is presented. The flap was used for mucosal lining of the oral cavity or oropharynx in 109 patients, for pharyngoesophageal reconstruction in 44, for skin coverage in 47, and for other locations in 14 patients. Flap-related complications developed in 63% of the patients. These included flap necrosis, suture line dehiscence, fistula formation, infection, and hematoma. Analysis of risk factors for the development of flap complications showed the following factors to be significant: age over 70; female gender; nomographic overweight; albumin less than 4 g/dL; use of the flap in reconstruction of the oral cavity after major glossectomy; and presence of other systemic diseases. The median length of hospitalization for those developing complications was 33 days compared with 16 days for those who did not develop any complications. Thirty-five (26%) of the 135 patients developing complications required reoperation and only 2 among these required a second flap. Similarly, only 13 of the 61 patients who developed fistulas required surgical closure.",271,1
"Feasibility of reversing benzodiazepine tolerance with flumazenil To examine whether the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can reverse tolerance to benzodiazepines but without precipitating withdrawal seizures, the antiepileptic effect of flumazenil itself and its ability to reverse tolerance at a dose that would leave sufficient receptors free for the binding of benzodiazepines were investigated. Electroencephalographic studies in 6 patients with partial and 6 with generalised seizures showed that flumazenil had a short (20 min) non-dose-dependent suppressant effect on epileptic discharges in those with partial seizures. Receptor occupancy studies in 12 patients showed that 1.5 mg flumazenil given intravenously occupied 55% receptors, whereas 15 mg occupied nearly all receptors. When 3 patients with partial seizures who had become tolerant to clonazepam were given 1.5 mg flumazenil, they were seizure-free for 6-21 days after the injection. The value of intermittent therapy with a benzodiazepine antagonist for preventing or reversing tolerance to benzodiazepine agonists ought to be investigated further.",235,0
"Granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an epidural mass with acute paraparesis in an aleukemic patient. Granulocytic sarcomas are rare tumors composed of granulocytic precursor cells. They are most commonly encountered in patients with acute myelogenous leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders in blast crisis. Rarely, patients presenting with granulocytic sarcoma show no evidence of acute leukemia. The authors report an aleukemic patient with acute paraparesis from an epidural granulocytic sarcoma. Only five such cases have been reported previously. Immunoperoxidase stain for lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase stain were used to prove the myeloid origin of the tumor cells. ",134,1
"Tissue distribution of 2-3 and 2-6 sialyl Lewis A antigens and significance of the ratio of two antigens for the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign disorders of the digestive tract. The authors investigated the tissue distribution of two kinds of sialylated derivatives of Lewis A (Le(a)) antigen in patients with cancers of the digestive system using specific monoclonal antibodies, and evaluated the significance of determining the 2-3 and 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen levels for the diagnosis of cancer. In most specimens from patients with cancers of the pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon, the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was strongly expressed in cancer cells. However, 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen was less frequently expressed in cancer cells. The former is therefore more specific to cancer than the latter. Also, the serum level of the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen was significantly higher than that of the 2-6 counterpart in patients with cancers of pancreas, biliary tract, stomach, and colon. The resulting ratio of serum 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigens was frequently high in patients with malignancy and was low in patients with benign disorders of these digestive organs. Therefore, the 2-3/2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen ratio is a useful for the differential diagnosis of malignant disorders in these organs. However, liver disorders were found to be exceptional in that both antigens were mostly absent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in immunohistologic examination, as well as in nonmalignant parenchymal liver cells. Only the epithelial cells of the intrahepatic bile ducts expressed the 2-6 sialylated Le(a) antigen strongly, and expressed the 2-3 sialylated Le(a) antigen moderately. The levels of both antigens were sometimes high in patients with liver disorders, but the ratio always remained low in patients with HCC as well as benign liver disorders such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. The sialylated Le(a) antigens, which sometimes accumulate in the sera of patients with HCC, were concluded to originate from the epithelial cells of the proliferating small bile ducts, and those serum antigens cannot be considered as evidence for the presence of liver cancer cells.",479,1
"Characterization and significance of sulfonylurea receptors. This study describes and characterizes a putative sulfonylurea receptor. The radioligand used was [3H]glipizide (9 Ci/mmol). The beta-cell plasma membranes were derived from a transplantable rat insulinoma generated by subcutaneous injection of RINm5F cells and purified by ultracentrifugation on a 15-55% sucrose gradient. Specific binding of [3H]glipizide to purified beta-cell plasma membranes was determined to be maximal at temperatures of 4-23 degrees C, pH 7.3, and an incubation of 2 h. Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site with Kd = 7 nM and sulfonylurea binding of 0.93 pmol/mg membrane protein. Displacement of [3H]glipizide from the purified beta-cell plasma membranes by various sulfonylureas and their analogues correlated well with their known hypoglycemic and insulin-releasing activities. Various agents, including nutrients, agents affecting Ca2+ flux, gastrointestinal hormones, and pancreatic hormones, had no effect on [3H]glipizide binding to the beta-cell plasma membranes. Putative sulfonylurea receptors on beta-cell and brain cell plasma membranes have been reported by several groups of investigators. Sulfonylurea binding to the beta-cell is hypothesized to close an ATP-sensitive K+ channel, which leads to depolarization of the membrane and activation of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel.",321,1
"The evolving pattern of digoxin intoxication: observations at a large urban hospital from 1980 to 1988. Digoxin intoxication has been reported to be a common adverse drug reaction with an in-hospital incidence of 6% to 23% and an associated mortality rate as high as 41%. A retrospective review was conducted to assess the accuracy of diagnosis, the morbidity and mortality of digoxin intoxication, and its incidence in hospitalized patients with heart failure. We reviewed the medical records of 219 patients discharged with the diagnosis of digoxin intoxication between 1980 and 1988. Patients were classified as follows: (1) Definite intoxication--patients with symptoms and/or arrhythmias suggestive of digoxin intoxication that resolved after discontinuation of digoxin; (2) possible intoxication--patients with symptoms and/or arrhythmias suggestive of digoxin intoxication in the absence of documented resolution after discontinuation of digoxin, or the presence of other clinical illnesses that could possibly account for those findings; (3) no intoxication--patients whose symptoms or ECG abnormalities were clearly explained by other associated clinical illnesses and persisted after withdrawal of digoxin. We identified only 43 patients (20%) with definite intoxication. The majority of patients discharged with the diagnosis of digoxin intoxication (133 or 60%) were classified as possibly digoxin intoxicated, and 43 patients (20%) had no clinical evidence to support this diagnosis. To estimate the incidence of digoxin intoxication, we also reviewed the medical records of 994 patients admitted in 1987 with heart failure. Of these, 563 were receiving digoxin and in 27 the diagnosis of digoxin intoxication was made by their clinicians. Our review showed that only four were definitely intoxicated (0.8%), and the diagnosis could not be excluded in another 16 (4%).",392,0
"A randomized trial of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin versus vinblastine, cisplatin, and etoposide in the treatment of advanced germ cell tumors of the testis: a Southwest Oncology Group study This is a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) prospective randomized trial of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB) versus vinblastine, cisplatin, and etoposide (VP-16) (VPV) in the treatment of advanced germ cell tumors of the testis. The study objective was to determine what effect the replacement of bleomycin with VP-16 has on complete response (CR), survival, and drug toxicity. One hundred sixty-nine patients were registered and randomized. Of these patients, 160 were assessable for response. All had histologically confirmed disseminated germ cell neoplasms of testicular origin. Forty-six had minimal metastatic disease, and 114 had maximal disease. Seventy-seven were randomized to PVB and 83 to VPV chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in pretreatment characteristics between the two arms with regard to tumor burden, histologic type, and overall performance status. Patients received four courses of induction chemotherapy, either PVB (cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, vinblastine 12 mg/m2 day 1, bleomycin 15 U/m2 twice per week) or VPV (vinblastine 8 mg/m2 day 1, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, VP-16 50 mg/m2 days 2 to 5). Chemotherapy was given every 3 weeks. Cytoreductive surgery was done postinduction if a chemotherapy CR was not achieved. There was no difference in the percentage of patients achieving a disease-free status between PVB (77%) and VPV (73%). The mean leukocyte nadir was similar for both treatments, but the mean platelet nadir was significantly lower (P = .003) in the VPV arm. All bleomycin-related toxicities (pulmonary, mucositis, skin) were avoided in the VPV arm. We conclude that bleomycin can be replaced in first-line therapy for advanced germ cell tumors without sacrificing efficacy and with the advantage of avoiding unnecessary drug toxicity.",482,0
"Breast cancer: the military's experience at Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center. We reviewed the experience with breast cancer at Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center for the years 1978 through 1988. A total of 868 cases were identified in the Wilford Hall Tumor Registry; overall 5-year and 10-year survivals were 63% and 39%, respectively. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma represented the principal histologic category. The other predominant variants included invasive lobular carcinoma, lobular carcinoma in situ, and ductal carcinoma in situ. Until recently, most of these patients (90%) had modified radical mastectomy as their definitive surgical therapy, with chemotherapy reserved primarily for patients with advanced disease.",158,1

"Gastric lymphoma causing granulocytopenia and cold intolerance, with recovery after treatment. A 34-year-old man was found to have granulocytopenia with a white blood count of 2.3 x 10(9) l-1, consisting of 10% segmented neutrophils, 50% monocytes and 40% lymphocytes. A bone marrow aspirate showed 20% promyelocytes and 10% blasts with monoblastic features, and a smouldering myelomonocytic leukaemia was considered to be a possible diagnosis. In cold weather the patient experienced cold intolerance with acrocyanosis and small ulcerations on the ears. The test for heparin-precipitable protein ('cryofibrinogen') was strongly positive. During the following year, these signs and symptoms persisted, and the patient also developed constant moderate pain in the epigastric region. Gastroscopy revealed a large lymphoma of the stomach, which was a high-grade malignant centroblastic type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After successful removal of the tumour, and six courses of potent cytostatic combinations, the patient recovered completely, and the granulocytopenia and cold intolerance disappeared.",247,1
"Risk factors for cancer of the tongue in Uruguay. From 1987 to 1989, a hospital-based case-control study of cancer of the tongue was conducted in Montevideo, Uruguay, as part of a large study to investigate a number of risk factors for cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. The study involved interviews with 57 cases and 353 controls and was restricted to men. Relative risks (RR) associated with tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and selected dietary items were obtained by unconditional logistic-regression analysis. Users of black tobacco had a RR fourfold higher than users of blond tobacco, and heavy drinkers of alcohol had a RR of 11.6. Infrequent consumption of vegetables was associated with a significant RR of 5.3, and heavy drinkers of the local infusion ""mate"" had a RR of 2.5. It was concluded that black tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking were the strongest risk factors for cancer of the tongue in Uruguay. Their effects combine according to a multiplicative model. Also, infrequent vegetable intake and mate ingestion contribute to the risk of cancer of the tongue.",233,1
"Histopathologic study of otitis media in individuals with head and neck tumors. Five temporal bones, each including the eustachian tube, were obtained from five adults with advanced malignant tumors of the head and neck. The specimens were from the side on which the tumor had occurred. Otitis media had been detected clinically in two cases, and was detected histopathologically in the other three. We discuss the possibility that otitis media might have been caused by tumor invasion of the paratubal area, by postoperative inflammation in the nasopharynx, or by an inflammatory reaction of tubal structures to radiotherapy, or that these conditions may have coexisted.

"Glucagon: prehospital therapy for hypoglycemia. STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy of glucagon for prehospital therapy of hypoglycemia in patients without IV access. DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial. SETTING: Prehospital in a busy, urban emergency medical services system. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive patients presenting with documented hypoglycemia (ChemStrip BG less than or equal to 80 mg/dL) and symptoms of decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or seizure were enrolled. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Data collected included pretreatment (ChemStrip BG) and post-treatment serum glucose (hospital assay) as well as assessment of level of consciousness by a quantitative measure, the Glasgow Coma Score, and by a qualitative scale (0 to 3). The mean pretreatment blood glucose of 33.2 +/- 23.3 mg/dL increased after treatment to 133.3 +/- 57.3 mg/dL. Qualitative level of consciousness increased from a mean of 1.26 +/- .96 to 2.42 +/- .94 and Glasgow Coma Score increased from a mean of 9.0 +/- 4.19 to 13.04 +/- 3.68. The mean time until response was 8.8 minutes in those who responded to both level of consciousness criteria 82% (41 of 50). Glucagon administered for hypoglycemia resulted in a glucose increase in 98% (49 of 50) with headache as the only side effect noted in 4% (two of 50) of patients (P less than .0001). CONCLUSION: Glucagon is safe and effective therapy for hypoglycemia in the prehospital setting.",360,0

"Adult phosphorylase b kinase deficiency. Phosphorylase b kinase deficiency affecting muscle has been observed infrequently in children with weakness and hepatomegaly, and in 2 adults with cramps on exertion. We observed 2 additional adults with phosphorylase b kinase deficiency: Patient 1, aged 58, had progressive, predominantly distal weakness since age 46 but no cramps on exertion; Patient 2, aged 26, had cramps on exertion since age 6 but no weakness. Lactate production on ischemic exercise was impaired only in Patient 1. The serum creatine kinase level was elevated in both. Muscle specimens showed focal glycogen excess in both, and a necrotizing myopathy and mild denervation atrophy in Patient 1. Muscle phosphorylase b kinase activity was 0.5% and 8.9% of the lowest control value in Patients 1 and 2, respectively; erythrocyte phosphorylase b kinase activity was normal in both; liver phosphorylase b kinase activity, measured in Patient 1, was also normal. Other glycolytic enzymes in muscle were preserved in both.",222,0
"Familial occurrence of gastric cancer in the 2-year experience of a population-based registry. The authors studied the familial occurrence of tumors in 154 individuals with gastric cancer by reviewing the clinical data and the genealogical tree of all patients registered in 1986 through 1987 in the Local Health Care District of Modena, Italy, for cancer of the stomach. Crude and age-adjusted (world population) incidence rates of gastric cancer were 34.0 and 21.4 new cases/100,000/year, respectively, in men, and 24.5 and 10.9 in women, respectively. Among first-degree relatives of the registered patients there were 30 cases of gastric carcinoma versus 15 cases in a control group matched for age and sex (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio [M-H OR] 3.14, P less than 0.01). This excess of gastric neoplasms was observed in siblings (17 versus 7, M-H OR 4.33, P less than 0.02) but not in parents (13 versus 8, not significant). Besides gastric cancer, there was no significant excess of other type of tumors in case families. The familial occurrence of gastric cancer tended to be more frequent in patients with ""diffuse"" carcinoma (52%) than in subjects with ""intestinal"" cancer (33%), although the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the current investigation suggests that a ""family history"" for gastric neoplasms is usually observed in approximately 10% to 15% of the registered cases. As already described for other common malignancies, therefore, the familial occurrence of gastric carcinoma suggests the existence of a genetic susceptibility to cancer of the stomach, at least in a fraction of these patients.",389,1

"Diltiazem therapy for symptoms associated with nutcracker esophagus. A randomized double-blind, cross-over prospective trial in 22 patients was designed to evaluate possible effect of an oral calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, on symptoms of chest pain and/or dysphagia in patients with nutcracker esophagus. We studied 22 consecutive patients referred to an esophageal diagnostic center for evaluation of noncardiac chest pain or dysphagia having high amplitude esophageal contractions, 14 of whom completed the study. Diltiazem (60-90 mg qid) was compared with placebo, each being administered for 8 wk. Patients were evaluated with esophageal motility pre- and posttreatment periods and with regular symptom assessment throughout each 8-wk treatment. Active diltiazem therapy resulted in significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean distal esophageal peristaltic pressure (128 +/- 20 mm Hg; +/- SE) than placebo (158 +/- 16 mm Hg). Mean chest pains scores were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower with diltiazem therapy than with placebo. Only nine of the 14 patients fulfilled presently acceptable criteria for diagnosing nutcracker esophagus, and the diltiazem effect was similar, although not significant, because of the smaller sample. Conclusions: In this preliminary study involving 14 patients, the oral calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, appeared to improve noncardiac chest pain associated with strong esophageal contraction, the nutcracker esophagus. These improved symptoms were associated with significant decreases in contraction pressure.",331,0
"Radiation therapy for intraductal carcinoma. Is it an equal alternative? Of 213 consecutive patients with intraductal carcinoma, 109 were selectively treated with mastectomy and 104 with radiation therapy. There were eight local recurrences, seven in patients treated with radiation therapy and one in a patient treated with mastectomy. Histologically, there were 110 comedocarcinomas and 103 noncomedocarcinomas. Seven local recurrences occurred in patients with comedocarcinomas and one in a patient with a noncomedo tumor. Three (38%) of eight local recurrences (all comedo) were invasive. The 5-year actuarial survival for all subgroups was 100%. The median follow-up was 51 months. Intraductal carcinoma is unlikely to metastasize to axillary lymph nodes, and routine dissection is unnecessary. Ductal carcinoma in situ of the comedo variety is more aggressive and more likely to recur than its noncomedo counterpart. We currently view conservative therapy for patients with intraductal comedocarcinoma with caution.",233,1
"The elusive colonic malignancy. A need for definitive preoperative localization. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the standard of practice for the diagnosis of colonic malignancies. Unfortunately, the inability of endoscopy to obtain precise distance measurements from the anal verge can make localization of lesions at operation difficult. For this reason, preoperative barium enema or intraoperative colonoscopy have been advocated to further pinpoint the sites of those lesions not thought to be easily located at operation. Five patients are presented in whom malignant lesions of the colon were diagnosed and verified histologically, but were later undetectable at operation or subsequent colonoscopic examinations. Four of these patients underwent laparotomy and three received colon resections. None of these patients' tumors were identified during intraoperative colonoscopy, in the resected bowel on pathologic examination, or on follow-up colonoscopy. A fifth patient is presented who spontaneously passed a polyp containing invasive adenocarcinoma, but multiple colonoscopic examinations have failed to identify the site of the lesion. To date, none of these tumors have recurred with periods of follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years. These patients demonstrate a poorly documented and little understood aspect of the behavior of colonic malignancies, i.e., the ability to spontaneously regress or slough from the bowel wall. Based on these instances, localization of potentially malignant colon lesions is recommended with submucosal dye injections at initial endoscopy or with colonoscopy in the operating room immediately prior to operation.",294,1

"Localization of basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA in melanocytic lesions by in situ hybridization. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a mitogen for normal human melanocytes and keratinocytes in culture. Experiments in vitro suggest that keratinocytes supply bFGF to melanocytes through a paracrine mechanism and that the aberrant expression of bFGF in melanomas confers growth independence from bFGF-producing cells. To determine whether bFGF is expressed in vivo, we examined a series of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions in situ using bFGF riboprobes on tissue sections, and correlated bFGF expression with histologic phenotype. Seventeen melanocytic neoplasms were studied, including four common acquired nevi, four dysplastic nevi, four primary malignant melanomas, and five metastatic melanomas. Nevic cells in benign intradermal nevi showed low signal intensity (1+), whereas compound and dysplastic nevi showed 2+ to 3+ expression in the junctional nevic cell population and 1+ expression in the dermal nevic cell population. Melanocytes in primary melanomas had intermediate (2+) and those in metastatic melanomas had low (1+) levels of bFGF gene transcripts. Fibroblasts expressed high levels (3+) and epidermal and adnexal keratinocytes moderate (2+) levels of bFGF in all cases studied. Basic FGF expression in endothelial cells, known to produce and respond to this growth factor in vitro, was lower than that in the fibroblast and keratinocyte cell population and, in 10 of 17 cases, no bFGF mRNA was detectable. This study shows that bFGF is expressed in nevomelanocytes in vivo in all melanocytic lesions studied and thus cannot be used as a marker for transformation. The presence of bFGF gene transcripts in the various dermal cell types and in keratinocytes suggests that it may act as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor in regulating cellular proliferation in the skin.",404,1

"Pancreaticopleural fistula. Report of 7 patients and review of the literature. Pancreaticopleural fistula is an uncommon clinical condition. Its presentation is often confusing because of the paucity of clues suggestive of pancreatic disease and the preponderance of pulmonary symptoms and signs. Most patients are alcoholics but only one-half will have a clinical history of previous pancreatitis. Pleural effusions are large, recurrent, and highly exudative in nature. Many patients go through extensive pulmonary evaluation before the pancreas is identified as the site of primary pathology. An elevated serum amylase may be the first clue to the diagnosis. However, the key to the diagnosis is a dramatically elevated pleural fluid amylase. Effusions in association with acute pancreatitis, esophageal perforation, and thoracic malignancy are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of an elevated pleural fluid amylase but are usually easy to exclude. Computed tomography is excellent in defining pancreatic abnormalities and should be the first abdominal imaging study in suspected cases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is used as a diagnostic tool only in confusing cases. Although no systematic study evaluates medical versus surgical therapy, we recommend an initial 2 to 4-week trial of medical therapy, including allowance of no oral intake, total parenteral nutrition, chest tube thoracostomy, and possibly a regimen of somatostatin or its analogs. The major complication in these patients is superinfection, which results in significant morbidity and mortality. Failure of medical therapy should be considered failure of pleural effusion(s) to clear, recurrence after reinstatement of oral intake, or superinfection. For those patients who fail to benefit from medical therapy, surgery is indicated.",336,0
"Ethanol causes accelerated G1 arrest in differentiating HL-60 cells. The effects of clinically relevant ethanol concentrations on myeloid differentiation in the HL-60 cell promyelocytic leukemia line have been studied. The exposure of noninduced stem cells to 60 mM ethanol results in an increase in G1 cells, but there is no increase in superoxide production or expression of the Mo1 antigen. When HL-60 cells are induced to differentiate along the myeloid line with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA), there is a shift to smaller cell size, an increase in G1 cells and acquisition of the ability to produce superoxide as reported previously by several authors. When ethanol is present during differentiation, there are further increases in G1 cells, and increases in the percentage of cells which produce superoxide and express Mo1, and decreases in mean cell size and total growth during the incubation period. Regrowth experiments after periods of differentiation indicate that the increased G1 arrest seen in the presence of ethanol represents terminal commitment if inducer is present, but in the absence of inducer the increased G1 percentage is readily reversible. Examination of RNA content by flow cytometry reveals a decrease in both the peak and mean G1 RNA content during DMSO or RA induced differentiation. These decreases are accentuated by the presence of ethanol, resulting in a higher G1A/G1B ratio than in nonexposed cells. These findings indicate that ethanol enhances G1 growth arrest in HL-60 cells exposed to myeloid inducers. Partial differentiation occurs during this process, resulting in terminally arrested cells, some of which have undergone fewer postinduction cell divisions than normal and may not be fully competent.",345,1
"Squamous cell carcinoma-antigen for detection of squamous cell and mucoepidermoid carcinoma after primary treatment: a preliminary report. This study evaluated the efficacy of using the periodic measurement of the serum level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-antigen) for determining the local recurrence and/or metastasis of squamous cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas after primary treatment. It was found that at the time of clinical recognition of recurrence, the SCC-antigen level was normal, but metastasis to regional lymph nodes or to remote organs generally was accompanied by an increase of SCC-antigen. Changes in the SCC-antigen level with mucoepidermoid carcinoma seemed to be less sensitive than with squamous cell carcinoma. ",145,1
"Vaccination against tumor cells expressing breast cancer epithelial tumor antigen. Ninety-one percent of breast tumors aberrantly express an epithelial tumor antigen (ETA) identified by monoclonal antibody H23. Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing tumor antigens have considerable promise in the active immunotherapy of cancer, and we have evaluated the potential of vaccinia recombinants expressing the secreted (S) and cell-associated (transmembrane, T) forms of H23 ETA to elicit immunity to tumor cells expressing ETA. Tumorigenic ras-transformed Fischer rat fibroblast lines FR-S and FR-T, expressing the S or T form of H23 ETA, respectively, were constructed for use in challenge experiments. Expression of H23 ETA in these lines was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. When challenged by subcutaneous seeding of tumor cells, 97% (FR-S) and 91% (FR-T) of syngeneic Fischer rats rapidly developed tumors that failed to regress. Vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing ETA-T prior to challenge prevented tumor development in 82% of animals seeded with FR-T cells but in only 61% of animals seeded with FR-S. The vaccinia recombinant expressing the S form was a less effective immunogen, and vaccination protected only 29-30% of animals from developing tumors upon challenge with either FR-S or -T cells. The increased immunogenicity of the recombinant expressing ETA-T was reflected in elevated levels of ETA-reactive antibody in vaccinated animals, confirming that secreted antigens expressed from vaccinia virus are less effective immunogens than their membrane-associated counterparts.",333,1
"Cisplatin-fluorouracil interaction in a squamous cell carcinoma xenograft. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are treated with cisplatin and fluorouracil according to a schedule based on the findings of clinical studies. A similar schedule showed a supra-additive effect in the treatment of xenografted human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We sought to ascertain whether this schedule was optimal. A single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) was combined with three injections of fluorouracil given during a 24-hour period (total dose, 150 or 80 mg/kg) before, during, or after cisplatin administration. The combined effect of cisplatin and fluorouracil on tumor growth and toxic effects was schedule dependent. Consideration of both toxic effects and tumor growth inhibition, as assessed by reduction of the area under the growth curve, the optimal administration interval was found to be fluorouracil given 3 days after cisplatin administration.",205,1
"Endoscopic ultrasonography for the evaluation of smooth muscle tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract: an experience with 42 cases. Before surgery, 12 patients with suspected leiomyoma and 12 patients with suspected leiomyosarcoma were studied by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), endoscopy, and barium swallow. The results were correlated with surgery and histology. Ten leiomyomas, one benign gastric ulcer, one carcinoid metastasis, eight leiomyosarcomas, two leiomyoblastomas, one mucus secreting adenocarcinoma, and one bronchial carcinoma were diagnosed. Eighteen additional patients suspected to have benign submucosal lesions by endoscopy and barium meal were treated non-surgically, and studied by EUS and CT. EUS was superior to other imaging techniques in the detection, staging, and follow-up of submucosal smooth muscle tumors because of clear imaging of the intramural abnormality and adjacent lymph nodes.",200,1
"Regulation of pancreastatin release from a human pancreatic carcinoid cell line in vitro. The objective of these experiments was to investigate the influence of activation of three second messenger systems (protein kinase-C, adenylate cyclase-cAMP, and calcium mobilization) on the secretion of pancreastatin (PST) and chromogranin-A (CGA) by a human pancreatic carcinoid cell line (BON) in tissue culture. Stimulation of protein kinase-C by a phorbol ester (0.025-7.5 microM) caused a significant dose-related release of PST (186 +/- 22-4271 +/- 228% over controls). Treatment of BON cells with graded doses of 8-bromo-cAMP (0.14-3.0 mM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; 0.01-1.0 mM) also stimulated a dose-related release of PST (107 +/- 22-284 +/- 28 and 16 +/- 12-1076 +/- 100% over controls, respectively). Incubation of BON cells with ionomycin (0.134-13.4 microM) increased the release of PST (102 +/- 15-554 +/- 21% over controls) in a dose-related manner. A combination of IBMX and ionomycin resulted in an additive effect, whereas treatment with a phorbol ester plus IBMX resulted in a synergistic effect on PST release. Pretreatment of BON cells with monensin, an agent that prevents processing of precursors to smaller peptides, significantly decreased PST, but not CGA, secretion in response to phorbol ester or ionomycin. These findings indicate that protein kinase-C, cAMP, and Ca2+ mobilization participate in CGA and PST secretion. Although the observation that secretions of PST and CGA in response to theophylline are quantitatively associated, the absence of a quantitative relationship in the release patterns of PST and CGA in response to phorbol ester and ionomycin do not support a simple precursor-product relationship between CGA and PST. The monensin experiments are consistent with the notion that PST is derived from CGA in BON cells.",475,1
"Acute myocardial infarction resulting from the migration of a Greenfield filter. A paraplegic patient who underwent the placement of Greenfield filters to prevent pulmonary emboli had one of the filters migrate proximally to the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium, then into the right atrium a few months later. This resulted in an acute myocardial infarction by apparently causing an intimal dissection of the posterior descending artery. Treatment, follow-up and causes of filter migration are discussed.

"Developmental dysmnesia in a poor reader. A 22-yr-old subject with moderate developmental dyslexia experienced poor memory from an early age. In spite of normal intelligence he had great difficulty in learning historical and geographical names, mathematical formulae, poems and songs, and verbal series such as the letters of the alphabet and the months of the year. His recognition of familiar faces was also faulty at times. A battery of memory tests confirmed a moderate deficit of verbal as well as visual memory, whereas spatial memory was preserved. Other cognitive functions were intact, except for a mild reading disability. No evidence of brain pathology was provided by his history, neurological examination and CT scanning.",136,0
"Simultaneous or staged bilateral total knee replacements in rheumatoid arthritis. A prospective study. In a prospective study of 100 knee arthroplasties in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, simultaneous bilateral surgery was compared with staged bilateral replacements. All patients had improved function following their operations but those who had staged surgery only achieved maximum benefit after the second knee had been replaced. The complication rate was no greater for simultaneous surgery and we therefore advocate the method for those patients who require bilateral replacements.",96,0
"Radiographic manifestations of anomalies of the brain. Congenital brain anomalies are classified as developmental anomalies, effects of teratogens, errors of histogenesis, or sequelae of infections. The imaging options for delineation of these anomalies are many; a basic understanding of the disorder is central to the effective choice of imaging modality. This review begins with a brief overview of embryogenesis then reviews the common congenital brain anomalies encountered in infants. ",87,1
"Clinicopathological experience with pineocytomas: report of five surgically treated cases. The clinicopathological experience associated with five cases of pineocytoma is presented. All patients were treated by surgical removal without postoperative radiotherapy. In three individuals, 2000 cGy was administered to the tumor as a presurgical diagnostic test, with no evidence of response. All cases demonstrated histological features of pineocytoma, according to the criteria of Borit et al., and of the so-called ""pineocytoma with neuronal differentiation,"" according to the criteria of Rubinstein. The experience obtained from the present series reveals that these tumors can occur in the initial decades of life, that a cystic appearance and the presence of calcifications are distinctive features of their radiological evaluation, and that they have a good prognosis after surgical removal, even when the histological data indicate local invasion. The convenience of reserving the term ""pineocytoma"" for these tumors, and of including the so-called ""pineocytomas without further differentiation"" within the group of pineoblastomas, is suggested in order to achieve a practical clinicopathological assessment of parenchymatous pineal tumors.",228,1

"Tumor-secreted vascular permeability factor increases cytosolic Ca2+ and von Willebrand factor release in human endothelial cells. Vascular permeability factor (VPF), a tumor-secreted heparin-binding protein (Mr approximately 38,000), is responsible for increased vessel permeability and fluid accumulation associated with tumor growth. Vascular permeability factor also promotes the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) and bovine pulmonary ECs in vitro. It is shown for the first time that guinea pig VPF (half-maximal and maximal dose approximately 0.4 and 22 pmol/l (picomolar), respectively), as well as human VPF, are potent stimuli for human ECs resulting in [Ca2+]i increases (maximal three- to fourfold) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) formation. Unlike the maximal responses to thrombin and histamine, the [Ca2+]i response to a maximal VPF dose was preceded by a characteristic 10- to 15-second delay. Guinea pig VPF also selectively increased [Ca2+]i in cultured aortic and pulmonary artery ECs, but not aortic smooth muscle cells, human fibroblasts, or neutrophils. Affinity-purified rabbit antibody (raised to a synthetic peptide representing VPF N-terminal amino acids 1 to 24) adsorbed all vessel permeability-increasing activity, EC growth-promoting activity, and specifically all activity responsible for increasing EC [Ca2+]i. Similar to other mediators that increase [Ca2+]i in cultured ECs, VPF also induced a 200% increase in von Willebrand factor release. Together these data indicate that VPF acts directly on ECs and that rapid cellular events in its in vivo/in vitro actions are likely to involve phospholipase C activation, [Ca2+]i increase, and von Willebrand factor release.",382,1
"Pseudocyst of the auricle: successful treatment with intracartilaginous trichloroacetic acid and button bolsters. Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that typically involves the anthelix of the ear and results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity. We report a patient with a recurrent pseudocyst of the auricle and describe a new surgical technique for treating this condition by applying 50% trichloroacetic acid to the intracartilaginous cavity and utilizing external button bolsters for compressive therapy. This therapeutic approach is simple to perform in the office, results in permanent resolution of the pseudocyst, preserves the normal architecture of the external ear, and provides excellent postoperative and long-term cosmetic results.",158,1
"Hemopump ventricular support for patients undergoing high risk coronary angioplasty. Prophylactic implantation of a Hemopump (Johnson and Johnson, Skillman, NJ) has been evaluated in nine patients selected for high risk coronary angioplasty. They were unstable patients, refractory to maximal pharmacology, with indications for revascularization, but contraindications for surgery such as low ejection fraction and lack of material for bypass. In all, the target lesion was located on the last patent vessel. The pump was inserted under local anesthesia, without any graft. A specially designed occluder permitted avoidance of retrograde bleeding during implantation. The bypass flow ranged from 2.5 to 3.2 L/min, and permitted a rise in cardiac index from 2.05 to 2.55 L/min/m2, with a drop in capillary wedge pressure from 13 (7-18) to 10 (7-13) mmHg. During balloon inflation, no electrocardiographic changes were observed, because only minor ventricular arrhythmias occurred. No significant hemolysis was seen (plasma free hemoglobin less than 10 mg/dl in all) after 2 hr of pumping. The only limitation of the technique appears to be difficulty at the time of implantation from narrow, stenosed, or tortuous iliofemoral arteries (3 patients). This experience strongly supports the benefit of temporary left ventricular Hemopump support in high-risk situations and clearly shows the need for a smaller pump.",306,0
"Radiographic microcalcification and parenchymal patterns as indicators of histologic ""high-risk"" benign breast disease. Breast tissue from a forensic autopsy series of 486 women (15 to 98 years of age) was studied radiographically and by histologic sampling. Prevalence of Wolfe P2/Dy parenchymal patterns decreased with age. Radiographic nonvascular microcalcification and histologic presence of marked ductal epithelial hyperplasia and lobular microcalcification increased with age. Both of these histologic parameters of increased risk for breast cancer correlated with the presence of radiographic microcalcification and Wolfe P2/Dy parenchymal pattern. The predictive value of the radiographic parameters for presence of ""high-risk"" proliferative fibrocystic change increased with age.",158,1
"Magnetic resonance imaging of facial nerve neuromas. Facial nerve neuromas are uncommon tumors often confused with other tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle. Radiologically, it may be impossible to differentiate an intracanalicular facial nerve neuroma from an acoustic neuroma. We present three case reports of facial nerve neuromas arising within the internal auditory canal to show the important magnetic resonance imaging features of these tumors. One tumor extended into the cerebellopontine angle, middle cranial fossa, and middle ear. Another filled the internal auditory canal and extended through the cerebellopontine angle to the brain stem. The third occurred in a patient who had neurofibromatosis as well as numerous other intracranial tumors. We feel that gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging provides the most useful information in the preoperative assessment of this disorder. ",171,1

"Complications in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: relationships with patient age. Five hundred consecutive attempted lower limb angioplasties for ischaemic disease (370 patients, mean age 65.6 years, range 33-91 years) were reviewed. Significant complications occurred in 44 cases (8.8%). Nine patients (1.8%) underwent emergency surgery related to a complication. A further 12 patients (2.4%) underwent elective surgery related to a complication. In addition, four patients died within 30 days of the procedure; one following surgery performed because of a complication of angioplasty, one following a myocardial infarction, one following severe bleeding associated with subsequent thrombolytic therapy and one during emergency surgery related to a complication of angioplasty. A correlation was found between complication rate and age. This relationship was independent of the approach to, the position of, and the severity of the treated lesion. Elderly patients are at increased risk of complication in lower limb angioplasty.",209,0
"Scanning acoustic microscopy of neoplastic and inflammatory cutaneous tissue specimens. Acoustic microscopy utilizes high frequency ultrasound to generate microscopic images. The current study was designed to examine representative disorders of the skin by use of a reflective scanning acoustic microscope (R-SAM), and to determine whether the obtainable resolution was sufficient to render a microscopic diagnosis. An Olympus UH3 Scanning Acoustic Microscope was utilized with lenses producing burst wave frequencies at 600 and 800 MHz (600 and 800 million cylces/sec). Cutaneous tissue specimens representing 12 different neoplastic and inflammatory disorders were examined. Acoustic images of unstained sections were compared with conventional light microscopic study of sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In most neoplasms examined, it was possible to make a specific diagnosis primarily from low magnification pattern analysis. Although individual cells could be visualized, cytologic atypia was poorly defined. In the inflammatory disorders, a specific diagnosis was possible in all but bullous pemphigoid and lichen planus, because the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate was difficult to determine. The advantages of the R-SAM include the capability of producing an acoustic profile of the tissue and the future possibility of in situ diagnosis.",246,1
"Molteno implants and operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxicity. A clinicopathologic report. The right eye of a 75-year-old man with a history of cataract extraction, three penetrating keratoplasties, laser trabeculoplasty, two Molteno implants, and an operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxic lesion was studied post mortem. Histopathologic examination of the anterior segment showed evidence of penetrating keratoplasty, cataract surgery, and two Molteno implants with minimal associated tissue response. Ultrastructural examination showed a loose collagenous matrix surrounding the Molteno reservoirs, suggesting aqueous percolation from the reservoirs into the conjunctiva. Posteriorly, in the area of the phototoxic operating microscope-induced lesion, a nodule of retinal pigment epithelial hyperplasia with overlying atrophy of the photoreceptor cell layer of the neurosensory retina was noted. The retina also contained cystoid macular edema and an extensive preretinal membrane that was clinically unexpected.",193,1
"Hilar malignancy: treatment with an expandable metallic transhepatic biliary stent. An expandable metallic transhepatic biliary endoprosthesis was used to treat 20 patients with hilar malignancy and isolated right and left intrahepatic ducts. In 12 patients, only one intrahepatic ductal system was drained; in eight patients, both systems were drained. In five patients, both systems were drained through a single transhepatic track by arrangement of two stents in a T configuration. The initial technical success rate in placing the stents and achieving internal drainage was 100%. Complications necessitating further intervention occurred in two of the 20 patients. Short-term clinical follow-up was available for 19 of the 20 patients. Two months after stent insertion, two patients complained of persistent jaundice, two patients died without jaundice, and 15 patients were free of symptoms of biliary obstruction. A variety of geometric configurations are possible with this endoprosthesis. The relative merits of these stent arrangements are discussed, and a new technique for placing the stents in a T configuration is described.",227,0
"Bronchoalveolar carcinoma: factors affecting survival. One hundred thirty-four consecutive patients (65 men and 69 women) underwent pulmonary resection for bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Mean age was 65 years. Lobectomy was done in 100 patients, pneumonectomy in 10, segmentectomy in 5, and wedge excision in 19. Only 10 patients had lymph node metastases (7.5%). The neoplasm was solitary in 111 patients (82.8%); 97 were in stage I, 4 were in stage II, 9 were in stage IIIa, and 1 was in stage IIIb. There were two operative deaths (1.5%). Thirty-nine complications occurred in 31 patients. Median follow-up was 5.1 years. Recurrent bronchoalveolar carcinoma developed in 45 patients. Five- and 10-year survival for patients in stage I was 75.2% and 62.0%, respectively. Survival for patients with T1 N0 M0 neoplasms was identical to expected survival and was 90.5% at 5 years, as compared with 55.4% for patients with T2 N0 M0 disease, only 35.9% for patients with multiple bilateral disease, and 0.0% for patients with bilateral disease (p less than 0.0001). Other significant factors adversely affecting survival included the presence of signs and symptoms, diffuse malignant invasion, mucin-producing tumors, and the histological absence of scar. We conclude that bronchoalveolar carcinoma has a unique natural history that is more influenced by local neoplastic processes than by lymph node metastases. Early aggressive pulmonary resection is safe and offers the potential for cure. The presence of bilateral cancer, however, is ominous.",388,1
"Lymphocele: the spectrum of scintigraphic findings in lymphoceles associated with renal transplant. Lymphocele is a well recognized complication of renal transplant surgery. We performed a retrospective review of 305 renal transplant patients with over 2,500 scintigraphic exams to describe the pattern of activity on technetium-99m-DTPA blood flow and dynamic imaging, and iodine-131-OIH studies. Diagnostic criteria for a lymphocele were ultrasonic evidence of a perirenal fluid collection and analysis of that fluid that demonstrated BUN, creatinine, and electrolytes similar to the patient's plasma. Scintigraphic findings were attributed to a lymphocele if abnormalities were in the same area as the ultrasound fluid collection. Scintigraphic findings attributable to lymphocele resolved in all patients following surgical drainage or peritoneal window placement. Six of the 11 documented lymphoceles demonstrated a cold defect on initial dynamic images that ""filled in"" to equal background activity and another exceeded background. Three cases showed a rim of increased activity surrounding the lymphocele (""rim sign"").",218,1

"The sequelae of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in school-age children. BACKGROUND. Previous data on the consequences of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis for school-age children have been inconsistent, and much of the information on risk factors has been inconclusive. The present study was designed to evaluate the sequelae of this disease with a protocol for the comprehensive assessment of neuropsychological function. METHODS. Ninety-seven school-age children (mean age, 9.6 years), each of whom had a school-age sibling, were recruited from a survey of the medical records of 519 children treated for H. influenzae type b meningitis between 1972 and 1984 (at a mean age of 17 months) at the children's hospitals of Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. Of the 97 children, 41 had had an acute neurologic complication. Sequelae were assessed by comparing the index children with their nearest siblings on the basis of standardized measures of cognitive, academic, and behavioral status. RESULTS. Only 14 children (14 percent) had persisting neurologic sequelae: sensorineural hearing loss in 11 (unilateral in 6 and bilateral in 5), seizure disorder in 2, and hemiplegia and mental retardation in 1. Although the total sample of index children scored slightly below the siblings in reading ability, the 56 children without acute-phase neurologic complications (58 percent) were indistinguishable from their siblings on all measures. The differences between the groups were small even for the 41 pairs in which the index child had had an acute neurologic complication (mean full-scale IQ, 102 for the index children vs. 109 for the siblings). Sequelae were also associated with lower socioeconomic status and a lower ratio of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid to that in blood at the time of the meningitis. Behavioral problems were more prominent in index boys than index girls and in those who were older at the time of testing, but sex and age were not related to cognitive or academic sequelae. CONCLUSIONS. We find a favorable prognosis for the majority of children who are treated for meningitis caused by H. influenzae type b.",464,0
"Decalcification of a choroidal osteoma. A 56-year-old man presented with a clearly defined orange tumour in the posterior pole of his left eye. A choroidal osteoma was suspected, and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the nasal edge of the tumour, which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice. Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment. Three years after the patient first presented, thinning of the tumour was noted on follow-up examination. During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared, leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy. Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography.",160,1
"Tissue-specific transformation by epidermal growth factor receptor: a single point mutation within the ATP-binding pocket of the erbB product increases its intrinsic kinase activity and activates its sarcomagenic potential. Avian c-erbB is activated to a leukemia oncogene following truncation of its amino-terminal, ligand-binding domain by retroviral insertion. The insertionally activated transcripts encode protein products that have constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and that can induce erythro-leukemia but not sarcomas. We have found that a single point mutation within the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain in this truncated molecule can increase the ability of this oncogene to induce anchorage-independent growth of fibroblasts in vitro and fibrosarcoma formation in vivo. Associated with this increased transforming potential is a corresponding increase in the kinase activity of the mutant erbB protein product. The mutation, which converts a valine to isoleucine at position 157 of the insertionally activated c-erbB product, is at a residue that is highly conserved within the protein kinase family. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a point mutation in the ATP-binding pocket that activates a tyrosine kinase.",233,1
"Detection of active intraabdominal arterial hemorrhage: value of dynamic contrast-enhanced CT. Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT was used prospectively to diagnose and locate the site of active arterial intraabdominal hemorrhage in 18 patients. Active arterial extravasation was confirmed by angiography in five patients and by immediate surgery in nine. Two patients not undergoing surgery or angiography required multiple blood transfusions to correct rapidly falling hematocrit due to a coagulopathy. One patient died of hypovolemic shock, and autopsy confirmed a large acute retroperitoneal hematoma. Another patient with a splenic laceration and massive hemoperitoneum on CT had no active bleeding at the time of surgery, which was delayed 1 hr from the time of the CT. All patients were clinically thought to be hemodynamically stable and had systolic blood pressures greater than 110 mm Hg at the time of CT. In seven patients, hypotension developed either during (two patients) or immediately after (five patients) CT scanning, necessitating either immediate surgery or angiographic embolization. Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT is valuable in the diagnosis and localization of active arterial intraabdominal hemorrhage. Identification of the anatomic site of this potentially life-threatening hemorrhage is critical in determining whether immediate laparotomy or angiographic embolization is the preferred method of treatment.",261,0
Methotrexate therapy for persistent ectopic pregnancy after conservative laparoscopic management. Persistent ectopic pregnancy is a recognized complication of conservative laparoscopic surgery.

"Spinal cord compression from a thoracic paraganglioma: case report. A 34-year-old man with a 4-month history of midthoracic back pain sought treatment for a recent onset of lower extremity paresthesia and stiffness. A myelogram and computed tomographic myelogram disclosed an extradural block at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebral body with involvement of the pedicles, lamina, and spinous process. A posterior decompression of the spinal cord with subtotal resection of a highly vascular tumor was performed. The tumor was identified as a paraganglioma. In a second stage, the remainder of the tumor was embolized preoperatively, and gross total excision and sequential stabilization of the spine with a Luque rectangle and sublaminar wires were performed. The patient has been symptom free and without signs of a recurrence in the spine for over 13 months. A large abdominal paraganglioma was recently resected from its probable origin from the adventitia of the abdominal aorta.",205,0
"Heffalumps, jagulars, and cheshire cats. A commentary on cytokeratins and soft tissue sarcomas. Historically, antibodies to cytokeratin intermediate filaments have been models of target specificity.

"Autoimmune enteropathy and colitis: is there a generalised autoimmune gut disorder? Children with protracted diarrhoea, circulating enterocyte autoantibodies, and an enteropathy showing features of inappropriate HLA molecule expression on the jejunal crypt epithelium, often present with persistent blood and mucus in their stools. Eight children with autoimmune enteropathy were investigated for the presence of associated colonic disease. Six children with protracted diarrhoea, no circulating autoantibodies, and an enteropathy (in five of them) undergoing colonoscopy were used as control subjects. In all eight patients, but not in the control subjects, there was macroscopic and microscopic evidence of an accompanying colitis of variable severity, thus indicating that a more generalised intestinal disorder was present, which might affect the whole intestine. Aberrant expression of DR molecules on the colonic surface and crypt epithelium was also detected. Autoimmunity may play a role in the colitis. ",179,0
"National General Practice Study of Epilepsy: recurrence after a first seizure In the National General Practice Study of Epilepsy 564 patients classified as having definite seizures have been followed up for 2-4 years. 67% (95% confidence interval 63-71%) had a recurrence within 12 months of the first seizure, and 78% (74-81%) had a recurrence within 36 months. Seizures associated with a neurological deficit presumed present at birth had a high rate of recurrence (100% by 12 months), whereas seizures that occurred within 3 months of an acute insult to the brain, such as head injury or stroke, or in the context of an acute precipitant such as alcohol, carried a much lower risk of recurrence (40% [29-51%] by 12 months). Other factors affecting the risk of recurrence were age-the highest risk being for patients under the age of 16 (83% [77-89%] by 36 months) or over the age of 59 (83% [76-90%] by 36 months-and type of first seizure-the risk of recurrence being much higher for patients with simple partial or complex partial seizures (94% [90-99%] by 36 months) than for those with generalised tonic clonic seizures (72% [67-77%] by 36 months).",310,0
"The changing face of dermatology out-patient referrals in the south-east of Scotland. A study of out-patient dermatological services (NHS and private) in the south-east of Scotland was carried out by medical staff in the Department of Dermatology in Edinburgh during the month of November 1988. The aim was to assess changes in referral patterns and workload compared with the findings of an identical investigation undertaken in November 1981. Of particular interest were the possible effects of recent publicity campaigns aimed at increasing public awareness about skin cancer. The medical complement of the dermatology department had changed minimally since 1981 and the population increase in the south-east of Scotland over the same period was 1.5%. During November 1988 1592 new patients and 2037 review patients were seen. This represented an increase of 29.2% and 28.3%, respectively, since 1981. The most striking changes in diagnostic groups were a 173% rise in new cases presenting with benign tumours (excluding viral warts) and a 106% increase in new patients with malignant tumours. Viral warts and eczema were, as in 1981, the second and third most common diagnostic categories amongst new patients. There was a 98% increase in the number of surgical procedures performed on new patients compared with 1981. We conclude that the substantial increase in numbers of both benign and malignant tumours and the consequent doubling in surgical treatments was due to increased public awareness and concern about skin cancer.",329,1
"Boron neutron capture therapy of intracerebral rat gliosarcomas. The efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for the treatment of intracerebrally implanted rat gliosarcomas was tested. Preferential accumulation of 10B in tumors was achieved by continuous infusion of the sulfhydryl borane dimer, Na4(10)B24H22S2, at a rate of 45-50 micrograms of 10B per g of body weight per day from day 11 to day 14 after tumor initiation (day 0). This infusion schedule resulted in average blood 10B concentrations of 35 micrograms/ml in a group of 12 gliosarcoma-bearing rats and 45 micrograms/ml in a group of 10 similar gliosarcoma-bearing rats treated by BNCT. Estimated tumor 10B levels in these two groups were 26 and 34 micrograms/g, respectively. On day 14, boron-treated and non-boron-treated rats were exposed to 5.0 or 7.5 MW.min of radiation from the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor that yielded thermal neutron fluences of approximately 2.0 x 10(12) or approximately 3.0 x 10(12) n/cm2, respectively, in the tumors. Untreated rats had a median postinitiation survival time of 21 days. Reactor radiation alone increased median postinitiation survival time to 26 (5.0 MW.min) or 28 (7.5 MW.min) days. The 12 rats that received 5 MW.min of BNCT had a median postinitiation survival time of 60 days. Two of these animals survived greater than 15 months. In the 7.5 MW.min group, the median survival time is not calculable since 6 of the 10 animals remain alive greater than 10 months after BNCT. The estimated radiation doses to tumors in the two BNCT groups were 14.2 and 25.6 Gy equivalents, respectively. Similar gliosarcoma-bearing rats treated with 15.0 or 22.5 Gy of 250-kilovolt peak x-rays had median survival times of only 26 or 31 days, respectively, after tumor initiation.",516,1

The right paratracheal tumor was identified incidentally on a chest film and excised using a right thoracotomy. Although rare, vagal schwannomas should be considered for any mediastinal mass along the vagus nerves especially when the paratracheal tumor produces minimal or no respiratory symptoms suggesting a slow-growing, encapsulated process.

"Requirement of endogenous tumor necrosis factor/cachectin for recovery from experimental peritonitis. By intrasplenic immunization we raised a rat mAb (mAb V1q; IgG2a, kappa) with a potent neutralizing activity against natural mouse TNF (1 microgram/ml mAb V1q/100 U/ml TNF). mAb V1q was used to study the role of endogenous TNF in experimental peritonitis induced by sublethal cecal ligation and puncture. mAb V1q persisted for over 5 days in the serum of mice injected with 100 micrograms of the antibody and, therefore, proved useful for in vivo experiments. As little as 20 micrograms mAb V1q/mouse prevented lethal shock of the animals by 400 micrograms LPS/mouse. In sublethal cecal ligation and puncture i.p. injection of mAb V1q directly and up to 8 h after induction of experimental peritonitis lead to death of the animals within 1 to 3 days. The lethal effect of mAb V1q was compensated by injection of recombinant mouse TNF. Similar mAb V1q effects as in immunocompetent mice were shown in severe combined immune deficiency mice deficient of mature functional B and T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that during the early phase of peritonitis endogenous TNF may stimulate nonlymphoid cells such as granulocytes, macrophages, platelets, and fibroblasts to ingest bacteria and to localize inflammation, respectively. These beneficial effects of TNF may determine survival. Thus, our data may have implications for the therapeutic management of a beginning peritonitis.",331,0
"The child with recurrent syncope: autonomic function testing and beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity. Recurrent syncope in the child with a normal heart poses both diagnostic and therapeutic problems. To assess autonomic contributions to syncope, formal autonomic function testing was performed in 22 children (aged 7 to 18 years) with recurrent syncope and a normal heart. Autonomic testing consisted of eight to nine separate tests; 14 of the 22 patients had reproduction of syncope or symptoms during testing. Patients with a positive test had a lower norepinephrine level while supine (334 +/- 86 versus 547 +/- 169 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and lower norepinephrine level in the upright position (628 +/- 219 versus 891 +/- 270 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) than did patients with a negative test. The slope of heart rate response versus log isoproterenol dose was greater in patients with a positive test than in those with a negative test (1.70 +/- 0.70 versus 0.89 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.01). All five patients with a positive test who were given intravenous propranolol had elimination of syncope with repeat testing. Eight of 10 patients with a positive test were successfully treated with atenolol, including 2 patients without prior resolution of symptoms after pacemaker implantation for symptoms attributed to bradycardia. Beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity may cause recurrent syncope in young patients. Inappropriate heart rate response to standing may elicit the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, resulting in bradycardia or hypotension, or both, in some patients. Beta-adrenergic blockade is of benefit in many of these patients.",379,0
"Transcranial stab wounds: morbidity and medicolegal awareness. In this series of eight patients with transcranial stab wounds, the importance of classifications of such wounds as a separate traumatic entity is stressed. The mechanisms of neuronal and vascular damage in these wounds are discussed and are found to be specific from other head injuries. Cerebral injury by stabbing is largely restricted to the wound tract. Frontal stabs (two cases) are accompanied by the least morbidity and mortality, while temporal stabs (four cases) are more commonly fatal. In transorbital stabs (two cases) carotid-cavernous fistulae resulted. Early recognition, administration of antitetanus serum and antibiotics, and debridement may minimize complications. ",143,0
"Comparison of exercise performance in left main and three-vessel coronary artery disease. From a consecutive series of patients who underwent rest and exercise radionuclide angiography over several years, we retrospectively identified 34 patients with left main coronary artery disease and 103 patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease who did not have significant left main disease. The results of gated equilibrium radionuclide angiography were compared in these 2 groups. Multiple exercise hemodynamic, exercise electrocardiographic, and exercise radionuclide angiographic parameters were considered in an attempt to separate the 2 groups. The only parameter that was significantly different between the 2 groups was exercise heart rate. However, no value of the exercise heart rate could meaningfully separate the 2 groups. Despite their known difference in prognosis, patients with left main and three-vessel disease had very similar exercise performance and could not be distinguished from one another by exercise electrocardiography or exercise radionuclide angiography. The inability to distinguish these two groups is a clear limitation of noninvasive exercise modalities.",204,0
"Adverse impact of fibrin clot inhibitors on intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for superficial bladder tumors. Although intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy has proved to be efficacious in the treatment and prophylaxis against tumor recurrence of superficial bladder tumors, its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Previous work has suggested that bacillus Calmette-Guerin organisms attach to the matrix protein, fibronectin, during fibrin clot formation at sites of urothelial disruption and that this attachment was required for the antitumor effect of bacillus Calmette-Guerin to be expressed. Furthermore, drugs inhibiting clot formation were found to abrogate the antitumor effect of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy in a murine bladder tumor model. To examine the effect of inhibitors of fibrin clot formation on the results of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy, a retrospective analysis of 149 evaluable patients receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin for superficial bladder tumors was performed. The over-all response rate free of tumor for 29 patients who concomitantly received inhibitors of fibrin clot formation with bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy was 48%, as compared with 67% for 120 patients who were not receiving these medications (p = 0.0655, chi-square). The most striking difference was noted for patients who failed with recurrent superficial disease. Of the patients who received fibrin clot inhibitors during intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy 35% had recurrent superficial tumors compared to only 8% of those who did not receive these drugs during a mean followup of 29.8 plus or minus 11 months (p = 0.005, chi-square). Our study suggests that inhibitors of fibrin clot formation may have an adverse influence on the results of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for superficial bladder tumors.",405,1
"Heparin as the cause of coagulopathy which may complicate grafting of the liver. Disposal of heparin is accomplished rapidly by the normal liver, but the effects of ischemia, flushing and hypothermia during hepatic transplantation have not been investigated before. The results of the present study showed that neither laparotomy, hypothermia nor insertion of the portosystemic bypass seemed markedly to affect the coagulation profile, but autograft associated with 30 to 45 minutes of warm ischemia resulted in a twofold prolongation of the t1/2 heparin as calculated from sequential measurements of the activated clotting time. Unexpectedly, the storage of livers for four hours in EuroCollins solutions seemed to result in more rapid disappearance of heparin than in animals after laparotomy. After hepatectomy, the clearance of heparin was delayed for two hours but, thereafter, the slope of the disappearance resembled that in sham operated animals. Autograft and allograft of livers in normal pigs that did not receive transfusion were also associated with changes in fibrinolysis and declining levels of fibrinogen together with severe intraoperative bleeding problems and rapid death on the operating table in 30 per cent of the pigs. While administration of heparin alone did not appear to precipitate these changes, use of the drug after dissection, mobilization and storage of the liver may release other tissue factors that activate fibrinolysis.",268,0
"Clinicopathologic features of hepatocellular carcinoma in young patients. To investigate clinicopathologic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young adults, excised tumors from 21 patients younger than 45 years (young group) were compared with findings in tumors from 204 patients older than 45 (old group). In the young group HCC showed (1) a high incidence of positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (young 71.4% versus old 20.1%); (2) relatively well-preserved hepatocellular function (indocyanine green test; young 10.7 +/- 8.8% versus old 20.6 +/- 10.8%); (3) low incidence of histologically verified concomitant cirrhosis (young 52.4% versus old 78.4%); and (4) a more advanced stage of the disease in TNM classification (Stage III; young 52.4% versus old 18.1%). With respect to survival rates achieved by surgery, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Thus, hepatitis B virus may relate to the occurrence of HCC in the young patients. Despite the advanced stage in the young group, survival rate after surgery was comparable with that achieved in the old group. These observations mean that a close periodic surveillance of young adults with a positive HBsAg is required to detect HCC at an early stage. Treatment of patients with HBsAg using interferon or vidarabine and hepatitis B vaccine should be made to convert HBsAg to negative in these individuals.",331,1
"Retinal vasculitis--a primer. Retinal vasculitis is a diagnosis that is generally suggested by an ophthalmologist. Frequently patients with the disorder are referred to nonophthalmologists for further diagnostic evaluation or treatment. The criteria for defining vasculitis differ greatly between ophthalmologists and other physicians. To facilitate collaboration between ophthalmologists and their colleagues, we have sought to clarify the term ""retinal vasculitis"" by discussing its subcategories, the potential role of antiphospholipid antibodies, and the etiology of retinal vasculitis. We offer guidelines for evaluating the disorder and treating patients. ",125,0
"Lateral deviation of the eyes on forced lid closure in patients with cerebral lesions. We examined 35 patients with unilateral cerebral lesions to determine the incidence of lateral deviation of the eyes under forcefully closed lids and the reliability of this sign in predicting the side of the lesion. Only patients with radiologically confirmed unilateral lesions were studied. Over 70% of patients had contralateral ocular deviation (Cogan's ""spasticity of conjugate gaze""), 20% had ipsilateral deviation, and less than 9% of the patients had no deviation. Lateral ocular deviation was as sensitive, but not as specific, as a unilateral Babinski plantar response in determining the side with the lesion. Contralateral deviation was more common with parietotemporal localization, suggesting that the phenomenon reflects an underlying disturbance of attentional mechanisms.",165,0
"An angiographic technique for three-dimensional determination of arterial supply patterns in cadaver soft tissue. A method for arterial tree mapping that can be used in cadaver soft tissue is presented. In situ angiograms and photographs are supplemented with profile angiograms of relatively narrow bands of tissue from the removed specimen. The described method was better suited for mapping the course and supply patterns of a soft-tissue arterial network than either in situ angiograms or dissection. While practical problems were encountered with most of the solutions used for providing radiopacity or structural support to the vessels, pure barium sulfate was found to be suitable because it filled the vascular tree to the capillary level without leakage during excision of the specimen.

"Evidence for platelet-activating factor as a novel mediator in experimental stroke in rabbits. Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of inflammation, which has untoward effects on cerebrovascular and neural elements. While several investigators have reported attenuation of ischemic damage after treatment with antagonists of platelet-activating factor, no study has proved endogenous production of platelet-activating factor in ischemia of the central nervous system. We hypothesized that endogenous production of platelet-activating factor participates in the early pathologic manifestations of deteriorating stroke. In 12 rabbits, we found tissue levels of platelet-activating factor measured by the release of serotonin from washed platelets to be elevated by approximately 20-fold in spinal cord injured by 25 minutes of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion (2.80 +/- 0.98 ng/g) compared with that in normal spinal cord (0.15 +/- 0.06 ng/g, p less than 0.01). Given during ischemia to seven rabbits, 10 mg/kg i.p. of a highly selective and potent antagonist of platelet-activating factor (BN 50739) accentuated the early postischemic hyperemia and prevented the delayed hypoperfusion measured by on-line laser-Doppler flowmetry (-35 +/- 7% of baseline [n = 7] without versus 33 +/- 14% with treatment, p less than 0.01) and the edema formation measured as the increase in tissue water content (4.4 +/- 0.7% without [n = 6] versus 2.1 +/- 0.6% with [n = 7]treatment, p less than 0.05) after 2 hours of reperfusion. This neurochemical and pharmacologic evidence emphasizes a new perspective of ischemia-induced phospholipid degradation and suggests an important role for platelet-activating factor in the early manifestations of stroke.",399,0
"Human interleukin-3 mRNA accumulation is controlled at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a hematopoietic growth factor that regulates the differentiation of multilineage and committed progenitor cells and the functions of some mature blood cells. The expression of human IL-3 appears to be restricted to stimulated T lymphocytes. We have investigated the kinetics and mechanisms involved in the induction of IL-3 expression in the human T lymphocytic tumor cell line Jurkat. We show that accumulation of IL-3 mRNA is controlled at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Transcription of the IL-3 gene in these cells appears to be constitutive but no IL-3 mRNA was detected in unstimulated cells, indicating that in resting cells IL-3 mRNA is highly unstable. Treatment with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) induced a small and transient increase in the IL-3 gene transcription rate and led to the production of detectable levels of IL-3 mRNA and protein. Optimal induction of IL-3 expression required a second stimulus. Costimulation of Jurkat cells with both phorbol myristate acetate and PHA caused both a transient increase in IL-3 gene transcription, which is dependent on new protein synthesis, and also a transient increase in mRNA stability.",260,1
"Hemodialysis for acute renal failure in patients with hematologic malignancies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognosis of patients with hematologic malignancies in acute renal failure who require hemodialysis. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: ICU. PATIENTS: Forty-three consecutive patients. METHODS: Prognostic analysis using both univariate and multivariate (stepwise regression) methods. RESULTS: Fifteen (35%) patients recovered from acute renal failure and 12 (28%) were discharged from the ICU. The prognosis of patients with acute renal failure linked to sepsis is poorer than the prognosis of the patients with acute renal failure from other etiologies. Only one patient survived in the former group (n = 26) and 11 in the latter group (n = 17); p less than .0001 in multivariate analysis. When accompanied by associated respiratory failure, mortality rate was higher (93% vs. 33%; p less than .0001). The Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) calculated within the first 24 hr of admission was significantly (p less than .001) related to mortality when the SAPS was greater than or equal to 13. The presence of neutropenia and the type of hematologic malignancy were not related to a worse prognosis. Tolerance to hemodialysis appeared good, and complications were rare.",283,1
"Antigen-presenting activity of draining lymph node cells from mice painted with a contact allergen during ultraviolet carcinogenesis. The induction of skin cancers in mice by chronic UV irradiation is accompanied by a decrease in the numbers of Ia+ and Thy-1+ dendritic cells in the epidermis early in the course of UV irradiation. Subsequently, the number of Ia+ cells, but not Thy-1+ cells, increases until the time of tumor development. To assess the functional significance of these changes in cutaneous immune cells, and to help define the role these cells may play in immune surveillance against skin cancers, we tested the afferent immunologic capability of the skin during the development of UV-B radiation-induced skin cancers. Afferent immune function was measured by testing the Ag-presenting capacity of draining lymph node (DLN) cells from mice sensitized epicutaneously with dinitrofluorobenzene. A reduced contact hypersensitivity response was induced in mice immunized with DLN cells from UV-irradiated mice that had been sensitized with hapten on UV-irradiated skin. This decreased reactivity was present during the entire latent period of tumor development. However, in tumor-bearing mice, the DLN cells from UV-irradiated, sensitized animals exhibited normal Ag-presenting activity. DLN cells from UV-irradiated mice sensitized on ventral, unirradiated skin exhibited normal Ag-presenting activity. The lowest amount of Ag-presenting activity in the draining lymph nodes of UV-irradiated mice correlated temporally with the lowest number of Ia+, adenosine triphosphatase+ dendritic epidermal cells in the UV-irradiated skin. At least during the early part of the tumor latent period, an increase in the number of these cells was paralleled by an increase in the Ag-presenting activity of the DLN cells. In contrast, the number of Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells in UV-irradiated skin did not correlate with the Ag-presenting activity. Thus, the decrease in the number of identifiable epidermal Langerhans cells early in the course of chronic UV irradiation correlated with a decrease in Ag-presenting activity after sensitization through the UV-irradiated skin. These studies demonstrate that the afferent arm of the cutaneous immune response is impaired in the site of tumor development throughout the latent period of UV carcinogenesis.",471,1
"Effectiveness of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin combination chemotherapy in good-prognosis metastatic testicular nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. The combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (CEB) was evaluated as initial chemotherapy in 76 patients with good-prognosis metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) between 1984 and 1988. The classification of eligible patients included Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) stages IM, IIA, IIB, IIC, IIIA, IIIB, IV0ABCL1, and IV0ABL2. Four courses of combination chemotherapy were administered in a 21-day cycle, and surgical excision of residual mass was performed in 27 cases (23 laparotomies and four thoracotomies). At the time of analysis, median follow-up was 24 months from start of chemotherapy (range, 6 to 54 months). The 2-year cause-specific survival probability was 98.5%, the single cause-related mortality being caused by bleomycin pneumonitis. Five patients failed CEB chemotherapy, but all have been successfully salvaged with a combination of surgery and intensive chemotherapy, follow-up from completion of all treatment being 35 to 44 months. The toxicity of CEB included bone marrow suppression and alopecia in all patients but no significant neurotoxicity or ototoxicity, and minimal renal toxicity. Only four (5%) patients had a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate greater than 15%. In 51% of patients, the hemoglobin fell below 10 g/dL. The WBC count nadir was less than 1,500/microL in 11% of treatment cycles and in 16% the platelet nadir fell below 50,000/microL. Decreases in the WBC and platelet counts were of very brief duration. Only one of 310 CEB cycles was complicated by neutropenic sepsis, and there were no episodes of thrombocytopenic purpura or bleeding. We conclude that the CEB combination represents an effective alternative to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in good-prognosis NSGCT and that the replacement of cisplatin by carboplatin leads to reduced toxicity.",480,1
"Primary prevention of coronary artery disease through a family-oriented cardiac risk factor clinic. Primary prevention of coronary artery disease in children and young adults is important and can be instituted through a family-oriented cardiac risk factor clinic. Such a clinic was initiated at the Medical College of Georgia in March 1988. Children whose total cholesterol level (TC) exceeded 200 mg/dL when screened by their primary care physician were referred with their siblings and parents for fasting lipid profile and further evaluation. Data are available for the initial 21 families, including 30 children and 36 adults. The mean TC level was 258 mg/dL for index cases, 195 mg/dL for siblings, and 233 mg/dL for parents. Follow-up data obtained after therapy at a mean of 6 months are available for 12 families, including 14 children and 14 adults. The mean change in TC was from 265 to 246 mg/dL; 82% of the patients had a decrease in TC. Only one index case was documented as having neither a sibling nor a parent with an elevated cholesterol level. Family-oriented cardiac risk factor clinics are important for the identification and treatment of hypercholesterolemia in asymptomatic young people when primary prevention is possible.",276,0
"Spatial dispersion of magnetic stimulation in peripheral nerves. To assess the longitudinal dispersion of the stimulus induced by the magnetic coil, collision experiments were performed in seven normal ulnar nerves. A supramaximal electrical stimulus S1 was delivered at the wrist, and followed by a supramaximal stimulus S2 in the upper arm, which was either electrical (electrical collision studies), or magnetic (magnetic collision studies). The interstimulus interval was varied by 0.2 msec increments from the time of complete cancellation of the S2 evoked motor response onwards, to include the entire span of recovery of that compound motor action potential. Collision curves were obtained for both magnetic and electrical stimuli by plotting the amplitude of the motor response elicited by S2 as a function of the interstimulus interval. In all seven normal ulnar nerves, comparison of the collision curves showed that the S2 evoked motor response is restored significantly more slowly when magnetic stimulation is used. This finding is best explained by longitudinal dispersion of the stimulus induced by the magnetic coil relative to conventional electrical stimulation, the large fibers being stimulated further away from the coil than the small ones. This interpretation is confirmed by the findings obtained with the same method in two cases of ulnar neuropathy, and by comparison of different intensities of magnetic stimulation.",250,0
"Tenascin expression in hyperproliferative skin diseases. The expression of tenascin, a recently discovered extracellular matrix glycoprotein, was studied by immunohistochemistry in normal human skin and in a number of skin diseases with epidermal hyperproliferation such as psoriasis, basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and solar keratosis. Tenascin expression in the upper dermis of normal skin was found to vary from almost absent to patchy along the basal membrane. Staining was continuous and intense around blood vessels, hair follicles and eccrine sweat ducts. In basal cell carcinoma a marked expression of tenascin was found in the tumour stroma, especially adjacent to the basal membrane surrounding the tumour cell nests. In Bowen's disease and solar keratosis, tenascin expression was found in the dermis next to the keratinocytes. In psoriasis the dermal papillae of clinically involved skin were intensely stained and a continuous band of tenascin was present in the upper dermis along the basal membrane. The distribution of tenascin differed from other known extracellular matrix components. ",208,1
"Suggestive evidence that pelvic endometriosis is a progressive disease, whereas deeply infiltrating endometriosis is associated with pelvic pain. In a 3-year prospective study of 643 consecutive laparoscopies for infertility, pelvic pain, or infertility and pain, the pelvic area, the depth of infiltration, and the volume of endometriotic lesions were evaluated. The incidence, area, and volume of subtle lesions decreased with age, whereas for typical lesions these parameters and the depth of infiltration increased with age. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis was strongly associated with pelvic pain, women with pain having larger and deeper lesions. Because deep endometriosis has little emphasis in the revised American Fertility Society classification and after analyzing the diagnoses made in each class, considerations for a simplifying revision with inclusion of deep lesions are suggested. In conclusion, suggestive evidence is presented to support the concept that endometriosis is a progressive disorder, and it is demonstrated that deep endometriosis is strongly associated with pelvic pain.",188,1

"Ventilatory function as a predictor of fatal stroke. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the relation between ventilatory function and subsequent mortality due to cerebrovascular disease. DESIGN--Prospective longitudinal study. SUBJECTS--A total of 18,403 male civil servants aged 40-64 years at entry examination for the Whitehall study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (ICD8 430-438) after 18 years of follow up. RESULTS--In all, 262 men with sinus rhythm at entry died due to stroke during the 18 years of follow up. Compared with men with a forced expiratory volume in one second of greater than or equal to 3.5 litres those with a value of less than 3.0 litres were almost twice as likely to die of cerebrovascular disease (rate ratio adjusted for age and systolic blood pressure = 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.69). This increased risk occurred within each tertile of systolic blood pressure. Nested case-control analyses were used to control precisely for confounding effects of age, height, and smoking (by matching) and employment grade and physiological risk factors (by modelling). The effect of forced expiratory volume in one second was independent of age, height, smoking habits, employment grade, blood pressure, weight, cholesterol concentration, glucose tolerance, electrocardiographic abnormalities, history of chest pain, and history of intermittent claudication. CONCLUSIONS--Measurements of ventilatory function may assist clinical decisions about whether to treat mild hypertension. Impaired ventilatory function and stroke may share common causes.",341,0
"Survival in patients with large-bowel cancer. A population-based investigation from the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. Five-year survival data were obtained in 97 percent or 1105 of 1140 new patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma during a 12-month period in 1981 and 1982, as part of a large comprehensive population-based study of colorectal cancer incidence, etiology, and survival, The Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. Fifteen percent of patients were Dukes' A stage, 32 percent were Dukes' B, 25 percent were Dukes' C, and 29 percent were Dukes' D. At five years after diagnosis, the observed survival rate was 36 percent and the adjusted rate was 42 percent. Dukes' staging was a highly discriminating factor in survival (P less than 0.001). Survival rates were better in women than in men and better for patients with colon cancer than for patients with rectal cancer. Survival by Dukes' staging was not affected by colon subsite or by the tumor being the first and single tumor, metachronous tumor, or synchronous tumor. The survival of younger patients was better for Dukes' stages A, B, and C, and worse for Dukes' D. Survival was worse in the presence of bowel perforation in Dukes' C and D stages. Within Dukes' D (incurable cases), survival was best in the absence of hepatic metastases, slightly worse when only hepatic metastases were present, and poorest in the presence of both hepatic and extrahepatic metastases. Statistical modeling of survival determinants other than staging indicated that cell differentiation had the largest effect (survival decreasing with poor cell differentiation), followed by site (survival worse for rectal cancer than colon cancer), then age (survival better for younger patients), while bowel perforation had the smallest effect on survival.",384,1

"Long-term follow-up of patients operated on for recurrent carotid stenosis. We reviewed our experience with 29 operations for recurrent carotid stenosis in 27 patients who underwent both their primary carotid endarterectomy and their reoperations at our institution. These 27 patients represent 4% of the 667 patients who underwent primary carotid endarterectomies at our institution and who are included in our carotid follow-up registry. Reoperation was prompted by recurrent symptoms in 19/29 (65.5%) cases. Comparison of long-term stroke prevention in those patients who did (84% at 5 years, 78.6% at 10 years) and did not (90.3% at 5 years, 83.6% at 10 years) develop recurrent stenosis requiring reoperation revealed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.48) when measured from the time of primary operation. The perioperative stroke and death rates for reoperation (3.4% and 0%) were acceptable. We conclude that with our acceptably low perioperative stroke morbidity (3.4%), surgery for recurrent carotid stenosis in symptomatic patients or in asymptomatic patients with high-grade (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis maintains the durable stroke prevention offered by primary carotid endarterectomy.",280,0
"Percutaneous thecoperitoneal shunt for syringomyelia. Report of three cases. Between January and April, 1990, three consecutive cases of syringomyelia were treated by percutaneous placement of thecoperitoneal shunts. Two of these patients had undergone craniovertebral decompression earlier at other centers and the third was treated primarily by a thecoperitoneal shunt. In each case, the syrinx was associated with Chiari I malformation, although the clinical presentation was due to a myelopathy. All three patients obtained unequivocal benefit from this simple procedure. Postoperative magnetic resonance images showed considerable shrinkage of the cysts corresponding with clinical improvement.",135,0
"Gallbladder surgery following cholecystlithotripsy: suggested guidelines for treatment Twenty-three of 229 symptomatic patients undergoing cholecystlithotripsy underwent surgical intervention: 22 of the patients had cholecystectomy performed (five also undergoing choledochotomy) and one patient had a cholecystostomy. Of these 23 patients, five were lithotripsy failures, five developed acute pancreatitis, one had acute cholecystitis, and one had cholangitis. One patient had her gallbladder removed incidentally at the time of surgery for a bleeding gastric ulcer. Ten patients underwent surgery for recurrent biliary pain, probably related to fragment passage via the cystic duct. We suggest that up to 16 of these 23 patients did not necessarily require cholecystectomy, i.e. five patients with pancreatitis, one patient with cholangitis and ten patients with recurrent biliary colic. Conservative and/or endoscopic management may be successful in the first instance to allow further treatment with lithotripsy in the majority of patients. If, however, the expertise to perform endoscopic sphincterotomy is not available or the patient declines further lithotripsy, then resort to surgery may be necessary. We propose that it is the responsibility of the management team in charge of the lithotripsy unit to inform both the patient and the referring clinicians of the possible side-effects and outcome of treatment in an attempt to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures.",294,0
"Radiographic manifestations of anomalies of the lung. Congenital nonvascular anomalies of the lung can be subdivided into those affecting the bronchial tree and those affecting parenchymal abnormalities. Embryologic development of the lung is briefly reviewed to facilitate an understanding of developmental pulmonary anomalies.

"Irritable bowel syndrome in women having diagnostic laparoscopy or hysterectomy. Relation to gynecologic features and outcome. We identified irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in 47.7% of 86 women having diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain, 39.5% of 172 women having elective hysterectomy, and 32.0% of 172 controls age-matched for the hysterectomy group (P = NS). Constipation and pain subtype IBS were more common in hysterectomy patients than controls (P less than 0.05). In laparoscopy patients, dyspareunia was more common in those with IBS than in those without it (P less than 0.05). In the hysterectomy group, more IBS patients had chronic pelvic pain (P less than 0.005), and abnormal menses (P less than 0.01). Chronic pelvic pain was more frequently the only prehysterectomy diagnosis in IBS patients (P less than 0.05), and IBS was present more often when pain was a reason for hysterectomy (P less than 0.01). One year after laparoscopy, IBS patients gave lower overall status ratings (P less than 0.01) and lower pain improvement ratings (P less than 0.05) than non-IBS patients. In women who had a hysterectomy for pain, there was less pain improvement one year later in those with the pain subtype of IBS than in non-IBS patients (P less than 0.05). IBS is associated with gynecologic symptoms and affects the symptomatic outcome of diagnostic laparoscopy and hysterectomy.",345,0
"Insulin secretion and action in patients with pancreatic cancer. The authors investigated insulin secretory capacity and insulin action in 11 preoperative patients with pancreatic carcinoma and 15 age-matched and weight-matched healthy subjects (C). Five patients were classified as diabetic (D), two as impaired glucose tolerant (IGT), and four as nondiabetic (ND). Postabsorptive serum insulin levels (mean +/- SE, in uU/ml) in D (12 +/- 2), IGT (17 +/- 7), and ND (10 +/- 2) were comparable. After administration of 100 g of oral glucose, peak insulin achieved in D (60 +/- 11) was lower than in IGT (101 +/- 26) and ND (83 +/- 20), whereas peak insulin levels in IGT and ND were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than in C (45 +/- 6). Comparable insulin response to nonglucose stimuli was documented in all subjects using the slow arginine infusion test with mean serum insulin of 27 +/- 4 in D, 28 +/- 6 in IGT, 34 +/- 10 in ND, and 32 +/- 5 in C. In six patients (P) and six controls, insulin action was assessed by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, with glucose turnover rates estimated by [3-3H]glucose infusion. Steady-state plasma glucose concentrations were maintained at 92 +/- 3 (P) and 91 +/- 1 mg/dl (C). After insulin infusion at the rate of 1.0 mU/kg/min, comparable high physiologic insulin levels were observed in P (73 to 104 uU/ml) and in C (81 to 103 uU/ml). Postabsorptive rates of endogenous glucose appearance (Ra) were higher in P (2.86 to 3.02 mg/kg/min) than in C (1.50 to 2.80 mg/kg/min). At high physiologic insulin concentrations, negative Ra values were documented in all subjects, and complete suppression of Ra was assumed. Total body glucose use (M) was consistently lower in P (3.90 to 6.40 mg/kg/min) than in C (6.98 to 10.40 mg/kg/min), consistent with a state of insulin resistance. Patients with pancreatic cancer manifest insulin resistance by virtue of a decrease in total body glucose use (M) and decreased insulin response to glucose due to either inherent beta cell dysfunction or decreased islet cell mass. The latter is not identifiable by histologic morphology.",576,1
"Possible involvement of the retinoblastoma gene in undifferentiated sinonasal carcinoma. Retinoblastoma tumor formation is initiated by the loss of function of both alleles of the RB-1 gene on chromosome 13. Patients with the hereditary form of retinoblastoma carry a germ line mutation at one of the two homologous gene loci in all cells and have an increased risk for nonocular tumors (mainly osteosarcoma and other mesenchymal tumors) in later life. The authors studied a 38-year-old patient with sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) who had been treated for bilateral retinoblastoma by enucleation (left eye) and irradiation (right eye), respectively. Using molecular probes for the RB-1 gene and other loci on chromosome 13, the authors detected a deletion at the RB-1 locus in metastatic SNUC cells that was not present in normal tissue. These findings indicate that somatic mutations at RB-1 locus may be involved in the formation or progression of ectodermal tumors.",203,1
"Carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct. A review of 39 instances of excision of a cyst of the thyroglossal duct performed at St. Paul Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, revealed two patients with carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct. A review of the English literature yielded 146 instances of this uncommon tumor. Eighty-four per cent were papillary adenocarcinoma of thyroid type and 5 per cent were squamous cell carcinoma. The patients were from six to 81 years old with a 2:1 female to male ratio. Metastatic disease to lymph nodes was noted in 11 per cent and invasion of overlying strap muscles was found in 4 per cent. Carcinoma of the thyroid gland occurred in 14 per cent. Preoperative diagnosis was rare. The Sistrunk procedure is recommended for initial surgical therapy with further surgical or adjuvant therapy dependent on associated clinical findings. Prognosis for carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct of thyroid type parallels that of carcinoma of the thyroid gland.",204,1
"Factors predictive of results of direct ablative operations for drug-refractory ventricular tachycardia. Analysis of 80 patients. During a 9-year period 80 patients with drug-resistant sustained ventricular tachycardia underwent direct surgical ablation of arrhythmogenic myocardium. Sixty-nine were male (86%) and 11 female (14%), with 1.9 +/- 1.1 (standard deviation) ventricular tachycardia morphologies per patient. The mean number of drugs failed was 3.7 +/- 1.6 per patient. The preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was 36.4% +/- 14.4%. Complete preoperative endocardial mapping data (greater than 4 endocardial sites in each ventricular tachycardia) were available for 60 of the 80 patients (75%) and intraoperative endocardial data in the clinical ventricular tachycardia was obtained in 37 (46.3%) of the patients. In 17 patients mapped intraoperatively by computer-assisted techniques, complete epicardial and endocardial data in the clinical ventricular tachycardia were obtained in 14 patients (82.4%). Overall, 73 of 80 (91.3%) had some mapping data available. Hospital mortality occurred in 10 patients (12.5%) at a mean interval of 13.5 days, range 0 to 62 days. Postoperatively the clinical ventricular tachycardia has not recurred in 65 of 70 surviving patients (92.9%). Nonclinical ventricular tachycardia occurred in another four patients. All nine patients with postoperative ventricular tachycardia responded to drugs. The major factors predictive of hospital mortality were prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (greater than 150 minutes), preoperative ejection fraction less than 31%, and incomplete preoperative mapping. Hospital mortality in patients with an ejection fraction below 31% was significantly associated with a history of amiodarone usage. At 3 years of follow-up, freedom from sudden cardiac death was 95.7%, and 86.7% of patients were free of ventricular tachycardia on no antiarrhythmic drugs. These results suggest that direct ventricular tachycardia operations are an effective form of therapy for patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.",465,0
"Surgical management of 552 carcinomas of the extrahepatic bile ducts (gallbladder and periampullary tumors excluded). Results of the French Surgical Association Survey. Five hundred fifty-two cases of primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts (gallbladder and periampullary tumors excluded) collected from 55 surgical centers were reviewed retrospectively. Three hundred seven patients (56%) had upper-third lesions (proximal carcinoma), whereas 71 (13%) and 101 (18%), respectively, had middle-third and lower-third bile duct carcinomas. The remaining patients had diffuse lesions. Resectability rates were 32% for upper-third localization compared to 47% and 51% for middle-third and lower-third localization, respectively. The operative mortality rate for proximal carcinomas was significantly lower with resection (16%) compared with palliative surgery (31%) (p less than 0.05). Overall 1-year survival (operative deaths excluded) was 68% after tumor resection compared to 31% after palliative surgery (p less than 0.001). Long-term results after surgical resection correlated with local and regional extension of the disease. The results of this study show that resection of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas, particularly in an upper-third localization, often is associated with worthwhile long-term survival.",295,1
"Choroid plexus tumors in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous system. A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others). Choroid plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the syndrome. The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors. Choroid plexus neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. ",158,0
"Loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 17 and 18 in breast carcinoma: two additional regions identified. The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific regions of the human genome in tumor DNA is recognized as evidence for a tumor-suppressor gene located within the corresponding region of the homologous chromosome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a panel of primary human breast tumor DNAs has led to the identification of two additional regions on chromosomes 17q and 18q that frequently are affected by LOH. Deletions of each of these regions have a significant correlation with clinical parameters that are associated with aggressive breast carcinomas. Previous restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of this panel of tumors has uncovered several other frequently occurring mutations. LOH on chromosome 18q frequently occurs in tumors with concomitant LOH of loci on chromosomes 17p and 11p. Similarly, tumors having LOH on 17q also have LOH on chromosomes 1p and 3p. This suggests that certain combinations of mutations may collaborate in the development and malignant progression of breast carcinomas.",227,1
"Pretreatment neuropsychological status and associated factors in children with primary brain tumors. We report on the neuropsychological status of 31 children with primary brain tumors who underwent assessment before receiving therapy. Overall, the children performed within normal limits in all test areas. The exception was the group with anterior hemispheric tumors who demonstrated deficits in executive cognitive functions. Also, when compared according to tumor type, children with midline tumors and hydrocephalus performed more poorly than others on measures of intelligence, executive abilities, visual-motor skills, and fine-motor functions. Although one-half to two-thirds of the children with supratentorial midline and infratentorial tumors had cranial nerve, oculomotor, or cerebellar deficits, only the latter were associated with specific neuropsychological deficits (poorer performance on fine-motor and visual-motor tests). Age did not appear to be a factor in these children's neuropsychological test performances.",186,1
"A palmar dermatosis linked to occult carcinoma of the upper thorax, head and neck: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. An unusual, persistent, corregated-to-honeycombed thickening of the palms accompanied by tenderness around the fingernails was found to be a cutaneous marker for internal malignancy. This combination of signs and symptoms has been reported under two clinical entities: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm. This paraneoplastic syndrome is of interest to head and neck surgeons due to the location of the primary tumor, the site of metastatic disease, and the ability to cure the cutaneous disease by surgical removal of the primary tumor. In our patient, a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung not detectable on chest x-ray presented as a cervical mass accompanied by cutaneous changes on the palms and fingernails. Recognition of the relationship of the dermatologic changes to malignancy of a specific body region eventually led to the detection of the primary tumor. The characteristics of these paraneoplastic syndromes were reviewed in this report. ",206,1
"Human papillomavirus screening for women with atypical Papanicolaou smears. A study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and colposcopy in the management of women whose Papanicolaou smears demonstrated atypia less than dysplasia. Fifty patients whose initial Papanicolaou smears were interpreted as showing atypia less than dysplasia were evaluated for the presence of HPV 16 DNA in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells and for histologic findings on biopsy. Those 50 patients were compared to two groups of patients: one consisting of 124 patients with biopsy-documented cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and another of 112 patients with normal Papanicolaou smears. The presence of HPV 16 DNA was confirmed with Southern analysis in 46% of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears, 46% with confirmed CIN and 11.6% with normal Papanicolaou smears. The 50 patients with atypical smears underwent colposcopically directed cervical biopsies, revealing the following results: 14 (28%) had normal histology, 29 (58%) had koilocytosis without dysplasia, and 7 (14%) had CIN. HPV 16 DNA was present in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells from a large percentage of patients from each category (50% of patients with normal histology, 41.2% with koilocytosis and 57% with CIN). HPV 16 DNA screening did not predict which patients with atypical smears had underlying CIN. Colposcopically directed biopsy remains the evaluation method of choice.",339,1
"Effects of treatment on long-term survivors with malignant astrocytomas. We reviewed the records of 160 consecutive patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma to evaluate the long-term consequences of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We defined long-term survivors as those patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma who lived at least 100% longer than median survival of historical controls, for example, 2 years for patients with glioblastoma and 4 years for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. There were 9 (5.6%) long-term survivors. Three (30%) became demented and died without evidence of tumor recurrence. One, after survival of 10 years, died of tumor recurrence. Of the remaining survivors, 2 (22%) have significantly impaired short-term memory function and other neurological deficits such as gait apraxia. Three (30%) can function independently. It is likely but cannot be proved that it is radiotherapy and not chemotherapy that is the causal factor of this dismal therapeutic outcome. Our study suggests restraint in the use of radiotherapy for patients with brain tumors that have more favorable prognoses than glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, such as low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.",266,1
"Biphasic modulation of acetaminophen bioactivation and hepatotoxicity by pretreatment with the interferon inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Interferons and interferon induction can inhibit cytochromes P-450 and reduce the bioactivation and hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. However, since P-450 inhibition often is followed by P-450 induction, which would enhance acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, the possibility of a biphasic modulation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by interferons was investigated. Outbred male CD-1 mice of various ages, and young inbred male C57BL/6 mice were given the interferon inducer, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I-C), 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, followed 1 to 48 days later by a single dose of acetaminophen, 300 to 450 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by the peak plasma concentration of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurring between 0 and 48 hr after acetaminophen treatment. Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen given within 8 days, with maximal inhibition between 1 and 4 days. Conversely, a maximal 7-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed in CD-1 mice when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 32 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). In the C57BL/6 strain, Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen when given within 16 days, whereas a maximal 20-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 24 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). The mechanism of toxicologic enhancement was examined in male C57BL/6 mice using the same treatment regimen. Biochemical assessment of hepatotoxicity was confirmed by detailed histologic evaluation. Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Acetaminophen bioactivation was quantified by production of the glutathione-derived cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates of acetaminophen. Poly I-C pretreatment produced a 5-fold increase in acetaminophen-induced ALT release (P less than 0.05), which correlated with histologic evidence of centrilobular necrosis. Poly I-C pretreatment produced respective 3-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the production of cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates (P less than 0.05), which correlated with peak ALT concentrations (cysteine, r = 0.92, P less than 0.001; mercapturic acid, r = 0.75, P = 0.006). Thus, the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen can be inhibited when given within days after interferon induction, and conversely enhanced when given after several weeks. The toxicologic enhancement appears to be due to increased P-450-catalyzed bioactivation of acetaminophen.",652,0
Intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst: case report. A cervical intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst in a 39-year-old man is reported. Diagnosis was made through magnetic resonance imaging. Total enucleation was possible. This is the sixth such reported case.,61,1
"Treatment of hepatolithiasis: improvement of result by a systematic approach. In previous decades the result of treatment of hepatolithiasis has been unsatisfactory. The incidence of residual stones after surgery might reach 77%. In the past 6 years we adopted a systematic approach comprised of accurate delineation of disease in the liver and biliary tract by direct cholangiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography; tailored surgical treatment according to the extent of involvement of the liver and biliary tract; access to the intrahepatic ducts through the left duct or round ligament approach when there was difficulty with common bile duct exposure; routine use of flexible choledochoscopy; and application of electrohydraulic lithotripsy for large and impacted stones. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 114 of 127 patients (89.8%). Of those patients who had incomplete stone clearance, only six cases (4.7%) were related to technical failure of postoperative choledochoscopy. The incidence of stone recurrence was 15.8%, the lowest rate so far reported. It was the same regardless of whether a biliary drainage procedure had been performed, but the treatment for recurrent stones was facilitated by previous hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy. Overall the surgical treatment required for stone recurrence was of a lesser magnitude than that in the past.",269,0
"A biphasic pattern of anti-pre-S responses in acute hepatitis B virus infection. The clinical relevance of the immune response to the translation products of the pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions of hepatitis B virus was examined by testing sequential serum samples from 17 patients with acute self-limited hepatitis B and from two patients in whom chronic liver disease developed. Anti-pre-S antibodies were determined by enzyme immunoassays based on the inhibition of binding of monoclonal antibodies to epitopes in the pre-S1 and pre-S2 sequence. In acute, self-limited infection, anti-pre-S antibodies appeared in a biphasic pattern. The early antibodies were detected at the time of clinical signs of acute disease when HBsAg and often HBeAg were present, but hepatitis B virus DNA was no longer detectable in serum. Anti-pre-S levels then fell, but subsequently reappeared as the late antibody during the recovery phase, after development of anti-HBe, but before anti-HBs. Anti-pre-S responses were detected in 15 of 17 patients who recovered (88.2%) and in both patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection evolving to chronic liver disease. Although the early antibodies to pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins appeared at the time of decreasing levels of infectious virus in serum in cases of self-limited infection, these antibodies also were transiently or continuously present with high levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA in patients in whom chronic hepatitis B infection developed. Thus the anti-pre-S response in acute hepatitis is not a prognostic marker for clinical resolution.",335,0
"Radiobiological studies in the naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. The naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is described in a 43-year-old male. The response of dividing fibroblasts from this patient to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation was indistinguishable from that of a normal control: mean inactivation dose (D) = 1.74 Gy and 1.68 Gy, respectively. However, these cells were defective in the repair of potentially lethal damage (D = 2.36 Gy and 3.26 Gy, respectively). The response to radiation of Go T lymphocytes derived from the patient was similar to that of the control. The frequency of mutant circulating T lymphocytes resistant to 6-thioguanine was 17 x 10(-6) which was elevated when compared with age-matched controls. These results suggest an abnormality in the response of the fibroblasts to ionizing radiation damage.",186,1
"DNA and RNA flow cytometric study in multiple myeloma. Clinical correlations. Flow cytometric studies of cellular DNA and RNA content using the acridine-orange technique were conducted in 81 patients with multiple myeloma (MM). All patients were treated with the M-2 protocol and clinical response was evaluated according to the criteria of the Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force. Aneuploid DNA stemlines were found in 38.2% of untreated patients with a median DNA index (DNA-I) of 1.15 in marrow aspirates and 1.22 in biopsy specimens. The median percentage of cells with abnormal DNA content was 31.5 (aspirates) and 35 (biopsy specimens) and a positive correlation with the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells was observed. Significantly higher proliferation (S-phase) was found in marrow biopsy specimens as compared with marrow aspirates. Significantly higher RNA content (RNA index [RNA-I]) was observed in aneuploid versus diploid patients in biopsy material. There was no difference in response to the Memorial Hospital M-2 protocol between diploid and aneuploid patients. In patients with DNA-I greater than 1.15 remission duration was shorter as compared with DNA-I less than or equal to 1.15. Furthermore, no difference in cellular RNA content was noted between responders and nonresponders. This study demonstrates no correlation between cellular RNA content and response, as previously described for patients treated with vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD), but DNA aneuploidy appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in MM patients treated with the M-2 protocol. It also demonstrates that prognostic models for MM are not universal but depend on the chemotherapeutic regimen used.",362,1
"Assessment of dilation methods in achalasia: large diameter mercury bougienage followed by pneumatic dilation as needed. In a retrospective study, 33 achalasia patients were treated with dilation therapy using large diameter mercury bougienage (mean, 56 French) and/or pneumatic balloon dilation. Mean follow-up time was 35 months. Mercury bougienage, performed in 20 patients, was successful in 10 (50%) with no complications. Pneumatic dilation was performed as initial therapy or in those having failed previous pharmacologic therapy and/or bougienage. A successful response was achieved in 19 of 23 patients (83%), with a 3.2% complication rate. In addition, in four patients with eventual recurrence of symptoms after initial pneumatic dilation, bougienage was used as a successful alternative to repeat pneumatic treatment. The combined efficacy of both forms of dilation was 88% with a complication rate of 1.4%. These data indicate that mercury bougienage should be considered initial therapy for achalasia in view of its simplicity, safety, and acceptable efficacy, followed by pneumatic dilation if bougienage is unsuccessful. Bougienage also may be considered if eventual recurrent symptoms develop after initially successful pneumatic dilation. Surgery should be utilized only if dilation therapy fails to achieve a satisfactory response.",276,0
"The effect of alcohol in isolated blunt splenic trauma. The effect of alcohol on trauma patients is controversial, with numerous authors citing no difference in mortality in acutely intoxicated patients. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively investigate the effect of alcohol in adult patients with isolated blunt splenic injury. From 1980 through 1989, 47 adult patients with splenic trauma as the only major injury were admitted to the Trauma Service. There were 37 males and ten females with a mean age of 29 years (range, 15 to 61). Motor vehicle accidents were responsible for 44 (94%) of the injuries. Group 1 consisted of 24 patients with a mean blood alcohol level of 185 mg/dl (range, 15 to 380). In Group 2 there were 23 patients without detectable blood alcohol. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in age, Abbreviated Injury Severity Score, initial hematocrit, and grade of splenic injury. Hypotension was present in 13 patients (55%) in Group 1 versus six patients (26%) in Group 2 (p less than 0.05). Significant abnormalities in clotting studies were present on admission in six patients (25%) in the alcohol-detected group versus one in the other group (p less than 0.05). Blood transfusion requirements in the first 24 hours were significantly greater in Group 1 (mean, 3.9 units) versus Group 2 (mean, 0.5 units) (p less than 0.001). If alcohol was present, there was much less chance for splenic conservation, as 18 patients (75%) underwent splenectomy versus seven patients (30%) in the nonalcohol group (p less than 0.05). There was one death and this occurred in a patient acutely intoxicated who suffered a cerebral infarct.",415,0
"Image cytophotometric DNA analysis of atypical hyperplasias and intraductal carcinomas of the breast. With the use of image analysis, DNA content was quantified on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 25 atypical hyperplasias and 35 intraductal carcinomas of the breast by comparison of integrated gray levels of Feulgen-stained control and ductal cell nuclei. The mean full-peak (G0/G1) control cell DNA histogram coefficient of variation was 5.5%. DNA aneuploidy was more common in intraductal carcinomas compared with atypical hyperplasias (71% of intraductal carcinomas vs 36% of atypical hyperplasias) and correlated with a lack of cytologic (nuclear) and architectural differentiation (63% moderate vs 93% poor and 38% cribriform vs 82% solid). In addition, multiple DNA stemlines were observed in 40% of intraductal carcinomas. We conclude that (1) some atypical hyperplasias demonstrate abnormal DNA content consistent with neoplastic transformation, (2) aggressive forms of intraductal carcinoma are more frequently associated with DNA content abnormalities, and (3) frequent DNA stemline heterogeneity in intraductal carcinoma supports the hypothesis that multiple genetic events occur in the development of mammary intraepithelial neoplasia.",278,1
"The use of probenecid as a chemoprotector against cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Probenecid inhibits cisplatin (CP) secretion in humans and protects against CP-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. The authors conducted a Phase I trial of escalating doses of CP using probenecid as a chemoprotector. Fifty-four courses of CP at doses ranging from 100 to 160 mg/m2 were given by 24-hour infusion to 36 patients. There was no renal impairment at any dose. Ototoxicity, however, became the dose-limiting toxicity; 14 patients experienced a 20 or greater decibel (dB) loss. Seven percent of courses were associated with a leukocyte count of less than 1.5 x 10/microliters, and 19% with a platelet count of less than 50 x 10(3)/microliters. Only three patients developed neurotoxicity. Correlating pharmacokinetic data and toxicity, the authors found that high cumulative dose, area under the curve (AUC) for unbound platinum, and cumulative AUC were associated with ototoxicity and peripheral neuropathy. It was concluded that probenecid may protect against CP nephrotoxicity and warrants further investigation. Its unique mechanism of action and lack of toxicity make it ideal to combine with other chemoprotectors.",281,1
"Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in Leigh disease. An infant with Leigh disease, who was the younger sister of a similarly affected infant, had been examined before the onset of the disease. Ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic lesions in the putamen and caudate nucleus during the preclinical stage. At onset, these changes extended into the cerebral cortex and medulla. These lesions were also detected by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as areas of increased signal intensity. Her brother demonstrated the same ultrasonographic results; cranial computed tomography disclosed low-density areas in the basal ganglia which were detected as hyperechoic lesions by ultrasonography. These findings suggest that ultrasonography is useful in detecting early intracranial lesions in Leigh disease.",149,0
"Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents: theory and application to the central nervous system. The theoretical aspects of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agents are reviewed, and their current applications to the central nervous system (CNS) and their future applications are discussed. Profound differences exist between contrast agents used for MR imaging and computerized tomography (CT). In MR imaging, the contrast agents are not imaged directly but rather act on adjacent protons to shorten T1 and T2 relaxation times. This in turn results in signal intensity changes. The lanthanide metal, gadolinium, in the form of gadopentetate dimeglumine, has been found to be both safe and efficacious as the only currently approved contrast agent for MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging revolutionized the detection and treatment of disease affecting the brain and spine. Initially, it was thought that signal characteristics on MR imaging would allow differentiation of specific pathology. It was soon found that MR studies were able to detect more abnormalities but were less able to characterize them. The recent development of contrast agents for MR imaging has allowed this modality to surpass CT for the evaluation of most CNS lesions. At present, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is generally accepted as the study of choice for evaluating acoustic neurinomas, pituitary lesions, meningeal disease, primary and secondary brain tumors, active multiple sclerosis, intradural spinal neoplasms, intramedullary spinal disease, and postoperative states in both the spine and brain. Even when contrast-enhanced CT can detect the same abnormalities, evaluation of the lesions in multiple planes on MR imaging can sometimes yield invaluable information, especially prior to surgery. Future developments of contrast material for MR imaging include non-gadolinium compounds, intrathecal contrast media, cerebral blood flow and volume evaluation, and, possibly, antibody-labeled contrast agents.",362,1
"Chylous ascites should suggest constrictive pericarditis even in a patient with cirrhosis. Chylous ascites, a milky, high triglyceride fluid is usually found in patients with lymphatic obstruction from malignancy. We describe a patient with cirrhosis who developed constrictive pericarditis and chylous ascites. Long-standing portal hypertension compounded by elevated central venous pressure provided several pathophysiologic contributions to the formation of the chylous ascites. Chylous ascites even in a cirrhotic requires prompt assessment for conditions leading to elevated central venous pressure. ",116,0
"Surgical strategy for early gastric cancer. The diagnostic and therapeutic options in early gastric cancer are reviewed. In Japan, the rate of detection of early gastric cancers has increased so that minute gastric cancers can now be identified as a result of advances in diagnostic methods. The results of histopathological staging of a large number of resected specimens have led to three surgical options based on size and depth of the primary lesion, namely classical R2 resection, radical resection with limited lymphadenectomy and endoscopic surgery.",98,1
"Imaging modalities in recurrent head and neck tumors. Patients with recurrent neoplasms of the head and neck present perplexing management problems, and accurate preoperative assessment of their disease is crucial. Thirty-eight patients with suspected recurrent neoplasms comprise this study: 30 had computed tomography scans, 4 had magnetic resonance images, and 4 patients underwent both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to assess the anatomical extent of pathology in 34 malignant and 4 benign tumors. Contrast enhancement was essential for detecting disease on computed tomography scan. Differentiation of recurrent tumor was more difficult when the patient had undergone radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated superior visibility in recurrent parotid and paranasal sinus neoplasm, but was less helpful in laryngeal and pharyngeal recurrences. Computed tomography demonstration of a mass with infiltration of normal fat or tissue planes or lymphadenopathy correlated highly with recurrent disease. Imaging techniques and fine points for determining recurrent neoplasms are presented.",187,1
"Epidermoid cysts of the brain stem. Report of three cases. The authors report the cases of three patients with epidermoid cysts which insinuated themselves into the brain stem. In all three patients, the tumor occupied the pons, although in one it was predominantly located in the medulla. The cyst contents and nonadherent tumor capsule were removed in all three patients, but no attempt was made to remove tumor densely adherent to the brain stem. One patient's cyst was removed in one operation, but maximal resection in the other two required two operations. After surgery, sixth nerve function completely returned in one patient; another patient had a stable pontine gaze palsy but developed new facial weakness; and the third patient had stable cranial nerve deficits with a diminished hemiparesis. The last patient developed a pseudomeningocele and communicating hydrocephalus, and required a lumboperitoneal shunt. In all three patients, computerized tomography scans demonstrated hypodense tumors not enhanced by contrast material. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on two patients; in both, the tumors showed increased signal intensity relative to brain on T1-weighted images and decreased signal intensity relative to brain on T2-weighted studies. Magnetic resonance imaging, the most accurate modality for localizing these lesions and determining their extent, was also invaluable for postoperative monitoring and follow-up evaluation. Safe and adequate resection includes decompression of cyst contents and removal of nonadherent portions of the cyst capsule. Cyst wall adherent to the brain stem, however, should not be removed.",303,1
"Immunohistochemical study of fibronectin in experimental myocardial infarction. Light microscopic immunohistochemical studies were performed to evaluate the distribution of fibronectin in paraffin sections of p-formaldehyde-fixed normal rat hearts and the hearts of rats that had undergone ligation of the left coronary artery. A peroxidase-labeled antibody technique was used, together with appropriate immunohistochemical control procedures, for the localization of fibronectin in normal hearts and in the hearts of sham-operated animals. Fibronectin was localized in the interstitial space between myocytes, and beneath arterial, venous, and capillary endothelium. At 4 hours after coronary ligation, fibronectin was localized in a patchy fashion in the cytoplasm and interstitial space of some of the myocytes in the area supplied by the ligated vessel. At 24 hours, there was more intense, homogeneous staining in necrotic myocytes in the infarcted area and in the capillary endothelium in the border zone. At 48 hours, the intensity of staining for fibronectin was maximal in and between the necrotic myocytes in the center of the infarct and in proliferating and migrating capillaries and fibroblasts in the border zone. Similar patterns of localization were observed at 3 and 7 days after coronary ligation, but with progressive decreases in the intensity of staining. Two sources of fibronectin appeared to have contributed to these changes: plasma fibronectin diffusing through damaged blood vessels would account for the early staining observed in necrotic myocytes in the center of the infarct, whereas de novo synthesis of fibronectin by connective tissue cells and endothelial cells in sprouting capillaries would be responsible for the subsequent staining observed in viable capillaries in the border zone of the infarct. Known properties of fibronectin in vitro, combined with these in vivo observations, indicate that fibronectin may influence the thrombotic, inflammatory, angiogenic, and fibrotic processes involved in infarct healing.",386,0
"Recurrent prolonged erections and priapism as a sequela of priapism: pathophysiology and management. Veno-occlusive priapism may be associated with prolonged corporeal ischemia, subsequent fibrosis of the corpora and impotence. We report on 6 patients who presented with an unusual sequela of veno-occlusive priapism, recurrent episodes of prolonged erections or priapism. In all cases the subsequent episodes were idiopathic and veno-occlusive, occurred with a frequency ranging from several times per day to once per month and were symptomatically disabling. Pharmacocavernosometry ruled out mechanical occlusion of corporeal venous drainage by demonstrating elevated flows to maintain intracavernosal pressures following smooth muscle contraction and markedly decreased flow rates following smooth muscle relaxation. Treatment of the recurrent episodes with intracavernous self-injection of phenylephrine resulted in successful detumescence. The use of oral phenylpropanolamine reduced the frequency and duration of the recurrences, and markedly reduced the need for adrenergic self-injection. It is proposed that this syndrome may develop secondary to the initial ischemic episode, resulting in a functional alteration of the adrenergic and/or endothelial-mediated mechanisms that control penile tumescence and maintain penile flaccidity.",256,0
"Diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Clinical importance, surgical treatment, and follow-up study. A diffuse sclerosing variant is not very rare among papillary carcinomas of the thyroid when the patients are female and younger than 30 years of age. The variant is characterized by diffuse involvement of one or both thyroid lobes, with dense sclerosis, patchy lymphocytic infiltration, and abundant psammoma bodies. Controversy still exists concerning its prognosis. We reviewed our experience with 14 patients treated between 1958 and 1988. All patients were young females, their age being from 10 to 28 years with a mean of 19.6. Hashimoto's thyroiditis had been suspected in nine patients before they came to our clinic. Nowadays the diagnosis of this cancer is possible when we have this entity in mind and detect abundant psammoma bodies either by ultrasonography or by soft-tissue roentgenography of the neck. Total thyroidectomy with modified neck dissection was carried out in eight patients, subtotal thyroidectomy with neck dissection in five, and lobectomy with neck dissection in one. All of them are alive and well without distant metastasis at a mean follow-up of 16 years. Because most of the patients with this variant of papillary carcinoma are young women and the prognosis is favorable, a complete resection without causing later recurrence, but also cosmetic and complication-free surgery, should be considered.",304,1
"Receptors for epidermal growth factor and steroid hormones in primary laryngeal tumors. The authors investigated the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF-R), estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and androgen (AR) receptors in 42 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas and 20 normal laryngeal mucosa specimens. EGF-R were expressed in all tumor specimens analyzed, with significantly higher levels in tumor samples compared with normal mucosa (P less than 0.05). The immunohistochemical study demonstrated the presence of EGF-R in basal and parabasal cells of normal mucosa and in most of the cancer cells. There was no correlation between EGF-R and tumor localization or T classification. On the other hand, the authors did find an interesting correlation between EGF-R levels and grading, EGF-R levels being significantly higher in G3 than in G1-G2 tumors. Moreover, the three patients whose tumors expressed the highest EGF-R levels had disease recur within 8 months. Among tumor specimens, 9.5%, 35.7%, and 9.5% expressed very low but detectable ER, PR, and AR levels, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the levels of steroid receptors in the tumor and normal mucosa specimens, and neither was there any correlation of ER, PR, and AR with the pathologic findings. The authors' results suggest that the EGF-R system may play a role in regulating the growth of laryngeal cancer. Additional studies should demonstrate whether, as in other tumor types, EGF-R expression may have prognostic significance in human laryngeal cancer.",334,1
"When epilepsy masquerades as heart disease. Awareness is key to avoiding misdiagnosis. Autonomic neural impulses that accompany discharges during a seizure can cause a variety of cardiac manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias, sudden death, anginal chest pain, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Either generalized or focal seizures may generate such signs and symptoms. A better appreciation of cardiac problems caused by epilepsy is helpful in preventing misdiagnosis, because the clinical picture in such a patient may be confusing. ",102,0
AAEM case report #1: ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. A patient with bilateral cubital syndrome complicated by anomalous innervation is presented.

Radiology for cochlear implants. One fifth of patients selected for cochlear implants have such bony irregularities in the cochlear duct that full insertion of a multichannel electrode array is impossible. Three cases of cochlear deafness are presented where pre- and post-operative radiology played an important part in the management. Standard CT at 2 mm cuts is compared with ultra high resolution CT at 1 mm cuts. The pitfall of poor definition is that the inexperienced surgeon may find himself unexpectedly drilling out an obliterated cochlear duct. Sections 30 degrees caudal to Reid's infra orbito-meatal base line at 1 mm intervals give maximum information for minimum radiation. Plain films show the placement of individual platinum electrode contacts in relation to the spiral 'frequency map' of the cochlea. This is vital information for the audiologist who has to route specific frequencies to specific sites within the ear for a good hearing result.,185,0
"Measles-associated diarrhea in hospitalized children in Lima, Peru: pathogenic agents and impact on growth. Because the causes of measles-associated diarrhea are not well known, 0- to 5-year-old children presenting to the hospital with measles-associated diarrhea (cases, n = 77) or acute diarrhea only (controls, n = 77) were compared. Growth and diarrheal morbidity were evaluated for 1 month after acute illness. Campylobacter jejuni was more frequently isolated from cases (31%) than controls (16%; P = .03). Rotavirus was absent in all cases versus 28% of controls (P less than .001). Incidence density for new episodes of diarrhea was significantly greater in cases (6.5 vs. 4.1; odds ratio, 1.6; confidence intervals, 1.09-2.34; P = .01), as was duration of episodes (3 vs. 2 days, P = .02). Both groups showed similar positive cumulative percentage weight gains throughout follow-up. These data support the theory of measles as a risk factor for developing diarrhea. The bacteriologic and virologic findings may reflect the immunologic response of the host to measles infection.",264,0
"Holter monitoring of ventricular arrhythmias in a randomised, controlled study of intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias attributed to streptokinase treatment in acute myocardial infarction is not well defined. Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours in 81 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to intravenous streptokinase 1.5 x 10(6) IU (n = 55) or placebo infusion (n = 26) 6.7 hours (mean) after the onset of symptoms. No episodes of ventricular fibrillation were recorded. For the whole 24 hour period and during the first three hours after the start of treatment the incidence and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias were similar in the patients randomised to streptokinase and to placebo. But when the results in patients randomised ""early"" after the onset of symptoms of suspected acute myocardial infarction were analysed separately the frequency of abnormal complexes, pairs, runs, and repetitive arrhythmias seemed to be higher in patients allocated to streptokinase. This may reflect arrhythmias associated with reperfusion.",225,0
"Clinical features and natural history of von Hippel-Lindau disease The clinical features, age at onset and survival of 152 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease were studied. Mean age at onset was 26.3 years and 97 per cent of patients had presented by aged 60 years. Retinal angioma was the first manifestation in 65 patients (43 per cent), followed by cerebellar haemangioblastoma (n = 60, 39 per cent) and renal cell carcinoma (n = 15, 10 per cent). Overall, 89 patients (59 per cent) developed a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, 89 (59 per cent) a retinal angioma, 43 (28 per cent) renal cell carcinoma, 20 (13 per cent) spinal haemangioblastoma and 11 (7 per cent) a phaeochromocytoma. Renal, pancreatic and epididymal cysts were frequent findings but their exact incidence was not accurately assessed. Mean age at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (44.0 +/- 10.9 years) was significantly older than that for cerebellar haemangioblastoma (29.0 +/- 10.0 years) and retinal angioma (25.4 +/- 12.7 years). The probability of a patient with von Hippel-Lindan disease developing a cerebellar haemangioblastoma, retinal angioma or renal cell carcinoma by age 60 years was 0.84, 0.7 and 0.69, respectively. A comprehensive screening protocol for affected patients and at-risk relatives is presented, based on detailed analysis of age at onset data for each of the major complications. Median actuarial survival was 49 years, with renal cell carcinoma the leading cause of death.",388,1
"Miscellaneous adverse effects of low-versus high-osmolality contrast media: a study revised The authors analyzed data from two recent articles in Radiology in which the quality and results of randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy or safety of the low-osmolality contrast media (LOM) iopamidol, iohexol, and ioxaglate with that of the high-osmolarity contrast media (HOM) diatrizoate, iodamide, iopamide, iothalamate, and metrizoate were assessed. One conclusion in the source articles was that no differences were seen between the two groups of contrast media in frequency of nausea, vomiting, and urticaria. However, the LOM group included both nonionic LOM (NIM) and the ionic contrast medium ioxaglate. The authors found that various complications associated with the use of contrast media were much less common with NIM than with HOM; statistically this lower frequency is highly significant. This difference was obscured in the previous studies by the pooling of RCTs in which the less toxic NIM were used and RCTs in which the more toxic ionic contrast medium ioxaglate was used. ",240,0
"Delayed rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk: treatment with therapeutic embolization. Fourteen days after removal of an internal jugular catheter inserted prior to renal transplantation, a patient presented with brisk arterial hemorrhage from the insertion site.

"Meningiomas mimicking cerebral schwannoma. A brain tumor with histological features reminiscent of schwannoma with underlying meningioangiomatosis was subjected to electron microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis, which confirmed the neoplasm as a meningioma. This prompted reexamination of a similar tumor, described in a previous publication as a cerebral schwannoma, with identical immunohistochemical techniques. The results obtained favored alteration of this diagnosis to that of meningioma. This experience has led the authors to recommend the use of immunohistochemistry techniques when evaluating unusual intracranial neoplasms. ",111,0
"Biliobiliary fistula: preoperative diagnosis and management implications. Experience with cholecystohepaticodochal and cholecystocholedochal fistulas as a result of an erosion of gallstones from the gallbladder into the adjacent common duct in five patients is presented. The incidence was 1.4% in a population of 350 patients undergoing cholecystectomy. The condition was indicated clinically on the basis of a symptom triad of jaundice, fever, and pain with cholelithiasis in a small contracted gallbladder. In addition, proximal intra- and extrahepatic ductal dilatation, calculus in the common duct, and normal-caliber (or unprofiled) distal common duct on ultrasound scan were present in all the patients. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography proved to be the most useful means of investigation, and it confirmed the diagnosis in four patients before surgery. A modified antegrade cholecystectomy was performed with the gallbladder opened inferiorly at the fundus, and the stones were evacuated. A partial cholecystectomy and choledochoplasty were accomplished with gallbladder flaps whenever feasible. Other useful operative procedures are side-to-side hepaticodochojejunostomy and hepaticodochoduodenostomy. In the presence of high benign bile duct stricture, an approach to the left hepatic duct is now preferred for biliary bypass.",277,0
"Resting and total energy expenditure in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease often present with weight loss. Among possible causes, an elevated energy expenditure has frequently been suggested but is the least documented. In this study resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) were measured in 15 outpatients with inflammatory bowel diseases and in eight healthy control subjects. Measured RMR as a percentage of that predicted from fat-free mass was not significantly different for control subjects (102 +/- 9.8%, mean +/- SD) and patients (100 +/- 13.3%). TDEE, expressed as a multiple of RMR, was 1.70 +/- 0.31 for control subjects and 1.78 +/- 0.24 for patients. When patients were subgrouped as greater than or equal to 90% or less than 90% desirable body weight, a mean increase over RMR predicted from fat-free mass was seen in the underweight patients (106 +/- 9.3%) but not in normal-weight patients (99.0 +/- 15.6%). Mean TDEE/RMR values for the patient subgroups were 1.70 +/- 0.30 and 1.88 +/- 0.08, respectively. We conclude that stable outpatients with inflammatory bowel disease have only a minimal increase in energy needs.",301,0
"Cyclosporine enhances the growth of carcinogen-induced enzyme-altered foci in rat liver. Cyclosporine, a powerful immunosuppressant, has been used successfully for organ transplantation. Its efficacy on liver transplants of patients with primary hepatic tumors remains controversial because of a high rate of recurrence of the original tumors in the transplanted livers. In this study, we experimentally tested whether cyclosporine exerts any effects on the growth of carcinogen-initiated liver cells using the short-term assays of rat liver carcinogenesis. Dietary cyclosporine, which maintained sufficient levels of blood cyclosporine and suppressed host immune functions, enhanced the development of the glutathione S-transferase, placental form-positive hepatocyte foci in the liver of male F-344 rats treated with a single weekly dose of diethylnitrosamine (75 mg/kg) for 3 wk. Dietary cyclosporine also accelerated the growth of preformed glutathione S-transferase, placental form-positive foci induced by a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (250 mg/kg) followed by the promoting regimen of a choline-deficient diet. It is possible that the enhancement of the size of hepatocyte foci by cyclosporine could be due to stimulation of growth or inhibition of regression. The mechanisms by which cyclosporine modifies the growth of preneoplastic lesions in the liver are not yet fully understood. Possible involvement of immunologically relevant cells in the liver, Kupffer cells and pit cells in the process is suggested.",302,1

"Steroid cell tumor of the ovary in a child. An 8-year-old girl exhibited severe, progressive virilization of 2 years' duration associated with markedly elevated circulating testosterone concentrations. Based on her initial clinical presentation and results of a chemical evaluation, she was originally thought to have non-classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but her condition did not respond to corticosteroid therapy. Further evaluation confirmed the presence of an ovarian neoplasm. The excised ovary contained an attached gray-brown mass. Light microscopic and ultrastructural examination revealed the mass to be a steroid cell tumor. Because Reinke's crystals were not present, it was designated to be a steroid cell tumor not otherwise specified. This case represents one of 22 reported cases of steroid cell tumor occurring in children described in the literature, most of which have been associated with heterosexual precocity. To our knowledge, steroid cell tumors are benign when they occur in prepubertal children. Although they are rare, steroid cell tumors of the ovary should be considered in cases of childhood virilization.",215,1
"The relationship of headache symptoms with severity and duration of attacks. Efforts to develop clinically useful headache classification schemes have generally focused on linking specific symptom groupings with specific headache subtypes. An alternative conceptual approach, the ""severity model"" of headache, considers a continuum of headache ranging from mild to severe forms with specific headache subtypes distinguished by level of severity rather than unique constellations of symptoms. A population-based telephone interview was carried out among 10,169 subjects aged 12-29 to estimate the prevalence of serious headaches and better characterize symptoms that accompany headache attacks. In an analysis of frequency of occurrence, pain and duration of recent (within 4 weeks prior to interview) headache attacks, the data revealed that common symptoms (such as forehead pain and pain in the back of the head, neck and shoulders) were reported frequently, but headaches with these symptoms were generally characterized by low levels of pain and short duration. Although not an original study objective, the data were analyzed to determine whether distinct symptom constellations could be identified or whether symptoms overlapped between headache types. Symptoms of migraine were frequently experienced concomitant with tension-type symptoms; the resultant headaches were usually characterized as moderate in intensity. In contrast, symptoms usually associated with migraine in the absence of concomitant tension-type symptoms were infrequently experienced, but resulted in headaches causing the greatest disability. The data provide some support for the severity model of headache.",279,0
"The role of methanethiol in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Mixed disulfides of methanethiol represent a relative estimate for an exposure to methanethiol. The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides, methionine, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and ammonia were measured in patients with different stages of hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with chronic kidney failure and in healthy subjects. In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, the mean serum concentrations of all these compounds were elevated. However, the elevations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were small and partly caused by decreased renal function. In addition, the levels of methanethiol-mixed disulfides did not differ significantly between the different grades of hepatic encephalopathy. The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were substantially lower than those previously observed in healthy subjects after an oral methionine load or in a patient with a deficiency in methionine adenosyltransferase, the latter without causing encephalopathy. We concluded that the role of methanethiol in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is probably minor, if not insignificant. In the patients with hepatic encephalopathy, a significant correlation was found between the concentrations of methionine and 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and between 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and methanethiol-mixed disulfides, supporting the theory that methanethiol is formed by way of the methionine transamination pathway. Evidence is provided that, besides the methionine transsulfuration pathway, the transamination pathway is also impaired in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.",332,0
"Lung cancer in patients younger than 40 years of age. The records of 52 patients younger than 40 years of age who had bronchogenic carcinoma diagnosed between 1965 and 1985 were reviewed. The preponderance of adenocarcinoma (54%), the lower male-female ratio in this age group compared with patients age 40 or older (2:1), the importance of cigarette smoking as a causative factor (80% of patients), the long mean duration of symptoms (5 months), and the high incidence of advanced stage at diagnosis (77% Stages III and IV) in these patients are findings similar to those reported in other published series. There was no significant difference in resectability (23% versus 19%), median survival length (5.3 months versus 6.9 months), median survival length of patients who had surgical resection (10.5 months versus 10.8 months), and 5-year survival rate (11.5% versus 6.3%) in these patients compared with a randomly selected group of 260 patients with lung cancer who were age 40 or older.",243,1
"Cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from nonneoplastic liver. The authors reviewed a series of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens of the liver to identify useful cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from nonneoplastic liver. Ten cytologic features were examined in this study: high cellularity, acinar pattern, trabecular pattern, hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, irregularly granular chromatin, uniformly prominent nucleoli, multiple nucleoli, increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei. These features were examined in a series of 82 FNAB specimens from 52 patients with HCC and 30 patients with nonneoplastic lesions. With the use of a step-wise logistic regression analysis, three features were identified as predictive of HCC: increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (P = 0.001), trabecular pattern (P = 0.002), and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei (P = 0.03). When these three criteria were used, the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC by FNAB was 100%, and the specificity was 87%.",238,0
"Right ventricular dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evaluation and management. Cor pulmonale is an important consequence of COPD. Although the incidence is not precisely known, it is seen more frequently in patients with hypoxemia, CO2 retention and severely reduced FEV1. When present, it limits peripheral oxygen delivery, increases shortness of breath, and reduces exercise endurance. It is also associated with higher mortality rates independent of other prognostic variables. Numerous factors may contribute to the development of cor pulmonale in patients with COPD, but its primary cause is chronic alveolar hypoxia resulting in pulmonary vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. The physical exam, chest radiograph and ECG may be helpful in detecting the presence of cor pulmonale, but because of anatomic changes that occur in the chest, these tests are often insensitive in patients with COPD. Noninvasive diagnostic techniques utilizing Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide angiography allow for detection of RV dysfunction at an earlier stage and in most cases, preclude the need for right heart catheterization. LTO2 is the only therapy shown to improve survival in patients with COPD. However, statistical proof correlating improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics with increased survival is lacking. Bronchodilators, such as the beta 2 agonists and especially theophylline, may have beneficial effects on pulmonary hemodynamics in addition to their effect on respiratory function and are useful in COPD when RV dysfunction is present. Diuretics and phlebotomy are also useful in improving symptoms in appropriate patients. Vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors may improve pulmonary hemodynamics acutely, but may lower arterial PO2 by worsening ventilation-perfusion matching or blunt the improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics seen with supplemental oxygen. The long-term benefits of these agents have not been proven and their routine use in patients with cor pulmonale due to COPD cannot be recommended.",372,0
"Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a clinical and EEG study of five cases. In five children with normal initial psychomotor development, a Landau-Kleffner syndrome appeared at age 3-7 years. No neuroanatomic lesions were noted. Aphasia and hyperkinesia were isolated in three patients and associated with global regression of higher cortical functions in one patient. Massive intellectual deterioration and psychotic behavior were associated with transient aphasia in one patient. The epilepsy (focal motor and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, subclinical EEG focal seizures during sleep, and atypical absences) always regressed spontaneously or with antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The EEG in waking patients showed focal and generalized spike-wave discharges on a normal background rhythm. Discharge topography and pattern changed frequently. During sleep, discharges always increased. At some time during syndrome development, all patients had bilateral spike-waves for greater than 85% of the sleep period, while at other times the discharges were discontinuous or continuous but focal or unilaterally hemispheric. Discharge topography and abundance changed from night to night. The abnormal EEG and the impaired higher functions developed and regressed together, but not with strict temporal correlation. Our own experience suggests that the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and epilepsy with continuous spike-wave activity in slow-wave sleep cannot be clearly differentiated. They may be different points on the spectrum of a single syndrome.",284,0
Nd:YAG-laser in the microsurgery of frontobasal meningiomas. Forty-three patients with big frontobasal meningiomas underwent a microsurgical removal of the tumor. The 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser has proved useful in this prospective series particularly with the contactless shrinkage of the tumors and the necrotization of the dural and bony attachments. Tumor shrinkage was achieved by radiating the tumor surface with the Nd:YAG-laser. This technique facilitated the microsurgical dissection and reduced the blood loss by half. The Nd:YAG-laser necrotization of the dural and bony attachments reduced the recurrence rate following grade two resections from 20% to zero. The postoperative quality of life was excellent with a complete rehabilitation in 76% of the patients. The use of the 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser improved significantly the results of microsurgery for frontobasal meningioma.,199,1
"Fallopian tube cancer. The Roswell Park experience. Sixty-four patients with primary fallopian tube cancer treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute from 1964 to 1987 underwent retrospective clinicopathologic review. In 40 patients fallopian tube cancer was the only primary, but in 24 patients primary fallopian tube cancer was part of a multifocal upper genital tract malignancy. Of the 40 patients with unifocal fallopian disease, the median survival was 28 months. Only 15% of patients were alive and disease free with follow-up ranging from 22 to 141 months (median, 90.5 months). Survival was not associated with stage of disease, tumor histology, grade, or depth of invasion in this series. Fourteen patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy were evaluable for response. Three patients (21%) responded; two complete and one partial. Twelve patients without clinical evidence of disease underwent second-look procedures, ten laparotomy and two laparoscopy. Four of ten second-look laparotomies were negative. Secondary debulking was done in three of four patients with gross disease, one of which had a negative third-look laparotomy. Negative laparotomy, second-look or third-look, was associated with improved survival (P = 0.016). One of the two laparoscopies was negative, but the patient recurred. In the remaining 24 patients cancer of the fallopian tube was part of a multifocal upper genital tract malignancy. In 12 patients tubal disease was invasive, and in 12, it was in situ. Separate primaries occurred in the ovaries (n = 20); uterus (n = 7); and cervix (n = 2). This represents 1.3% of ovarian malignancies treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute during the study period. Fallopian tube cancer seems as virulent as ovarian cancer with few long-term survivors. It is frequently associated with other sites of upper genital tract malignancy. Second-look laparotomy is an important predictor of survival. Second-look laparoscopy may be useful if positive.",447,1
"Clinical management of gastric cancer and concomitant esophagogastric varices. We report the late results of treatment of 13 consecutive patients with gastric cancer and concomitant esophagogastric varices. Of seven good-risk patients classified as Child's class A or B, gastrectomy together with selective shunt operation was performed in two, total gastrectomy with splenectomy in three, and distal partial gastrectomy with paraesophageal devascularization without splenectomy in one. The remaining patient with early gastric cancer underwent distal partial gastrectomy following repeated endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) for treatment of the esophageal varices. Although the majority of patients who underwent surgical repair of varices (i.e., shunt, splenectomy, or devascularization) died, total gastrectomy with splenectomy was the only procedure that led to control of the esophageal varices. Since partial gastrectomy combined with EIS limits the morbidity and mortality of an extensive resection and at the same time controls esophageal variceal bleeding, it is probably the procedure of choice for patients with a carcinoma in the lower two-thirds of the stomach. Concerning non-surgical cases, two patients were effectively treated using laser endoscopy and EIS, without the occurrence of variceal bleeding. The remaining four patients, given chemotherapy or irradiation for treatment of gastric carcinoma, died within 4 months with variceal bleeding or liver failure. For the poor-risk patients with evidence of severe liver dysfunction, laser treatment and EIS would be the treatment of choice.",311,0

"E1a-dependent expression of adenovirus genes in OTF963 embryonal carcinoma cells: role of E1a-induced differentiation. Some undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells allow adenovirus genes to be expressed independently of the E1a oncogene normally required for their activation; this has been attributed to a cellular equivalent of E1a in F9 cells. However, transcription of all early genes was low in undifferentiated OTF963 embryonic carcinoma cells during the first 48 hr after infection with adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Transcription then increased to about the level seen 16 hr after infection of cells induced to differentiate by retinoic acid (RA) (referred to as RA-dF9 cells), but this increase did not occur in cells infected by the E1a deletion mutant dl312. Addition of E1a in trans, or of RA, had no immediate effect on viral transcription in OTF963 cells, but viral transcription increased about 48 hr after these additions. Ad5 induced transcription of several differentiation-specific genes in OTF963 cells with about the same kinetics as their induction by RA. These genes were superinduced in RA-dF9 cells by cAMP or infection by adenovirus. We suggest the small amount of E1a produced early in infection of OTF963 cells activates cellular genes, some of which are differentiation specific and required for efficient transcription of viral genes, so that E1a both induces and is induced by differentiation. The simple hypothesis of a cellular equivalent to E1a does not adequately explain the complex interactions between viral and cellular genes in OTF963 embryonic carcinoma cells.",347,1
"High-risk factors in metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The patient with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia faces a number of risks; the greatest is the failure of current treatment to bring about remission. Based on a review of past experience, a number of risk factors associated with failure of single-agent chemotherapy were identified, and the subsequent utilization of combination chemotherapy led to an improved outcome. An analysis of more recent experience has identified factors associated with the failure of standard combination chemotherapy, and it is hoped that the development of new treatments will again improve the outcome. This review provides a perspective on known high-risk factors in light of contemporary treatment. ",131,1
"Medicare Peer Review Organization preprocedure review criteria. An analysis of criteria for three procedures The Medicare Peer Review Organization (PRO) program includes preprocedure review using explicit criteria to assess the appropriateness of specific procedures. This study evaluates the variability in the PRO preprocedure criteria for the three procedures most frequently reviewed by PROs: carotid endarterectomy, cataract removal, and cardiac pacemaker implants. In August 1989, the PRO review criteria were received from the Health Care Financing Administration. To provide a reference point for reviewing the PRO criteria, national practice guidelines for these three procedures were identified. Wide variability was demonstrated in the PRO procedure-specific carotid endarterectomy and cataract removal review criteria among PROs, and the criteria differed significantly from the identified practice guidelines. The criteria for cardiac pacemaker implants were somewhat less variable, and were based, to varying degrees, on practice guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC). Greater attention is needed to improve the development of review criteria, including the use of relevant practice guidelines, to ensure that review criteria are optimal.",212,0
"Long term follow-up of descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral bypass. A prospective study of 26 patients undergoing descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral (DTAI/F) bypass was conducted over a 13-year period with an average follow up of 53 months. Reasons for selecting the procedure were occluded aortic bifurcation grafts (9 patients), hostile abdomen (6), infected aortic graft (1), microaorta (10, and surgeons preference in 8 patients who had juxtarenal aortic occlusion. The operative mortality was 3.8% (1 patient). A late mortality of 36% was due to myocardial infarction (1), lung carcinoma (2), renal failure (4), stroke (1) and pulmonary insufficiency (1). Graft failure occurred in 4 patients at 23, 26, 54 and 109 months respectively. Primary cumulative patency was 86% statistically valid at 42 months. DTAI/F bypass is recommended in selected patients when conventional approaches to the aorta are considered unduly hazardous.",228,0
"Blockade of prostaglandin production increases cachectin synthesis and prevents depression of macrophage functions after hemorrhagic shock. Although hemorrhage severely depresses macrophage functions, it is not known whether the increased TNF-alpha or PGE2 production is responsible for it. To study this C3H/HeN mice were bled to mean blood pressure of 35 mmHg for 60 minutes, resuscitated, and treated with either ibuprofen (1.0 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline). Hemorrhage increased plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels by 151.7% +/- 40.0% (p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased peritoneal macrophage (pM phi) antigen presentation (AP) by 60.5% +/- 7.3%, Ia expression by 52.3% +/- 7.6%, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) synthesis by 60.5% +/- 12.3% compared to shams. However ibuprofen treatment reduced PGE2 plasma levels by 61.3% +/- 12.1% and significantly increased AP (+237.0% +/- 95.3%), Ia expression (+72.8% +/- 27.5%), IL-1 synthesis (+235.7% +/- 134.7%), and cachectin synthesis (+485.8% +/- 209.0%) compared to vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that prostaglandins but not cachectin are involved in the suppression of pM phi functions following hemorrhage because blockade of prostaglandin synthesis improved depressed macrophage functions despite enhanced cachectin synthesis.",351,0
"Coronary arterial remodeling studied by high-frequency epicardial echocardiography: an early compensatory mechanism in patients with obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Coronary arterial remodeling is a compensatory mechanism that may limit the adverse effects of coronary obstructive lesions by expansion of the entire vascular segment. To determine if this compensatory anatomic change occurs in patients, high-frequency epicardial echocardiography using a 12 MHz transducer was performed during open heart surgery in 33 patients (10 with normal coronary arteries undergoing valvular surgery and 23 with coronary atherosclerosis). From stop-frame videotape high-frequency epicardial echocardiographic images, cross-sectional measurements of luminal area and total arterial area (lumen, intima, media and dense adventitia) were made in the patients with atherosclerosis at the site of arterial lesions and from the most proximal portion of the same artery. Remodeling was defined as enlargement of the total arterial area. In normal arteries measurements were made from proximal and midarterial locations. In the patients with normal coronary arteries, total arterial area, as determined by high-frequency echocardiography, decreased from the proximal site to the midportion of the artery (from 10.4 +/- 0.9 to 8.4 +/- 1.0 mm2, p less than 0.05); luminal area also decreased (from 6.0 +/- 0.6 to 4.5 +/- 0.7 mm2, p less than 0.05). In patients with coronary arterial lesions, luminal area also decreased from the proximal site to the arterial lesion site (from 5.3 +/- 0.6 to 2.3 +/- 0.3 mm2, p less than 0.05), but total arterial area increased (from 11.6 +/- 1.0 to 13.0 +/- 1.0 mm2, p less than 0.05). Of the 25 coronary arteries evaluated, only 4 had angiographic evidence of coronary collateral formation. These data indicate that coronary arterial remodeling is an important compensatory mechanism in obstructive coronary disease.",437,0
"Dentofacial development in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A comparison of three treatment modalities. Ninety-seven children who were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia before 10 years of age and treated with chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus 1800-cGy cranial irradiation (RT), or chemotherapy plus 2400-cGy RT were evaluated for effects of therapy on dentofacial development. All patients were seen at least 5 years postdiagnosis. Dental abnormalities were determined from panoramic radiographs, and craniofacial evaluations were made from lateral cephalometric radiographs. Ninety-one (94%) of all patients and 41 (100%) of patients younger than 5 years of age at diagnosis had abnormal dental development. The severity of these abnormalities was greater in children who received treatment before 5 years of age and in those who received RT. Observed dental abnormalities included tooth agenesis, arrested root development, microdontia, and enamel dysplasias. Craniofacial abnormalities occurred in 18 of 20 (90%) of those patients who received chemotherapy plus 2400-cGy RT before 5 years of age. Mean cephalometric values of this group showed significant deficient mandibular development. The results of this study suggest that the severity of dentofacial-developmental abnormalities secondary to antileukemia therapy are related to the age of the patient at the initiation of treatment and the use of cranial RT.",301,1
"Immunocytochemical localization of progesterone receptors in endocrine cells of the human pancreas. Progesterone receptors (PgR) have been immunocytochemically localized in the nuclei of several (40% to 75%) endocrine cells of the human pancreas and in a more variable number of neoplastic cells of 7 of 18 endocrine pancreatic tumors. Conversely the exocrine epithelial cells of the pancreas did not exhibit any PgR immunoreactivity in normal as well as in different pathologic conditions, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Estrogen receptors were not detected in any of the pancreatic samples investigated. Double immunocytochemical experiments have documented that PgR immunoreactivity in normal Langerhans islets is a consistent feature of most (75%) glucagon-producing A cells, of approximately 5% to 20% of insulin-producing B cells, and of a variable percentage of pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-producing cells, ranging from 5% to 70%. These figures were not affected by the sex, age, or underlying disease of the patients. The reported findings corroborate previous clinical and experimental evidence indicating that sex steroid hormones may have some regulatory effects on the functional activity of the endocrine pancreas.",244,1
"Local recurrence and survival following nerve-sparing radical cystoprostatectomy. From March 1982 through July 1988, 76 men underwent nerve-sparing radical cystoprostatectomy for carcinoma of the bladder at our hospital. Of the 76 patients 2 (2.6%) had positive surgical margins (dome of the bladder and left ureter) and neither had positive margins at the site of nerve-sparing modifications. Of 3 patients (3.9%) who had local recurrence none had positive surgical margins. The 5-year actuarial local recurrence rate is 7.5%. Thirteen of 76 patients (17%) died of transitional cell carcinoma and 7 (9%) died of other causes, while 53 (70%) are alive without evidence of disease with a mean followup of 38.4 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rates are 64% over-all, 68% without disease and 78% disease-specific. Of the 42 evaluable men who underwent cystoprostatectomy alone 27 (64%) are potent, compared to 2 of the 12 men (17%) who also underwent urethrectomy. We conclude that the nerve-sparing modifications do not compromise cancer control, that local recurrence and survival rates are at least comparable to those achieved with standard radical cystoprostatectomy, and that it is possible to preserve potency in most men undergoing this procedure.",316,1
"Effectiveness of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin combination chemotherapy in good-prognosis metastatic testicular nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. The combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (CEB) was evaluated as initial chemotherapy in 76 patients with good-prognosis metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) between 1984 and 1988. The classification of eligible patients included Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) stages IM, IIA, IIB, IIC, IIIA, IIIB, IV0ABCL1, and IV0ABL2. Four courses of combination chemotherapy were administered in a 21-day cycle, and surgical excision of residual mass was performed in 27 cases (23 laparotomies and four thoracotomies). At the time of analysis, median follow-up was 24 months from start of chemotherapy (range, 6 to 54 months). The 2-year cause-specific survival probability was 98.5%, the single cause-related mortality being caused by bleomycin pneumonitis. Five patients failed CEB chemotherapy, but all have been successfully salvaged with a combination of surgery and intensive chemotherapy, follow-up from completion of all treatment being 35 to 44 months. The toxicity of CEB included bone marrow suppression and alopecia in all patients but no significant neurotoxicity or ototoxicity, and minimal renal toxicity. Only four (5%) patients had a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate greater than 15%. In 51% of patients, the hemoglobin fell below 10 g/dL. The WBC count nadir was less than 1,500/microL in 11% of treatment cycles and in 16% the platelet nadir fell below 50,000/microL. Decreases in the WBC and platelet counts were of very brief duration. Only one of 310 CEB cycles was complicated by neutropenic sepsis, and there were no episodes of thrombocytopenic purpura or bleeding. We conclude that the CEB combination represents an effective alternative to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in good-prognosis NSGCT and that the replacement of cisplatin by carboplatin leads to reduced toxicity.",480,1
"Colonic polyamine content and ornithine decarboxylase activity as markers for adenomas. Polyamine content (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) or ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was measured in normal-appearing colonic mucosa from patients undergoing colonoscopy. Comparisons were made between those with and those without adenomatous polyps. Colonic mucosal polyamine content was measured in 44 persons. Mean putrescine content was 1.25 +/- 0.26 (SE) nmol/mg protein in 22 patients with adenomatous polyps compared with 0.53 +/- 0.12 nmol/mg protein in patients without polyps (P less than 0.02). Tissue content of spermidine and spermine did not differ between these two groups. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was measured in tissue from 45 patients. Mean ODC activity was 2.84 +/- 0.73 pmol/hr/mg protein in 23 persons with adenomatous polyps compared with 1.15 +/- 0.18 pmol/hr/mg protein in persons without polyps (P less than 0.05). Mucosal putrescine and ODC activity are elevated in patients with adenomatous polyps compared with patients without polyps. These biochemical markers may prove helpful in improving surveillance methods for colorectal cancer and premalignant adenomatous polyps.",297,0
"The relationship of nasopharyngeal carcinomas and second independent malignancies based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group experience. The authors sought to learn if the incidence of second independent malignancies after the irradiation of carcinomas of the nasopharynx is similar to that observed after treatment of tumors arising in other head and neck sites. One hundred twenty-one patients who had primary carcinomas of the nasopharynx who were treated solely by ionizing radiation (according to the specifications of a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol) were identified and their subsequent well-being was reviewed. Overall there was a 4.1% incidence of second malignancies (2% after 3 years, 5% after 5 years, and 8% after 8 years) with most arising in the upper aerodigestive tract. This rate is significantly less than the rate associated with other head and neck sites. It is not significantly different from the rate of first malignancies observed in an age-matched and sex-matched population. When only those patients who were free of all evidence of neoplastic disease 6 months after the completion of radiotherapy are considered, similar analysis leads to similar outcomes. The authors conclude that the risk of second malignancies after the successful irradiation of carcinomas of the nasopharynx is substantially less than after treatment of tumors at other head and neck sites.",270,1
"Impairment of cerebral autoregulation during the development of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in primates. We studied the impairment of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its effect on the electrical activity of the brain during the development of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, using a vasospasm model in primates. Fourteen animals were divided into two groups: a clot group (8) and a sham-operated group (6). To induce subarachnoid hemorrhage, all the animals underwent craniectomy, and in the clot group, the autologous blood clot was located around the arteries dissected free from the arachnoid membrane. Cerebral angiography was performed before subarachnoid hemorrhage and 7 days after (Day 7). On Day 7, regional CBF in the parietal lobe--measured by the hydrogen clearance method--and central conduction time were studied during either graded hypertension or hypotension. In the clot group, the mean vessel caliber of the cerebral arteries on the right side (clot side) of the circle of Willis showed significant (P less than 0.01) reduction (more than 40%) as compared with the values on the contralateral, non-clot side. The values for the bilateral parietal CBF in the sham-operated group and the left parietal CBF in the clot group were fairly constant when the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was in the range of 60 to 160 mm Hg. In the clot group, right parietal CBF was significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller than that on the left side at an MABP level of 40 to 100 mm Hg, and increased at an MABP level of 180 mm Hg. The right parietal CBF increased as the arterial blood pressure increased, showing impairment of autoregulation.",385,0
"A five-year U.S. Army experience with 36,250 abdominal hernia repairs. Thirty-six thousand two hundred fifty abdominal hernia repairs were performed in U.S. Army medical treatment facilities during a five-year period. This study presents data about the type of hernia, incidence of complications by obstruction or strangulation, age, sex, and mortality. Hernias occurring with intestinal obstruction or gangrene (strangulation) are referred to as complicated hernias. Inguinal hernias in children less than two years of age, femoral hernias, and unusual (such as internal or obturator) hernias were found to have an increased incidence of complications. Surgical repair of ventral, umbilical, and femoral hernias was done with a low surgical risk and the presence of complications did not significantly increase this risk. An increased risk of mortality is associated with the repair of complicated unusual hernias and complicated inguinal hernias in patients more than 60 years of age.",201,0
"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of crural arteries. The authors dilated 103 stenosed crural arteries in 71 patients. Primary success was defined as traversing and reducing the lesion to a residual stenosis of less than 30%. This was achieved in 96% of cases. Complications included one vessel rupture and one occluding intimal flap, which were treated by the vascular surgeon with bypass and venous patch, respectively. One hematoma at the puncture site was treated surgically because of its size. With modern materials such as steerable guide wires and low-profile balloon catheters, dilation of crural arteries has become safe. Until now, the indications for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of crural arteries have been limited to Fontaine stages III and IV disease. The authors believe that the indications for PTA in Fontaine stage IIb disease are justified, especially if intervention improves outflow after a more proximal recanalizing procedure is performed.",199,0
"Immunohistochemical demonstration of the placental form of glutathione S-transferase, a detoxifying enzyme in human gliomas. Expression of the human placental form of glutathion S-transferase (GST-pi) in human gliomas was investigated by immunohistochemical methods, and the result was compared with that of normal human glial cells. The gliomas in this study were composed of five benign astrocytomas (Grade 2), ten anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), and 16 glioblastomas (Grade 4). Normal human glial cells showed only a weak immunostaining response for GST-pi in the cytoplasm or some nuclear membranes. All of benign astrocytomas had diffusely weak GST-pi immunostaining, resembling that of normal glial cells. With increasing grade, gliomas showed a strongly positive reaction for GST-pi. The positive reactions were remarkable especially in the gemistocytes and giant cells in the high-grade gliomas. These results suggest that cells of gliomas have some detoxifying function and the expression of this detoxifying enzyme, GST-pi, is related to the degree of malignancy of the gliomas.",234,1
"The association of blood pressure levels and change in renal function in hypertensive and nonhypertensive subjects. We compared the changes in serum creatinine levels over time after a mean follow-up of 9.8 years in essential hypertensive (EH, n = 56) and control (n = 59) male veteran subjects. All subjects had normal serum creatinine levels (62 to 124 mumol/L) and ""normal"" urinalysis results on entry into the study. Subjects with comorbid renal diagnoses and diabetes mellitus were eliminated from the analysis. Although not statistically significant, the rate of change in the serum creatinine concentration over time was greater in the EH cohort compared with the control cohort (1.08 +/- 4.8 vs 0.027 +/- 3.5 mumol/L per year). The difference was especially marked in black EH subjects vs black control subjects (1.60 +/- 6.2 mumol/L per year vs -0.21 +/- 3.3 mumol/L per year). When age, race, body mass index, and a diagnosis of EH were entered into a logistic regression analysis, EH subjects had a statistically significantly greater rate of decline in renal function than did control subjects (1.5 +/- 8.3 mumol/L per year). When mean time-averaged systolic blood pressure for each subject was also included in the logistic regression analysis, only systolic time-averaged blood pressure was statistically significant (0.063 +/- 0.029 mumol/L per year). We conclude that in the absence of clinically detected parenchymal renal disease, EH subjects have a greater rate of decline in renal function than do nonhypertensive subjects. Time-averaged blood pressure is predictive of the change in serum creatinine concentration not only in EH subjects but also in nonhypertensive subjects. Thus, preservation of renal function may require a blood pressure lower than the currently accepted normotensive range.",406,0
"Diagnosis of metastatic lesions to the stomach by salvage cytology. A report of three cases. Secondary neoplasms of the stomach are rare and are often clinical and diagnostic problems. Three patients with bleeding ""volcano-like"" ulcers were diagnosed by combined endoscopic ""salvage"" cytology and surgical biopsy as having metastatic submucosal lesions from hematologic spread. The combination of endoscopic appearance, clinical findings, and tissue and cytologic examination can lead to the correct diagnosis. The results from these cases support the utility of this cytologic technique in combination with biopsy in this clinical setting. ",117,1
"Endoscopic placement of a Foley catheter across a stricture and rectovaginal fistula to perform a barium enema. Evaluation of enteric fistulas is often best performed with barium contrast studies. Clinical situations that preclude the satisfactory installation of barium decrease the yield of the study. A case is presented of a 59-yr-old female with stage III-B cervical carcinoma and a known rectovaginal fistula with an adjacent sigmoid colon stricture. An additional more proximal, enteric fistula was suspected. Definitive preoperative knowledge of the existence or absence of this fistula would have shortened the duration of a planned palliative intervention. The rectovaginal fistula and stricture precluded adequate barium and air installation for contrast study. Colonoscopy was unsuccessful. We have developed a combined technique in which the endoscopic placement of a semirigid guidewire allowed placement of a Foley catheter across the fistula and stricture. Successful barium study was performed. Intraoperative time and hospital stay were shortened.",195,1
"Scintigraphic assessment of leukocyte infiltration in acute pancreatitis using technetium-99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine as leukocyte label. The infiltration of leukocytes has been linked to the pathophysiology of complicated or severe pancreatitis. We have tested the ability of leukocyte scintigraphy using technetium-99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine (HM-PAO) as label to demonstrate the localization of leukocytes in the pancreas during acute pancreatitis. Twenty-eight patients with acute pancreatitis (eight with biliary, 13 with alcoholic, and seven with unknown origin) were studied with leukocyte scintigraphy using planar imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Fourteen patients had a mild (group I), II a severe (group II), and three a lethal outcome (group III) of pancreatitis. All patients of group III, six of group II, and two of group I had a positive leukocyte scan. Thus, the sensitivity of leukocyte scintigraphy for the detection of a lethal course of acute pancreatitis was 100%, of a severe course 54%, and of a severe or lethal course 64%. The specificity of a negative scan for a mild pancreatitis was 86%. Comparison of the results of leukocyte scintigraphy with those of contrast enhanced CT showed that six of eight patients with pancreatic necrosis in CT had a positive leukocyte scan, but only five of 20 patients without detectable pancreatic necrosis in CT. In summary, leukocyte infiltration into the pancreas during pancreatitis can be demonstrated by noninvasive leukocyte scintigraphy using technetium-99m-HM-PAO as label. A correlation between the severity of the disease and leukocyte infiltration exists.",359,0
"Appendectomy in primary and secondary staging operations for ovarian malignancy. Appendectomy was performed at primary or secondary staging operations in 100 patients with ovarian malignancies. Of 80 patients who underwent appendectomy at the time of their primary surgery, 25 (31.2%) had appendiceal metastases. Among 47 patients who were believed to have disease limited to the pelvis at the time of surgery--stage I (N = 34), II (N = 7), IIIA (N = 5), and those designated stage IIIC solely on the basis of microscopic para-aortic nodal metastasis (N = 1)--the appendix was involved with disease in only two patients (4.3%). However, among 33 patients with advanced disease--stage IIIB (N = 6), IIIC except those designated IIIC solely on the basis of microscopic paraaortic nodal metastasis (N = 19), and IV (N = 8)--the appendix was involved with disease in 23 patients (69.7%) (P less than .001). Poorly differentiated tumors and serous histologic cell types more frequently metastasized to the appendix (64, 15, 6, and 8% for grades 3, 2, and 1 and borderline histology, respectively; P less than .001; and 48, 13, and 8% for serous, endometrioid, and mucinous; P less than .001). Of 20 patients who underwent appendectomy at their secondary staging procedure, two had metastases. Metastatic disease in the appendix was microscopic in nine of 27 patients. Because the frequency of appendiceal metastasis is similar to that of other metastatic sites in stages I and II ovarian cancer, it should be removed at primary staging procedures. Appendectomy should also be performed in patients with advanced ovarian malignancies if it contributes to cytoreduction or at the time of secondary staging procedures.",423,1
"Patient-controlled analgesic administration. A comparison of steady-state morphine infusions with bolus doses. The authors have shown previously that bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients who self-administered bolus doses of morphine gained equal oral mucositis pain relief while using less drug compared with similar patients receiving morphine by staff-controlled continuous infusion. In a follow-up study they compared the efficacy and side effects of morphine in two groups of marrow transplant patients who controlled their own analgesic administration either by conventional bolus-dose, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or by adjusting the rate of continuous morphine infusion to increase or decrease their plasma morphine concentration. Patients controlling their morphine infusion rates (pharmacokinetically based patient-controlled analgesia [PKPCA] group) obtained more relief from oral mucositis pain than did patients using conventional PCA. Patients in the PKPCA group used more morphine than PCA patients and achieved superior pain relief without significant increases in side effects (e.g., nausea, mood changes, sedation). The authors conclude that PKPCA improves the management of prolonged, severe pain in marrow transplant patients and that this approach to patient-controlled analgesia may be useful in other types of persistent pain.

"Intravascular ultrasound: a new potential modality for angioplasty guidance. Current angioplasty devices are limited by significant rates of arterial perforation and dissection, due to inadequate techniques of guidance, and by restenosis, which may be partly attributed to inadequate debulking of lesions. This paper describes the authors' initial experience in-vitro and in-vivo with intravascular ultrasound as a possible method of enhancing the three-dimensional guidance of devices through atherosclerotic obstructions. Using an in-vitro model they correlated the dimensions and histologic morphology of animal and human arteries with ultrasound images of the specimens. Additional in-vivo evaluations of this technology in canine arteriosclerotic and human atherosclerotic arteries preliminarily support the hypothesis that intravascular ultrasound defines the transmural arterial morphology and may enhance the accuracy of angioplasty procedures. Simultaneous imaging with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound is demonstrated as a potential method of accurately defining both intraluminal and transmural arterial wall characteristics. ",202,0
"Rate-related left bundle branch block as a cause of non-ischemic chest pain. A case is presented of rate-dependent left bundle branch block associated with chest pain in a patient with angiographically normal coronary arteries.

"A study of the comparative efficacy of four common analgesics in the control of postsurgical dental pain. Four common oral analgesics were tested in a single-blind trial to determine their relative efficacy in the management of postsurgical pain in 103 patients who had their impacted third molars surgically removed under general anesthesia. The analgesics tested were acetylsalicylic acid (26 patients), ibuprofen (26 patients), a paracetamol/codeine/caffeine combination (Solpadeine) (25 patients), and dihydrocodeine (26 patients). The paracetamol/codeine/caffeine combination, ibuprofen, and acetylsalicylic acid preparations produced equally effective analgesia. Dihydrocodeine was found to be a poor analgesic in this pain model. There were no adverse reactions to any of the preparations.",168,0
"Pathological observations of intrahepatic peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers. III. Survey of necroinflammation and cystic dilatation. Pathological changes and significance of intrahepatic peribiliary glands, hitherto poorly recognized intrahepatic elements, have been evaluated in our laboratory. In this report, we surveyed necroinflammatory and cystic changes of the peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers because these two changes coexisted frequently in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was found in 228 livers (22.8%) and the cystic change in 202 livers (20.2%), and 103 cases showed both changes in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was frequently found in intrahepatic cholangitis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction with bacterial infection, suggesting that biliary bacterial inflammation extends into these peribilary glands. This change was also frequent in systemic infection or septicemia without biliary bacterial infection, implying that the peribiliary glands were also damaged in such conditions without direct infection. The cystic change was frequent in livers with portal hypertension or obstruction, adult polycystic disease and necroinflammation of the glands, suggesting that the cystic change of the glands could occur as the result of the disturbance of intrahepatic circulation or as the result of inflammatory destruction of the glandular conduits. Some of peribiliary cysts may be of congenital origin. Dysfunction related to these pathological changes in the glands may diminish seromucous secretion and cause alterations in hepatic bile composition. The cystic change of the glands may retard bile flow by compressing bile duct lumina.",331,0
"Cat-scratch disease: an unusual cause of combative behavior. Acute encephalitis is an unusual manifestation of cat-scratch disease. The authors present the case of a 27-year-old man who exhibited the acute onset of encephalitis manifested by violent behavior and confusion. The diagnosis of drug abuse was presumed initially, but a careful examination revealed the true cause to be cat-scratch disease. Emergency physicians are frequently faced with the challenging task of evaluating confused and combative patients. This case demonstrates the importance of a complete physical examination and a thorough laboratory evaluation.",112,0
"Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents: theory and application to the central nervous system. The theoretical aspects of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agents are reviewed, and their current applications to the central nervous system (CNS) and their future applications are discussed. Profound differences exist between contrast agents used for MR imaging and computerized tomography (CT). In MR imaging, the contrast agents are not imaged directly but rather act on adjacent protons to shorten T1 and T2 relaxation times. This in turn results in signal intensity changes. The lanthanide metal, gadolinium, in the form of gadopentetate dimeglumine, has been found to be both safe and efficacious as the only currently approved contrast agent for MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging revolutionized the detection and treatment of disease affecting the brain and spine. Initially, it was thought that signal characteristics on MR imaging would allow differentiation of specific pathology. It was soon found that MR studies were able to detect more abnormalities but were less able to characterize them. The recent development of contrast agents for MR imaging has allowed this modality to surpass CT for the evaluation of most CNS lesions. At present, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is generally accepted as the study of choice for evaluating acoustic neurinomas, pituitary lesions, meningeal disease, primary and secondary brain tumors, active multiple sclerosis, intradural spinal neoplasms, intramedullary spinal disease, and postoperative states in both the spine and brain. Even when contrast-enhanced CT can detect the same abnormalities, evaluation of the lesions in multiple planes on MR imaging can sometimes yield invaluable information, especially prior to surgery. Future developments of contrast material for MR imaging include non-gadolinium compounds, intrathecal contrast media, cerebral blood flow and volume evaluation, and, possibly, antibody-labeled contrast agents.",362,1
"Visceral protothecosis mimicking sclerosing cholangitis in an immunocompetent host: successful antifungal therapy. A healthy 39-year-old man who had clinical findings consistent with sclerosing cholangitis was found to have systemic protothecosis at surgery. Severe granulomatous inflammation and palpable nodules were found in the gallbladder, on the surface of the liver, and in the duodenum. Prototheca wickerhamii was detected in biopsied specimens and stool; the titer of indirect fluorescent antibody to this organism was 1:2,000. The patient recovered after a short course of treatment with amphotericin B and 3 months of oral therapy with ketoconazole. He had no other concurrent illness and had no abnormality in his immune system. This is the second reported human case of systemic protothecosis. An elevated IgG level, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, eosinophilia, and abnormal levels of enzymes in the liver were found in both cases. Protothecosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hepatic and biliary inflammatory diseases of uncertain etiology.",220,0
"New findings in treatment of colon cancer. Patients with colon cancer involving regional lymph nodes (stage C disease) have a 5-year survival rate of only 30% to 40%, and the majority die of recurrent disease. Recent trials have shown increased survival rates with postoperative use of fluorouracil plus levamisole. The authors discuss these findings and the implications on treatment recommendations for stage C colon cancer.",85,1
"Hybridization protection assay: a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for detection of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias. The Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome is present in greater than 90% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and in 2% to 20% of those with acute leukemias, for which it is an important prognostic marker too. The chimeric BCR-ABL mRNAs resulting from the translocation encode either a 210-Kd or a 190-Kd protein. The techniques used to detect Ph1 chromosome include karyotyping, Southern analysis to demonstrate bcr rearrangement, and polymerase chain reaction to amplify the BCR-ABL transcripts. However, the routine performance of these methods by clinical laboratories is cumbersome, time consuming, and exposes laboratory personnel to radioisotopes. We describe here the clinical application of a new method, the hybridization protection assay (HPA), which uses chemiluminescent acridinium-ester-labeled probes in conjunction with PCR for detection of the amplified BCR-ABL sequences. The method is sensitive, specific, and can reliably distinguish between the transcripts for P190BCR-ABL and P210BCR-ABL. In contrast to the 2 days or longer required for conventional hybridization, HPA analysis can be completed in less than 30 minutes. We have successfully used this method to analyze 60 leukemia samples (34 from Ph1-negative acute leukemias; 6 from Ph1-positive acute leukemias; and 20 from CML) with complete correlation (of BCR-ABL positivity or negativity) with the results of karyotype or Southern Blot analysis of genomic DNA for bcr rearrangement. Therefore, the HPA, in conjunction with PCR, appears to provide a rapid and reliable test for the diagnosis of Ph1-positivity.",382,1
"Oral contraceptives and breast cancer. Among women in general the risk of breast cancer through 59 years of age does not appear to be affected appreciably by the use of oral contraceptives. Nonetheless, concern continues to be expressed about the effects of early age at first use, long-term duration of use, formulation, and a variety of other factors thought to influence breast cancer risk in the presence of oral contraception. A number of recent studies restricted to young women suggest that long-term use may increase the risk of disease occurring very early, but the present lack of consistent findings in well-conducted epidemiologic studies prevents any certain conclusion with regard to cause-and-effect. However, if an increased risk were indeed present, the most plausible interpretation is that long-term oral contraception promotes earlier clinical manifestation of breast cancer in some women while having no net impact on their lifetime risk of the disease.",178,1
"A controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir in neonatal herpes simplex virus infection. Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group. BACKGROUND. Despite the use of vidarabine, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in neonates continues to be a disease of high morbidity and mortality. We undertook a controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. METHODS. Babies less than one month of age with virologically confirmed HSV infection were randomly and blindly assigned to receive either intravenous vidarabine (30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day; n = 95) or acyclovir (30 mg per kilogram per day; n = 107) for 10 days. Actuarial rates of mortality and morbidity among the survivors after one year were compared overall and according to the extent of the disease at entry into the study (infection confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated disease). RESULTS. After adjustment for differences between groups in the extent of disease, there was no difference between vidarabine and acyclovir in either morbidity (P = 0.83) or mortality (P = 0.27). None of the 85 babies with disease confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth died. Of the 31 babies in this group who were treated with vidarabine and followed for a year, 88 percent (22 of 25) were judged to be developing normally after one year, as compared with 98 percent (45 of 46) of the 54 treated with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -4 to 24). For the 71 babies with encephalitis, mortality was 14 percent with vidarabine (5 of 36) and with acyclovir (5 of 35); of the survivors, 43 percent (13 of 30) and 29 percent (8 of 28), respectively, were developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -11 to 39). For the 46 babies with disseminated disease, mortality was 50 percent (14 of 28) with vidarabine and 61 percent (11 of 18) with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -20 to 40); of the survivors, 58 percent (7 of 12) and 60 percent (3 of 5), respectively, were judged to be developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -40 to 50). Both medications were without serious toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS. In this multicenter, randomized, blinded study there were no differences in outcome between vidarabine and acyclovir in the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. The study lacked statistical power to determine whether there were sizable differences within the subgroups of those with localized HSV, encephalitis, or disseminated disease.",631,0
"Evolution of energy expenditure and nitrogen excretion in severe head-injured patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of therapeutic changes on the level of energy expenditure (EE) and N excretion in a homogeneous group of patients usually considered hypermetabolic. DESIGN: EE and N excretion of head-injured patients were measured simultaneously at phases 1 and 2 (patients treated 4 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 8 days after injury, respectively). SETTING: Acute care hospital. PATIENTS: Eight severe head-injured patients, mean weight 63.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) kg, mean age 21 +/- 3.8 (SD) yr. INTERVENTIONS: At phase 1, all patients were sedated with fentanyl (6.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/kg.hr) plus flunitrazepam (9.1 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg.hr) and were mechanically ventilated. All patients received continuous total parenteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1092 +/- 200 kcal/day, including 77% glucose and 23% fat (Intralipid 20%). The total N intake averaged 7 +/- 5 g/day, consisting of crystalline amino acids. At phase 2, no patient received any sedative and all were breathing spontaneously via tracheostomy. All patients received parenteral and/or enteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1929 +/- 200 kcal/day consisting of 65% carbohydrates and 35% fat. The total N intake averaged 13 +/- 2 g/day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The EE was significantly higher at phase 2 than at phase 1 (2121 vs. 1737 kcal), but the interindividual variability was low at both phases. N excretion was high at the two periods of the study and not correlated to the level of EE. The RQ was 0.75 at both periods, indicating predominant fat oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any parallelism in the evolution of EE and protein catabolism in head-injured patients. The therapeutics (mechanical ventilation, sedation, and nutrition) have a major effect on EE but little on N excretion.",480,0
"Ultrastructural study of Norrie's disease. We studied the clinicopathologic and ultrastructural features of a full-term infant with Norrie's disease. The infant had bilateral retrolental fibrous vascular masses and retinal detachment with no other apparent physical abnormalities and no family history of ocular defects. A vitrectomy and a membrane peeling were attempted, and specimens of the retina, the retrolental membrane, and a vascularized epiretinal peripheral mass were examined by light and electron microscopy. The retrolental membrane was composed of layered collagenous tissue and contained structures resembling blood vessels. Inner and outer neuroblastic layers were identified in the retinal tissue, but no vessels were present. In the epiretinal mass, portions of retina and cortical vitreous were seen along with primitive vascular structures. The histologic appearance of these specimens suggests that the major pathologic event of Norrie's disease occurs in the retina in the third to fourth gestational month. We believe the subsequent ocular abnormalities found in this patient were secondary to this early retinal malformation and did not represent a progressive ocular disorder. ",220,0
"Atrial activation sequence during atrial flutter in the canine pericarditis model and its effects on the polarity of the flutter wave in the electrocardiogram. Stable atrial flutter induced in both conscious and open chest states was studied in 30 mongrel dogs after production of sterile pericarditis. During the conscious state studies, induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 128 +/- 15 ms) was always sustained greater than 15 min and was stable. Three types of flutter wave polarity were noted in electrocardiogram (ECG) lead II: positive in 16 dogs, negative in 3 and flat or slightly positive in 11. Sequential site atrial mapping during atrial flutter (mean cycle length 133 +/- 18 ms) in the open chest state showed either clockwise (18 dogs) or counterclockwise (12 dogs) circus movement in the right atrium. In 19 of 30 dogs, the circus movement clearly did not require any naturally existing anatomic obstacle; in 11, the orifice of the superior vena cava probably was also involved. Double potentials were recorded from the center of the reentrant circuit during atrial flutter, and fractionated electrograms were recorded from a pivot point of the reentrant wave front. A positive flutter wave in ECG lead II (12 dogs with counterclockwise circus movement) was associated with early activation of the Bachmann's bundle region compared with the posteroinferior left atrium and activation of the left atrium mainly in a superoinferior direction. A negative flutter was associated with the early activation of the posteroinferior left atrium compared with Bachmann's bundle and activation of a considerable portion of the left atrium in an inferosuperior direction. A flat or slightly positive flutter wave (14 of 18 with clockwise circus movement) was associated with activation of the left atrium almost simultaneously by two wave fronts coming from both these sites. In conclusion, atrial flutter in this dog model is due to circus movement in the right atrium, the center of which does not necessarily require an anatomic obstacle. Although atrial flutter is generated by circus movement in the right atrium, the flutter wave polarity in the ECG is determined primarily by the activation sequence of the left atrium.",454,0
"Modulation of coronary vasomotor tone in humans. Progressive endothelial dysfunction with different early stages of coronary atherosclerosis. The endothelium plays a critical role in the control of vasomotor tone by the release of vasoactive substances. Because endothelial injury or dysfunction is considered important very early in atherogenesis, we hypothesized that abnormal endothelial function precedes the angiographic detection of coronary atherosclerosis in the human coronary circulation. The coronary vasomotor responses to three different endothelium-mediated stimuli (intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, increase in blood flow to induce flow-dependent dilation, and sympathetic stimulation by cold pressor testing) were assessed by quantitative angiography and subselective intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements within the left anterior descending coronary artery in 38 patients. All three stimuli elicited epicardial artery dilation in all 11 patients with smooth coronary arteries and absence of risk factors for coronary artery disease (group 1). All nine patients with smooth coronary arteries but with hypercholesterolemia (group 2) demonstrated a selective impairment in endothelial function with vasoconstriction (35 +/- 12.7% decrease in mean luminal area) in response to acetylcholine but showed a preserved flow-dependent dilation (15.5 +/- 4.4% increase in mean luminal area) and vasodilation in response to cold pressor testing (14.2 +/- 4.6% increase in mean luminal area). In all nine patients with an angiographically defined smooth coronary artery segment but with evidence of atherosclerosis elsewhere in the coronary system (group 3), both acetylcholine and cold pressor testing induced vasoconstriction (26.2 +/- 8.7% and 18.7 +/- 7.9% decrease in mean luminal area, respectively), whereas flow-dependent dilation was preserved (20.4 +/- 8.7% increase in mean luminal area). In the nine patients with angiographic evidence of wall irregularities (group 4), flow-dependent dilation was also abolished and vasoconstriction occurred in response to acetylcholine and cold pressor testing (34.5 +/- 10.7% and 19.9 +/- 6.3% decrease in mean luminal area, respectively). All coronary artery segments dilated in response to nitroglycerin, suggesting preserved function of vascular smooth muscle. Despite similar reductions in coronary vascular resistance in response to the smooth muscle relaxant papaverin, patients with hypercholesterolemia demonstrated a selective impairment of vasodilation of the resistance vasculature in response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.05 versus groups 1, 3, and 4). Thus, there is a progressive impairment of endothelial vasoactive functioning in coronary arteries of patients with different early stages of atherosclerosis, beginning with a selective endothelial dysfunction in angiographically defined normal arteries in patients with hypercholesterolemia and progressively worsening to a complete loss of endothelium-mediated vasodilation in angiographically defined atherosclerotic coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",635,0
"The elusive colonic malignancy. A need for definitive preoperative localization. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the standard of practice for the diagnosis of colonic malignancies. Unfortunately, the inability of endoscopy to obtain precise distance measurements from the anal verge can make localization of lesions at operation difficult. For this reason, preoperative barium enema or intraoperative colonoscopy have been advocated to further pinpoint the sites of those lesions not thought to be easily located at operation. Five patients are presented in whom malignant lesions of the colon were diagnosed and verified histologically, but were later undetectable at operation or subsequent colonoscopic examinations. Four of these patients underwent laparotomy and three received colon resections. None of these patients' tumors were identified during intraoperative colonoscopy, in the resected bowel on pathologic examination, or on follow-up colonoscopy. A fifth patient is presented who spontaneously passed a polyp containing invasive adenocarcinoma, but multiple colonoscopic examinations have failed to identify the site of the lesion. To date, none of these tumors have recurred with periods of follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years. These patients demonstrate a poorly documented and little understood aspect of the behavior of colonic malignancies, i.e., the ability to spontaneously regress or slough from the bowel wall. Based on these instances, localization of potentially malignant colon lesions is recommended with submucosal dye injections at initial endoscopy or with colonoscopy in the operating room immediately prior to operation.",294,1
"Regional cardiac adrenergic function using I-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine tomographic imaging after acute myocardial infarction. The effect of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on regional cardiac adrenergic function was studied in 27 patients mean +/- standard deviation 10 +/- 4 days after AMI. Regional adrenergic function was evaluated noninvasively with I-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) using a dedicated 3-detector tomograph. Four hours after its administration, there was reduced MIBG uptake in the region of infarction, 0.38 +/- 0.31 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 compared with 0.60 +/- 0.30 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 and 0.92 +/- 0.35 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 in the zones bordering and distant from the infarct area, respectively, p less than 0.001. In all patients, the area of reduced MIBG uptake after 4 hours was more extensive that the associated thallium-201 perfusion defect with defect scores of 52 +/- 22 and 23 +/- 18%, respectively, p less than 0.001. After anterior wall AMI, the 4-hour MIBG defect score was 70 +/- 13% and the degree of mismatch between myocardial perfusion and MIBG uptake was 30 +/- 9% compared with 39 +/- 17 and 21 +/- 17% after inferior AMI, p less than 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively. The 4-hour MIBG defect score correlated inversely with the predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction, r = -0.73, p less than 0.001. Patients with ventricular arrhythmia of greater than or equal to 1 ventricular premature complexes per hour, paired ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia detected during the late hospital phase had higher 4-hour MIBG defect scores, 62.5 +/- 15.0%, than patients with no detectable complex ventricular ectopic activity and a ventricular premature complex frequency of less than 1 per hour, 44.6 +/- 23.4%, p = 0.036.",496,0
"Tumor necrosis factor regulates the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 receptors on human acute myeloid leukemia cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) acts as a potent enhancer of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- and interleukin-3 (IL-3)-induced human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) growth in vitro. We have analyzed the effects of TNF alpha on the expression of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors on AML cells. Incubation of blasts from seven patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/mL) and subsequent binding studies using 125I-GM-CSF and 125I-IL-3 show that TNF increases the specific binding of GM-CSF (30% to 280%) and IL-3 (40% to 600%) in all cases. From Scatchard plot analysis it appears that TNF upregulates (1) low-affinity GM-CSF binding sites, (2) common high-affinity IL-3/GM-CSF binding sites, and (3) unique (non-GM-CSF binding) IL-3 binding sites. The effect of TNF is dose dependent and is half maximal at a concentration of 100 U/mL, and becomes evident at 18 hours of incubation with TNF at 37 degrees C, but not at 0 degree C. The GM-CSF dose-response curve of AML-colony-forming units plateaus at a higher level in the presence of TNF, which indicates that additional numbers of cells become responsive to GM-CSF. Incubation of AML blasts with the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (protein kinase C activators) does not influence GM-CSF receptor expression, suggesting that receptor upregulation by TNF is not mediated through activation of protein kinase C. On the other hand, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide abrogates receptor upregulation induced by TNF. In contrast to these findings in AML, TNF does not upregulate GM-CSF receptor numbers on blood granulocytes or monocytes. We conclude that TNF exerts positive effects on growth factor receptor expression of hematopoietic cells.",480,1
"A self-assembling protein kinase C inhibitor. Previous studies have described a dicationic anticarcinoma agent that can chemically assemble in situ from monocationic phosphonium salts. The chemical combination of these monocationic precursors in the micromolar concentration range, occurring after their uptake by cells, was probably responsible for their synergistic inhibition of cell growth and for their selective cytotoxicity to Ehrlich ascites murine carcinoma cells relative to untransformed epithelial cells. Here, we report that the dicationic product that forms in this assembly reaction is an in vitro inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and beta 1 isoforms, exhibiting IC50 values of 20.4 microM and 35 microM, respectively. The monocationic precursors proved to be much weaker inhibitors of PKC (IC50 values greater than 200 microM). When PKC is exposed to combinations of the two precursors, the enzymatic activity decreases steadily as a function of time. Using dose-response data and HPLC kinetic studies, we show that when the two precursor compounds are added as a combination to PKC under these conditions, the rate of formation of the inhibitory product follows the observed time course of decline in PKC activity under identical conditions. We discuss the possibility that antiproliferative effects against carcinoma cells of the preformed dication and of the combined monocationic precursors involve inhibition of PKC.",284,1
"Association of hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody with acquisition and manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. We examined the associations between seropositivity for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the presence or development of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and with HIV-1 induced T-helper lymphocyte deficiency or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Serologic data on HBV and HIV-1, cytometric enumeration of CD4+ lymphocytes, clinical events (AIDS by Centers for Disease Control criteria) and hepatitis B vaccination histories were available on 4,498 homosexual participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, Men were classified as to previous infection with HBV and prevalent or incident infection with HIV-1. Although there was an association between seropositivity for HBV infection and HIV-1 infection at enrollment (odds ratios anti-HBc 2.6; HBsAg 4.2), the relation between HBV seropositivity and subsequent seroconversion to HIV-1 was weaker (odds ratios 1.3 and 1.6). HIV-1 seroconversion was also associated with a history of certain other sexually transmitted diseases, but predisposing sexual practices did not account for the association between HBV and HIV-1 infection. Seropositivity for HBV infection at entry was not related to initially low or more rapid subsequent decline in T-helper lymphocyte counts and was not associated with an increased incidence of AIDS during 2.5 years of follow-up. History of vaccination against HBV did not appear to decrease susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or to subsequent progression of immunodeficiency. We conclude that prior HBV infection is unlikely to be specifically associated with acquisition of HIV-1 infection and is unrelated to more rapid progression of HIV-1-induced immunodeficiency.",366,0

"Prognostic determinants in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure in newborns. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is becoming an accepted therapeutic modality for newborn respiratory failure, but there is little information available regarding the prognostic determinants with this technique. One hundred thirty-five newborns treated with ECMO over a 4-year period were critically analyzed with regard to the influence that birth weight, gestational age, age at initiation of ECMO, best blood gases before ECMO, number of hours on ECMO, renal failure, intracerebral hemorrhage, and long-distance air transport had on survival. Infants with meconium aspiration and those undergoing long-distance transfer showed significant differences in blood gases before ECMO, with survivors having more normal pH and carbon dioxide tension values. Intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure that developed during ECMO were grave prognostic signs, with few survivors in either group. These data show that ability to ventilate patients before ECMO, giving normal carbon dioxide tension and pH values, is an important prognostic sign in infants with meconium aspiration and undergoing long-distance transfer for ECMO, whereas renal failure and intracerebral hemorrhage are usually lethal complications of ECMO. Each center performing ECMO should continually reevaluate this invasive technique and its results and complications.",258,0

"Persistence and remission of depressive symptoms in late life. OBJECTIVE: The relation of poor health to the onset of depression symptoms in late life is well recognized, but little attention has been given to characteristics that might predict persistence or remission of depressive symptoms. In previous analyses the authors found that increasing disability and declining health preceded the emergence of depressive symptoms in older community residents and accounted for 70% of the variance explained by discriminant analyses. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the relevance of changes in health and disability to the persistence of depressive symptoms. METHOD: A representative sample of 1,855 adults aged 65 or older were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at baseline. Twenty-four months later, 1,577 individuals were available for a second assessment of depressive symptoms. The characteristics of the 97 community residents whose depressive symptoms persisted over 24 months were compared to those of the 114 whose symptoms remitted. RESULTS: Changes in health, differences in age, sleep disturbance, and added formal support services accounted for more than 30% of the variance between the persistently depressed and remission groups. Advanced age and worsening health were associated with persistent symptoms, improved health with remission. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have indicated that untoward changes in health and disability play a major role in the onset of depressive symptoms. These findings show a substantial contribution to chronicity as well.",288,0
"Race, nutritional status, and survival from breast cancer. The effects of nutritional status on differences in the survival of black and white women with breast cancer were studied in a cohort of 1,960 Georgia women diagnosed during 1975-1979. After data were adjusted for stage of disease, socioeconomic status, and other prognostic factors, poorer survival rates were shown in black women. Within each stage classification, lower levels of serum albumin and hemoglobin and higher relative body weight were more common among blacks and were independently associated with poorer survival. Among women with stage 3 disease, adjustment for these variables substantially reduced the excess mortality rate among blacks, suggesting that racial differences in survival may be partly explained by differences in nutritional status or extent of disease within stage.",156,1
"Linkage of early-onset familial breast cancer to chromosome 17q21. Human breast cancer is usually caused by genetic alterations of somatic cells of the breast, but occasionally, susceptibility to the disease is inherited. Mapping the genes responsible for inherited breast cancer may also allow the identification of early lesions that are critical for the development of breast cancer in the general population. Chromosome 17q21 appears to be the locale of a gene for inherited susceptibility to breast cancer in families with early-onset disease. Genetic analysis yields a lod score (logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage) of 5.98 for linkage of breast cancer susceptibility to D17S74 in early-onset families and negative lod scores in families with late-onset disease. Likelihood ratios in favor of linkage heterogeneity among families ranged between 2000:1 and greater than 10(6):1 on the basis of multipoint analysis of four loci in the region.",199,1
"Deficient counterregulatory hormone responses during hypoglycemia in a patient with insulinoma. Counterregulatory hormone responses were evaluated in a 37-yr-old woman before and after removal of a benign insulin-producing islet cell tumor. Counterregulatory hormone concentrations were measured during a glucose clamp with graded reductions of plasma glucose from 5.2 to 2.6 mmol/L. In the study before surgery, the increase in plasma epinephrine concentration was markedly blunted (by greater than 90%) compared to that in the study after surgery. The peak plasma norepinephrine concentration was similarly reduced by 71%, and plasma cortisol by 63%. In addition, the glycemic thresholds for secretion of the counterregulatory hormones were lower before removal of the tumor. Peak plasma GH responses were equivalent before and after surgery, but the threshold for GH secretion was 21% lower in the first hypoglycemia study. We conclude 1) that there is evidence for abnormal glucose counterregulatory hormone secretion in this patient, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypoglycemia seen in patients with insulinoma; 2) the reversal of reduced counterregulatory hormone secretion after tumor resection suggests that these defective hormonal responses may be related to recurrent hypoglycemia, persistent hyperinsulinemia, or both; and 3) that abnormal glucose counterregulation may exist in the absence of type 1 diabetes.",282,1
"Ki-67 immunostaining in uveal melanoma. The effect of pre-enucleation radiotherapy. The reactivity of 33 choroidal and ciliary body melanomas with monoclonal antibody Ki-67, which recognizes a proliferation associated nuclear antigen, has been assessed and compared with clinicopathologic parameters. In 23 cases, 8 Gy irradiation was given 2 days before enucleation. Nonirradiated melanomas had a significantly higher proliferation rate as defined by staining with monoclonal antibody Ki-67 as compared with irradiated tumors (P = 0.007). Similarly, a strong relationship was found between pre-enucleation irradiation and low mitotic activity (P = 0.001). There was no significant correlation between the presence of Ki-67-positive nuclei and histologic classification, largest tumor diameter, localization of the tumor, age, sex, scleral invasion, pigmentation, and lymphocytic infiltration. The relevance of Ki-67 immunohistochemistry for the assessment of the life prognosis of patients with uveal melanoma has to be studied prospectively.",223,1
"Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of treatment. In 58 breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) pretreatment characteristics, clinical course, and response to treatment were evaluated. Forty-four patients were uniformly treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Fourteen patients did not receive intraventricular treatment. In the intraventricularly treated group the median survival was 12 weeks. Multivariate analysis of the pretreatment characteristics of the intraventricularly treated patients demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to survival for age older than 55 years, lung metastases, cranial nerve involvement, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose less than 2.5 mmol/l, and CSF protein 0.51 to 1.0 g/l. Based on the significance of these predicting factors a prognostic index (PI) identified four groups of patients with a median survival of 43 weeks, 22 weeks, 11 weeks, and 3 weeks, respectively. After 6 weeks of intraventricular treatment 22 patients showed a neurologic improvement or stabilization, and nine patients showed a worsening of the neurologic signs, whereas 13 patients (30%) had already died. The responders had a median additional survival of 5 months versus 1 month for nonresponders. No relation was found between survival and intensity of the intraventricular treatment after the first 6 weeks of treatment. Almost all long survivors had also received systemic treatment for systemic disease, whereas most patients who died within 6 months did not receive systemic therapy. Radiation therapy had no influence on the survival time. Early death due to the intensive treatment occurred in three patients. In 11 of the 17 patients who survived more than 4 months an often seriously debilitating late neurotoxicity developed. The survival curve of the nonintraventricularly treated patients appeared to be essentially the same as the curve of the intraventricularly treated patients. Using the same PI the predicted survival time was also the same as in the intraventricularly treated group. It is concluded that survival in MC from breast carcinoma may be more dependent on some pretreatment characteristics than on treatment intensity. On the basis of these pretreatment characteristics the survival time seems to be predictable. Finally, late neurotoxicity due to aggressive treatment leads to impairment of the quality of life in more than 50% of the long survivors. The exact value of intraventricular and systemic therapy in patients with MC still has to be determined.",501,1
"Rhodopsin mutants that bind but fail to activate transducin. Rhodopsin is a member of a family of receptors that contain seven transmembrane helices and are coupled to G proteins. The nature of the interactions between rhodopsin mutants and the G protein, transduction (Gt), was investigated by flash photolysis in order to monitor directly Gt binding and dissociation. Three mutant opsins with alterations in their cytoplasmic loops bound 11-cis-retinal to yield pigments with native rhodopsin absorption spectra, but they failed to stimulate the guanosine triphosphatase activity of Gt. The opsin mutations included reversal of a charged pair conserved in all G protein-coupled receptors at the cytoplasmic border of the third transmembrane helix (mutant CD1), replacement of 13 amino acids in the second cytoplasmic loop (mutant CD2), and deletion of 13 amino acids from the third cytoplasmic loop (mutant EF1). Whereas mutant CD1 failed to bind Gt, mutants CD2 and EF1 showed normal Gt binding but failed to release Gt in the presence of guanosine triphosphate. Therefore, it appears that at least the second and third cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin are required for activation of bound Gt.",247,0
"An increase in plasma cholesterol independent of thyroid function during long-term amiodarone therapy. A dose-dependent relationship. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether long-term amiodarone treatment is associated with a rise in plasma cholesterol, and, if so, to analyze its relation with thyroid function. DESIGN: Consecutive entry trial, including cardiac patients who initiated amiodarone medication but excluding those with abnormal thyroid function (defined as peak thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH] less than 2.8 or greater than 22.0 mU/L) either before or during amiodarone treatment. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients who remained euthyroid were studied. INTERVENTION: Oral administration of amiodarone (mean duration of treatment, 17 months; range, 6 to 30 months). MEASUREMENTS: Fasting plasma lipids, thyroid hormones, and peak TSH to TRH values were recorded before and every 6 months during amiodarone treatment. RESULTS: Plasma cholesterol gradually increased from 5.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/L before treatment to 6.9 +/- 0.8 mmol/L after 30 months of amiodarone medication (P less than 0.001); the peak TSH response to TRH did not change. When age- and sex-specific reference values were applied, 30% of the patients had cholesterol values above the 75th percentile before treatment; this number rose to 69% after 2 years of treatment. The rise in plasma cholesterol was associated with an equal increase in apoprotein B. Plasma cholesterol was not related to the daily dose of amiodarone or to plasma concentrations of amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), or reverse triiodothyronine (rT3). Linear regression analysis indicated a positive relation between plasma cholesterol and the cumulative dose of amiodarone (r = 0.25, P less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: Long-term amiodarone treatment is associated with a dose-dependent increase in plasma cholesterol that is independent of thyroid function.",474,0
"Local control of auricular, periauricular, and external canal cutaneous malignancies with Mohs surgery. Three hundred ninety-seven patients with 407 cutaneous malignancies of the auricle, periauricular region, and cartilaginous external ear canal were reviewed. Tumors were most commonly located in the preauricular and postauricular regions, followed by the helix, concha, antihelix, and ear canal. All lesions were excised with Mohs microscopic control of margins. For lesions requiring lateral temporal bone resection, an adaptation of fresh-tissue microscopic control was used to analyze deep and anterior margins suspected of harboring residual tumor. Two-year minimum follow-up of 229 patients with periauricular and auricular tumors (N = 231 tumors) and 14 patients with cartilaginous ear canal tumors (N = 14 tumors) revealed recurrence rates of 6.9% and 14.3%, respectively. Recurrences were most common in cases of large tumors (greater than 2.5 cm), basal cell carcinomas with morphea elements, and multiply recurrent lesions. We conclude that Mohs surgery is comparatively effective, though not uniformly curative, and can be adapted to supplement excision of large tumors in these regions.",256,1
"Increasing the yield of ventricular tachycardia induction: a prospective, randomized comparative study of the standard ventricular stimulation protocol to a short-to-long protocol and a new two-site protocol. Programmed ventricular stimulation with a standard protocol that used up to three extrastimuli was compared prospectively with a short-to-long protocol and a two-site protocol in 77 consecutive patients undergoing electrophysiologic study in an attempt to increase the yield of ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction. The short-to-long protocol uses a train of eight stimuli at a short cycle length and up to two extrastimuli. The two-site protocol is similar to the standard protocol but delivers the last extrastimulus via a second spatially separated right ventricular catheter. Patients were divided into two groups based on indications for study: group 1 included 45 patients with syncope, nonsustained VT, or both, and group 2 included 32 patients with a history of sustained VT, sudden cardiac death, or both. The yield of VT induction with the short-to-long protocol was less than that with the standard protocol. In none of the patients in group 1 in whom the standard protocol results were negative did the short-to-long protocol produce sustained VT. Only two patients, both in group 2, had sustained arrhythmias induced by the short-to-long protocol when the standard protocol results were negative: one had sustained VT induced and one with long QT syndrome had ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced with the short-to-long protocol. However, the short-to-long protocol failed to induce sustained VT in seven patients in whom the standard protocol produced sustained VT. All seven of these patients required three extrastimuli with the standard protocol for induction of VT.",358,0
"Significance of discordant ST alternans in ventricular fibrillation. With the use of epicardial mapping, we investigated the electrical alternans of the ST segment during acute myocardial ischemia and studied the difference in ST alternans between dogs with resultant ventricular fibrillation and those without it. During the 7-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery below its first diagonal branch, 60 epicardial unipolar electrograms were recorded simultaneously at 1-minute intervals by a computerized mapping system. ST alternans was found in the eight dogs we observed. The amplitude of ST alternans (difference in the ST segment elevation of two consecutive electrograms) was greater in dogs with ventricular fibrillation (n = 4) than in those without it (n = 4) (3.92 +/- 1.24 versus 0.58 +/- 0.49 mV, p less than 0.05). Three of the four dogs with ventricular fibrillation demonstrated discordant ST alternans (i.e., adjacent leads were out of phase). Results from the present study indicate that an increased amplitude and discordance of ST alternans during acute myocardial ischemia are related to ventricular fibrillation and act as indicators of time and spatial unevenness of ventricular repolarization.",256,0
"Impaired polymorphonuclear leucocyte function in patients undergoing hepatectomy: adenylate energy charge and superoxide anion production in relation to hepatic mitochondrial redox state. Patients undergoing hepatectomy have an increased susceptibility to infection. We therefore studied the energy metabolism of the polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN), focusing on energy charge and function, especially superoxide anion (O2-) generation, in relation to the hepatic mitochondrial redox state. By labelling the PMN adenine nucleotide pool with radioactive adenine and by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c, the energy charge and O2- production was measured in 18 patients with hepatoma (non-cirrhotic, seven; cirrhotic, 11) undergoing hepatectomy. Their arterial ketone body ratios (KBRs), reflecting the hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, were above 0.7 before operation. After surgery, the 18 patients were divided into two groups: group A, KBR greater than 0.7, n = 10; and group B, KBR less than 0.7, n = 8. The energy charge and O2- release in group B decreased significantly from preoperative values (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01 respectively) and when compared with group A (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 respectively). These results suggest that impaired hepatic energy metabolism (KBR less than 0.7) in hepatectomized patients leads to impaired energy charge and O2- production in the PMNs.",337,1
"Necrotizing tracheobronchitis: complication of mechanical ventilation in an adult. A 51-year-old woman had localized interstitial pneumonia that rapidly progressed to involve all lung fields. After 9 days of conventional mechanical ventilation, pneumothorax developed in the presence of an obstruction of the right main bronchus. Bronchoscopy and endobronchial biopsies revealed NTB involving the tracheobronchial tree distal to the tip of the endotracheal tube, with complete obstruction of the right main bronchus by hard, eschar-like material. Tracheal mucosa proximal to the tip of the endotracheal tube was normal. Subsequent bronchoscopy, 20 days later, showed marked resolution of NTB. Though a frequent complication of mechanical ventilation in the neonate, NTB as a complication of conventional mechanical ventilation has not previously been recognized in an adult. Necrotizing tracheobronchitis should be suspected in adults who have had mechanical ventilation and who are experiencing ventilatory difficulties, after routine problems have been treated or excluded.",210,0
"Evaluation of the serum level of immunosuppressive substance in oral cancer patients. The serum level of immunosuppressive substance (IS) was studied in 40 patients with primary oral cancer and in 79 patients without cancer. Its usefulness was evaluated as a parameter for monitoring therapy as well as recurrence of the tumors. Mean values for serum IS in patients with cancer and patients without were 687 +/- 284 micrograms/mL and 464 +/- 153 micrograms/mL, respectively. Normal healthy controls had a mean value of 431 +/- 105 micrograms/mL, with the cutoff value set at 641 micrograms/mL (mean +2 SD). Patients without cancer who had a severe infectious disease showed conspicuously high serum IS levels, and these values were closely correlated with their C-reactive protein values. The positive rate of IS increased in all patients with oral cancer was 58%. The mean level of serum IS in cancer patients was significantly higher than that of the controls (P less than .01), and the level was found to be more elevated as the stage of the disease advanced (stage I to III, 48%; stage IV, 68%). Histologic analysis of the tumor cells in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) showed that the mean serum IS level of those who had poorly differentiated SCC was much higher (937 +/- 181 micrograms/mL) than that of patients with well-differentiated SCC (616 +/- 159 micrograms/mL). Patients who had recurrent or metastatic cancer, or those who died from the cancer exhibited marked elevation of the serum IS levels, whereas patients who remained free of cancer in the follow-up period showed significantly lower serum IS levels. The rise and fall of the serum IS level was closely correlated with the disease progression and/or remission. These data strongly suggest that serum IS is a useful parameter for monitoring the disease stage as well as the effect of therapy on patients with oral cancer.",418,1
"Pretreatment neuropsychological status and associated factors in children with primary brain tumors. We report on the neuropsychological status of 31 children with primary brain tumors who underwent assessment before receiving therapy. Overall, the children performed within normal limits in all test areas. The exception was the group with anterior hemispheric tumors who demonstrated deficits in executive cognitive functions. Also, when compared according to tumor type, children with midline tumors and hydrocephalus performed more poorly than others on measures of intelligence, executive abilities, visual-motor skills, and fine-motor functions. Although one-half to two-thirds of the children with supratentorial midline and infratentorial tumors had cranial nerve, oculomotor, or cerebellar deficits, only the latter were associated with specific neuropsychological deficits (poorer performance on fine-motor and visual-motor tests). Age did not appear to be a factor in these children's neuropsychological test performances.",186,1
"Diagnostic imaging and surgical treatment of dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. We describe the diagnostic procedures and surgical approaches employed in 5 patients with dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately described the existence and longitudinal extension of the intraspinal component of the tumor and assisted in choosing the appropriate surgical approach. Both the intrathoracic and intraspinal components of the tumor were resected at one time by a thoracic and neurosurgical team. We employed the Grillo technique three times and a separate laminectomy and thoracotomy approach. Magnetic resonance imaging proved the most useful diagnostic technique for suspected dumbbell mediastinal tumors. In our experience, the extended thoracotomy proposed by Grillo and co-workers worked well for small tumors involving only one foramen in which the intraspinal extension was limited to 2 to 3 cm, and when no more than two laminectomies were required. On the other hand, thoracotomy and a longitudinal paravertebral incision are preferable for larger tumors (more than 4 cm) involving more than one foramen in which the intraspinal extension exceeds 2 to 3 cm, for tumors requiring multiple laminectomy, and when bony infiltration is present.",245,0
"NB4, a maturation inducible cell line with t(15;17) marker isolated from a human acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3). Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a well-defined entity among acute leukemia, cytogenetically characterized by a t(15;17) (q22;q11-12) translocation. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) treatment restores cell maturation. We have isolated the first permanent cell line with t(15;17), derived from the marrow of a patient with APL in relapse. The establishment of the cell line, its morphologic, karyotypic, and immunohistochemical features are reported. RA induced cell line maturation. Cells strongly expressed myeloid markers, but also some T-cell markers. Additional karyotypic abnormalities, a 12p rearrangement and the possible presence of a homogeneous staining region (HSR) on 19q+ are discussed both in relation to T-cell (CD2, CD4) and monocyte (CD9) markers, and to the acquired cell growth autonomy. The cell line represents a remarkable tool for biomolecular studies.",249,1
"Benign parotid tumour enucleation--a reliable operation in selected cases. The method of surgical treatment for benign tumours of the parotid gland had not yet been rationalized, but many authors recommend parotidectomy as the most appropriate procedure. A series of 289 operations for parotid swelling is reported; the majority of mixed and Warthin's tumours underwent enucleation without either complications or recurrence. The rationale of parotidectomy versus enucleation is discussed but in fast growing, deeply infiltrating and recurrent tumours, parotidectomy appears to be the best choice. In the other group of more commonly occurring tumours, enucleation represents a reliable time saving option.",139,1
"Adjuvant antiestrogen therapy for breast cancer. Past, present, and future. Laboratory investigations using animal models of breast cancer growth have indicated that the antiestrogenic compound tamoxifen is a tumoristatic agent. It is therefore effective in suppressing, rather than destroying, the breast tumor. Its use as an adjuvant in breast cancer management has been successful, with a proportion of women benefiting from long periods of tamoxifen treatment. All the initial studies recruited postmenopausal women, but tamoxifen is now proposed for the treatment of premenopausal women for an extended time. Naturally, there are many aspects of the toxicology of tamoxifen to consider; however, careful monitoring of clinical trials will determine the safety of the drug for the general patient population.

"Greenfield filter as primary therapy for deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer. In 1985, as a result of the high complication rate associated with anticoagulants in patients who have cancer and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), we established a policy of placing Greenfield filters (GFs) as primary therapy instead of anticoagulation. Since 1985 we have been asked to consult in the treatment of 18 patients with cancer and with DVT and/or PE, and we have placed a GF in each of these patients. This represented 34% (18/53) of the filters placed during that same period. Over the same 4-year period, 11 patients with cancer and DVT and/or PE underwent anticoagulation therapy. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of anticoagulation versus GF insertion in these two groups of patients. A significantly higher number of major complications (n = 4) occurred in the anticoagulation group (p less than 0.05, Fisher's exact test) than in the GF group (n = 0). The four complications that occurred in the anticoagulation group included three bleeding episodes (tumor bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hip hematoma) and one PE, despite adequate anticoagulation. Two patients died as a direct result of these complications (PE and gastrointestinal bleeding). The three patients with bleeding complications each required a transfusion of more than 3 units of blood. All four of the patients with complications had metastatic disease (pancreatic carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate carcinoma, and uterine carcinoma). Although this is a small, nonrandomized, nonprospective study, the data seem to indicate that GF placement is safer than anticoagulation for DVT or PE in patients with cancer and particularly in patients with metastatic disease. We conclude that GF insertions may be a better primary treatment than anticoagulation.",401,1
"The prophylactic use of octreotide in a patient with ovarian carcinoid and valvular heart disease. This case report describes the use of octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, in the management of a patient with an ovarian carcinoid tumour and severe cardiac valvular disease. This patient underwent laparotomy and tumour resection without complication. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with isoflurane as well as additional fentanyl and vecuronium. However, we feel that it was the use of octreotide that prevented a life-threatening crisis intraoperatively, and recommend its use in patients with carcinoid syndrome undergoing anaesthesia and surgery.

"Leucine kinetics in patients with benign disease, non-weight-losing cancer, and cancer cachexia: studies at the whole-body and tissue level and the response to nutritional support. We have performed intraoperative isotopic infusions of carbon 14-labeled leucine in 65 patients to define the abnormalities in protein metabolism at both the whole-body and tissue level in patients with weight-losing and non-weight-losing cancer. Eighteen patients had benign disease, 26 had non-weight-losing cancer, and 21 had cancer cachexia. Samples of plasma and expired breath were taken to determine rates of whole-body protein synthesis (WBPS), whole-body protein catabolism (WBPC), net protein catabolism, and albumin fractional synthetic rates. Tissue samples were taken to determine the fractional synthetic rates (FSR) of protein in muscle, liver, cancer, and the tissue in which the cancer arose. In addition, in 14 patients the effect of nutritional support on protein metabolism was assessed. In all parameters examined we were unable to detect any significant differences between patients with no cancer and the patients with non-weight-losing cancer. In contrast, patients with cancer cachexia had a significant elevation (p less than 0.005) in WBPC compared with the other two groups. WBPS was also elevated (to a lesser extent) in the patients with cancer cachexia, and the rate of net protein catabolism was increased significantly (p less than 0.05). Patients with cancer cachexia also had significantly higher values of FSR of protein in muscle (p less than 0.05), liver (p less than 0.05), and albumin (p less than 0.01) compared with the other two groups. In addition, the protein FSR in the cancer rose progressively when the values for the primary cancer were compared with those for nodal and systemic metastases. Further, although nutritional support resulted in an increase in host muscle protein synthesis (p less than 0.04), there was no promotion of FSR of protein in cancer. We conclude that patients with cancer cachexia are actively losing protein as a result of an increase in WBPC that is only partially compensated for by an increase in WBPS. There are compensatory increases in protein synthesis in muscle and liver, but these increases in host protein synthesis are insufficient to keep pace with the combined effect of the accelerated rate of protein synthesis in the cancer per se and the accelerated rate of net protein catabolism at the whole-body level. In response to nutritional support, there is a significant increase in the muscle protein synthesis, but we could not demonstrate any increase in cancer protein synthesis.",554,1
"Adenocarcinoma of the appendiceal stump. We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with nonspecific abdominal complaints in whom barium enema and subsequent colonoscopy showed a 3 cm lobulated adenocarcinoma within a villous adenoma arising from the appendiceal stump. Because such appendiceal malignancies have no specific clinical signs, symptoms, or radiologic features, preoperative diagnosis is extremely difficult, and colonoscopy may be required to clarify radiologically demonstrated irregularities.",100,1
"Decrease in mean platelet survival time in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). In an attempt to study further the possible participation of platelets in the pathogenesis of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), we studied the platelet survival time, as an index of platelet activation, in 22 patients with APSGN. Mean platelet survival time was computed from the disappearance of radioactivity from blood, sampled serially after injection of autologous 51Cr-labelled platelets. C1q solid phase ELISA and conglutinin (K) solid phase ELISA were used to measure the serum levels of immune complexes. The platelet survival time in APSGN patients was 113 +/- 10 h vs 197 +/- 10 h in the control group (p less than 0.001); 68% of the patients had a shortened platelet survival, lower than 95% confidence limit. There was a significant increase in the platelet survival in the six patients that were studied after recovery from acute nephritic syndrome. There was no significant association between the mean platelet times survival and CICs (circulating immune complexes). Similarly, no significant correlation was found between the mean platelet lifespan and the severity of the glomerular disease, as assessed by the serum creatinine level and the proteinuria. These results support evidence of platelet activation and consumption in APSGN and we suggest that this activation occurs in the glomeruli capillary wall, due to platelet-vascular wall interaction.",305,0
"Transformation-associated alterations in interactions between pre-B cells and fibronectin. Marrow stromal elements produce as yet uncharacterized soluble growth factors that can stimulate the proliferation of murine pre-B cells, although close contact between these two cell types appears to ensure a better pre-B cell response. We have now shown that freshly isolated normal pre-B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu- fraction of adult mouse bone marrow) adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site, as shown in a serum-free adherence assay, and they lose this functional ability on differentiation in vivo into B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu+ fraction). Similarly, cells from an immortalized but stromal cell-dependent and nontumorigenic murine pre-B cell line originally derived from a Whitlock-Witte culture were also found to adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site. Moreover, in the presence of anti-FN receptor antibodies, the ability of this immortalized pre-B cell line to proliferate when co-cultured with a supportive stromal cell line (M2-10B4 cells) was markedly reduced (down to 30% of control). This suggests that pre-B cell attachment to FN on stromal cells may be an important component of the mechanism by which stromal cells stimulate normal pre-B cell proliferation and one that is no longer operative to control their more differentiated progeny. Two differently transformed pre-B cell lines, both of which are autocrine, stromal-independent, tumorigenic in vivo, and partially or completely differentiation-arrested at a very early stage of pre-B cell development, did not bind to FN. In addition, anti-FN receptor antibodies were much less effective in diminishing the ability of these tumorigenic pre-B cells to respond to M2-10B4 cell stimulation, which could still be demonstrated when the tumorigenic pre-B cells were co-cultured with M2-10B4 cells at a sufficiently low cell density. Analysis of cell surface molecules immunoprecipitated from both the nontumorigenic and tumorigenic pre-B cell lines by an anti-FN receptor antibody showed an increase in very late antigen (VLA) alpha chain(s) in both tumorigenic pre-B cell lines and a decrease in the beta 1 chain in one. Interestingly, all of the pre-B cell lines expressed similar amounts of messenger RNA for the beta 1 chain of the FN receptor. These results suggest that alteration of FN receptor expression on pre-B cells may represent a mechanism contributing to the outgrowth of leukemic pre-B cells with an autocrine phenotype and capable of stromal cell-independent, autonomous growth.",580,0
Numb chin syndrome secondary to Burkitt's cell acute leukemia. We describe a case of Burkitt's cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with the bilateral numb chin syndrome as the initial symptom of the disease.

"Effect of captopril injection in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. The effect of intravenous captopril was studied in 24 white patients who had moderate to severe hypertension. Patients received incremental doses of 1 to 10 mg delivered at 10 min intervals over 50 to 80 min. Blood pressure (BP) was lowered within 5 to 10 min after the initial dose was administered and continued to decline, reaching a maximum response after 20 min (2 to 4 mg). At this time group mean BP fell from 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 1 to 166 +/- 3/97 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Additional dose increments to an average cumulative dose of 40 mg did not increase the initial effect. No adverse side effects or symptomatic hypotension occurred in any subject. There was a significant correlation between diastolic BP decreases observed in response to intravenous captopril and subsequent long-term oral captopril therapy. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide increased the proportion of patients reaching normotension. We conclude that small intravenous bolus injections of captopril appear to be effective rapidly and are well tolerated in moderate to severe essential hypertension. Short-term intravenous administration seems to predict the response to chronic oral captopril therapy.",280,0

Complete repair was successfully performed by excision of the aneurysm and Dacron patch reconstruction of the left ventricular free wall.

"Intraluminal pressure adjacent to left colonic anastomoses. A cumulative total of 89 h of pressure data was acquired from both sides of a left colonic anastomosis in 15 patients over a median period of 7 postoperative study days. Patients had a colonic ileus lasting 3-10 days and during this proximal and distal inactivity the intraluminal pressure remained within 6 mmHg of atmospheric pressure. After recovery of activity, pressures proximal to the anastomosis in excess of 10 mmHg occurred during less than 1 per cent of the recording time. Distal peak pressures were significantly elevated with respect to the proximal site (P less than 0.001). Two-thirds of the distal pressures recorded were between 10 and 20 mmHg and 98 per cent were less than 50 mmHg; the peak distal pressure was 90 mmHg. Four patients had distal repetitive tonic contractions creating a pressure difference across the anastomosis with a mean of 20 mmHg and a peak of 45 mmHg. Each contraction persisted for 15-20 min. Intraluminal pressures are unlikely to play a role in anastomotic dehiscence.",250,1
"Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments in patients with AIDS and necrotizing retinal infections. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments can occur in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and necrotizing retinal infections. Of 68 patients with AIDS and necrotizing retinal infections seen between 1983 and 1987, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments developed in 16 patients (27 eyes). In this group, cytomegalovirus retinopathy was present in 75% (12 of 16) of patients, 18.8% (3 of 16) had probable herpes simplex virus retinopathy, and 6.2% (1 of 16) had toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Retinal detachment was bilateral in 68.8% (11 of 16) of patients. The retina was reattached successfully in 91% (10 of 11) of operated eyes. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy was present preoperatively in 95% of these eyes. Seven of 11 operated eyes had initial improvement in visual acuity. However, 5 of 11 continued to lose vision despite successful reattachment. Techniques included pneumatic reattachment, scleral buckle, vitrectomy, and silicone oil injection. Complicated retinal detachments in AIDS patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments and necrotizing retinal infections are common and can be repaired, but the prognosis is guarded in many patients.",310,0
"Subclinical vulvar papillomavirus infection. Eighty-eight cases of subclinical human papillomavirus (HPV) vulvar infection were detected in a consecutive colposcopic series of 968 women. Three patterns of acetowhite lesions had a 72% predictive value (88/122) for histologically assessed HPV. The prevalence of subclinical vulvar HPV in self-referred patients was 7.9% (73/918); it was 9% (88/968) in the overall series and significantly higher in younger patients (age less than 25 years: 21/106, or 19.8%) or in those with cervical HPV or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (40/100, or 40%). Routine inspection of the vulva after acetic acid lavage in association with a Papanicolaou test might help identify Papanicolaou-test-negative patients at high risk of developing cervical HPV or CIN.

Results suggest that under controlled conditions which eliminated the effects of diet and overlapping levodopa effects the response to levodopa remained unchanged throughout the day, and that the duration of response could be predicted by plasma levodopa levels.

"Incisional parapubic hernias. A parapubic hernia, distinct from other lower abdominal wall hernias, is identified as a particular type of incisional hernia. This hernia results from the disruption of the musculotendinous elements of the abdominal wall as they insert into the pubis. This disruption is brought about by either the destruction of these musculotendinous tissues at their lower end or the resection of portions of the pubic bone as is sometimes done in suprapubic radical prostatectomies for easier access to the prostate. Seven cases have been identified and reported. Men and women were seen to make up a clinical picture that is suggestive of the diagnosis, namely, multiple previous operations through the lower abdominal wall, procedures of a gynecologic or urologic nature, a herniation that mimics an incisional or inguinal hernia, and a defect that cannot possibly be corrected without the use of a prosthesis. When the diagnosis is accurately established, the polypropylene mesh is inserted in the preperitoneal space and anchored laterally to the ligaments of Cooper and in between to the arcuate pubic ligament and the periosteum of the posterior aspect of the pubis. Excellent results have been obtained, and the success must be ascribed to the recognition of the parapubic hernia as a distinct entity. ",265,0
"Erythema infectiosum and pregnancy-related complications Erythema infectiosum, an acute, communicable viral disease with a highly distinctive exanthem, follows the usual course of a self-limiting benign disease. In pregnant women, however, it may be associated with fetal death and nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Because of the association of human parvovirus (HPV) B19 infection with fetal damage we reviewed the current knowledge of the clinical aspects of erythema infectiosum, focusing on pregnancy and fetal outcome, to determine the magnitude of fetal risk and offer recommendations for management. Among 180 infected pregnant women 44 fetal deaths (24%) occurred, 1 to 12 weeks after the infection was noted. Pregnant women should be advised that (a) because of the high prevalence (up to 65%) of anti-HPV B19 IgG antibody among adults most of them are not at risk and (b) if maternal infection does occur therapeutic abortion is not indicated since intrauterine infection causes fetal death more often than abnormal development. Infection should be suspected in pregnant women who exhibit the symptoms of erythema infectiosum with or without arthropathy. They should be monitored for an elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level (indicating fetal aplastic crisis) and undergo serial ultrasonography for the detection of hydrops fetalis. Although the incidence of congenital malformation is no higher than the expected rate in the general population (3% to 5%), the precise incidence of fetal adverse outcomes remains unknown and requires investigation in larger, prospective studies.",320,0
"Prognostic value of DNA flow cytometry in paragangliomas of the carotid body. A carotid body tumor is a paraganglioma of the carotid bifurcation. Histologic appearance does not correlate with the malignant potential of the lesion, and thus a reliable prognostic marker for these tumors is lacking. To determine whether flow cytometric analysis of paraffin block specimens by DNA index and synthetic phase fraction (SPF) would be of prognostic value, a retrospective chart review of 14 patients with carotid body tumors was performed. Three of 14 tumors were aneuploid and were the only tumors with SPF greater than 15%. One of 3 patients (33%) with an aneuploid tumor (SPF = 22%) developed a local recurrence; no patient with a diploid tumor developed a recurrence. Two of 3 (67%) patients with aneuploid tumors (SPF = 18%) but only 1 of 11 (9%) with a diploid tumor were symptomatic preoperatively (P = 0.03). DNA index and SPF may help select a subgroup of patients with more aggressive tumors who are at increased risk for recurrence and therefore require closer follow-up.",240,1
"Immunoglobulins from animal models of motor neuron disease and from human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients passively transfer physiological abnormalities to the neuromuscular junction. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating human disease of upper and lower motoneurons of unknown etiology. In support of the potential role of autoimmunity in ALS, two immune-mediated animal models of motoneuron disease have been developed that resemble ALS with respect to the loss of motoneurons, the presence of IgG within motoneurons and at the neuromuscular junction, and with respect to altered physiology of the motor nerve terminal. To provide direct evidence for the primary role of humoral immunity, passive transfer with immunoglobulins from the two animal models and human ALS was carried out. Mice injected with serum or immunoglobulins from the animal disease models and human ALS but not controls demonstrated IgG in motoneurons and at the neuromuscular junction. The mice also demonstrated an increase in miniature end-plate potential (mepp) frequency, with normal amplitude and time course and normal resting membrane potential, indicating an increased resting quantal release of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal. The ability to transfer motoneuron dysfunction with serum immunoglobulins provides evidence for autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both the animal models and human ALS. ",257,0
"Denervation in hemiplegic muscles. This study examined the frequency of denervation activity in hemiplegic muscles in relation to the size and location of the central lesion. We studied 20 patients, 14 with major unilateral cerebral infarctions in the middle cerebral or internal carotid territories; four with a single lacune in the pons, internal capsule, or thalamus; and two with precentral infarcts. Using somatosensory evoked potentials, motor conduction studies, and assessments of conduction across the plexus and roots, we detected no conduction abnormalities on the affected side. Fibrillation was common in both groups, especially in distal and intermediate muscles. The distribution of the fibrillation and the normal conduction studies suggested that trauma of peripheral nerves was not a factor. Although the normal conduction studies and pattern of fibrillation activity do not exclude peripheral nerve trauma as the cause of the fibrillation, we suggest that transsynaptic degeneration is a reasonable alternative explanation.",190,0
"Isolated calf venous thrombosis: diagnosis with compression US. Compression ultrasound (US) is an excellent means of evaluating the femoral and popliteal veins but is generally regarded as inadequate for the diagnosis of calf vein thrombosis. This prospective study evaluated compression sonography of the calf veins in 45 symptomatic patients with normal femoral and popliteal veins. All patients underwent correlative venography. Compression US enabled identification of 15 of 17 patients with calf vein thrombosis (sensitivity, 88%). The two false-negative results were in patients with small isolated thrombi. Compression US results were true-negative in 26 of 27 patients with normal venograms (specificity, 96%). If these results can be duplicated by other investigators in larger series of patients, compression US will be an adequate screening modality for calf vein thrombosis.",172,0
"Transesophageal Doppler color flow mapping assessment of atrial septal defect. Transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging was performed in 19 adult patients (mean age 35 years) with an atrial septal defect demonstrated by cardiac catheterization or at surgery, or both. The transesophageal study correctly identified and classified 19 of 19 shunts in contrast to 16 of 18 shunts identified by the transthoracic approach. The area of the atrial septal defect was calculated by assuming it to be circular and taking the maximal Doppler color flow jet width at the defect site as its diameter. The pulsed Doppler sample volume was placed parallel to the shunt flow direction at the defect site to obtain the mean velocity and flow duration. From these values, the shunt volume was calculated as a product of the defect area, mean velocity, flow duration and heart rate. The calculated shunt flow volume obtained by transesophageal study showed a good correlation with shunt flow volume (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) obtained at cardiac catheterization. The size of the defect by transesophageal Doppler color flow mapping correlated fairly well with the size estimated at surgery (r = 0.73, p = 0.004). It is concluded that transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging is useful in the detection and classification of atrial septal defects and in the assessment of shunt volumes.",320,0
"Transaortic endarterectomy of renal visceral artery lesions in association with infrarenal aortic surgery. The complexity of infrarenal aortic reconstruction increases when bypass grafts to revascularize associated renal and visceral arteries are needed. Lesions in these vessels, however, are usually limited to their aortic orifices and therefore are amenable to retroperitoneal transaortic endarterectomy. A combined infrarenal aortic reconstruction and transaortic endarterectomy of the renal/visceral vessels was used in 18 (16%) of 120 patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction over a 2-year-period. Transaortic endarterectomy was performed primarily for renal preservation in 11 patients with bilateral, high-grade renal artery stenoses and abnormal renal function (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.9 mg/dl). In seven patients transaortic endarterectomy was performed as a secondary procedure during the course of complex reconstruction of aneurysmal or occlusive aortic disease. Mean serum creatinine, which was elevated preoperatively in 14 (78%) patients (3.3 mg/dl), decreased significantly after the operation (2.0 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). A single death occurred in the 18 patients undergoing transaortic endarterectomy. Renal function preservation can be achieved by renal revascularization in patients with bilateral renal artery stenoses and decreased renal function. The retroperitoneal approach to aortic reconstruction and the use of transaortic endarterectomy allows correction of most renal/visceral vessel involvement in complex aortic revascularization procedures.",328,0
"Management of renovascular disease. A surgical perspective. The role of surgical revascularization in the management of patients with renal artery disease has changed in recent years. This has occurred due to the advent of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as an effective method of treatment for certain patients, improved results of surgical revascularization in older patients with atherosclerosis, an enhanced appreciation of advanced atherosclerotic renal artery disease as a correctable cause of renal failure, and the development of more effective surgical techniques for patients with severe aortic atherosclerosis and branch renal artery disease. Surgical revascularization is currently the treatment of choice for patients with branch renal artery disease, ostial atherosclerotic renal artery disease, a renal artery aneurysm, and patients in whom renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been unsuccessful. Excellent clinical results continue to be achieved with surgical revascularization in properly selected patients. ",181,0
"Visual dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: relation to normal aging [published erratum appears in Ann Neurol 1991 Mar;29(3):271] In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), compared with age-matched and young healthy control subjects, visual deficits in the following functions were observed: color, stereoacuity, contrast sensitivity, and backward masking (homogeneous and pattern). Critical flicker fusion thresholds were normal, relative to age-matched healthy subjects. For color, the majority of the errors were tritanomalous (blue axis). Color and stereoacuity deficits were unrelated to severity of dementia, in accordance with models of vision that describe these functions as modular rather than diffuse for cortical localization. Although contrast sensitivity was depressed throughout the frequency range in AD, more patients were impaired at low than at high spatial frequencies, contrasting with the observed normal aging pattern of high-frequency loss. Healthy elderly subjects showed depressed critical flicker fusion thresholds and reduced contrast sensitivity at high frequencies, relative to the young group; differences between these groups were not found for the other vision tests. A subset of the AD group received detailed neuro-ophthalmological examination, and no abnormalities were found. This finding, taken together with normal thresholds for critical flicker fusion, suggests that the widespread visual dysfunction reported here is more likely to be related to known pathological changes in primary visual and association cortex in AD than to changes in the retina or optic nerve.",291,0
Esophageal and gastric endoscopy in critically ill patients. How can it help you? Bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract in a critically ill patient is a tough diagnostic situation.

"Basal cell-specific and hyperproliferation-related keratins in human breast cancer. In normal breast tissue and in noninvasive breast carcinomas, various keratin-14 antibodies were reactive predominantly with the basal/myoepithelial cell layer, although mainly in terminal and larger ducts luminal cells sometimes also were stained. A similar reaction pattern was found with an antibody directed against keratin 17, although this antibody was more often found negative than keratin 14 in the pre-existing myoepithelial cells in intraductal carcinomas. Furthermore antibodies reactive with hyperproliferation-related keratins 6 and 16 were used. One of these (LL025) was completely negative in normal breast tissue and noninvasive breast carcinomas. However 10% of the invasive carcinomas were diffusely or focally positive with this latter antibody, while in 18 of 115 cases of invasive breast carcinomas studied, a basal cell phenotype was detected. A relatively high concordance was found between the carcinomas immunostaining with the basal cell and the hyperproliferation-related keratins, but not between these markers and the proliferation marker Ki-67. This supports the conclusion that basal cells in breast cancer may show extensive proliferation, and that absence of Ki-67 staining does not mean that (tumor) cells are not proliferating.",284,1
"Circulating antibodies against human colonic extract enriched with a 40 kDa protein in patients with ulcerative colitis. We have previously described a 40 kDa colonic protein(s) which is specifically recognised by tissue-bound immunoglobulin G obtained from the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis. We now report the presence of circulating antibodies against this antigen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a highly enriched preparation of the 40 kDa protein from normal colon extracts. Serum was collected from 79 patients with ulcerative colitis, 36 with Crohn's disease, 16 with specific diarrhoeal syndromes, and from 19 normal subjects. Twenty nine of 79 patients with ulcerative colitis, 21 of 36 with Crohn's disease, and all patients with diarrhoea were symptomatic during the collection of sera. The difference in optical density values between patients with symptomatic ulcerative colitis and each of the other groups, including patients with ulcerative colitis in remission, was highly significant (p less than 0.01). Seventy nine per cent of patients with symptomatic ulcerative colitis had optical density values above the means for all other groups. Fifty five per cent of sera from patients with symptomatic ulcerative colitis had optical densities beyond two SDs of the values for all other groups and only two of 71 sera from non-ulcerative colitis patients (one Crohn's disease and one normal subject) had values in this range. These results show the presence of anti-colon antibodies against the 40 kDa protein(s) in the sera of many patients with symptomatic ulcerative colitis.",332,0
"Murine retroviral neurovirulence correlates with an enhanced ability ofvirus to infect selectively, replicate in, and activate resident microglial cells [published erratum appears in Am J Pathol 1991 May;138(5):1058] To determine the biologic basis of ts1 MoMuLV neurovirulence in vivo, newborn CFW/D mice were inoculated with neurovirulent ts1 MoMuLV and nonneurovirulent wt MoMuLV and the temporal response to virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS), spleen, and thymus was studied comparatively. Experimental procedures included single and double labeling in situ immunohistochemistry with selective morphometric analyses, and steady state immunoblotting of viral proteins. Cellular targets for virus infection were identical for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV and consisted sequentially of 1) splenic megakaryocytes, 2) splenic and thymic lymphocytes, 3) CNS capillary endothelial cells, and 4) CNS pericytes and microglia. Resident microglial cells served as the major reservor and amplifier of virus infection in the CNS of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice; a similar but much less significant role was played by microglia in wt MoMuLV-infected mice. The genesis and progression of severe spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice were both temporally and spatially correlated with amplified virus infection of microglia, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of both virus-infected and nonvirus-infected microglial cells. Direct virus infection of neurons was never observed. The development of clinical neurologic disease and spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice correlated with the accumulation of both viral gag and env gene products in the CNS; there was no selective accumulation of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env. When compared to wt MoMuLV-infected mice, the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice occurred by an enhanced ability to replicate in the CNS and to infect and activate more microglia, rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism or topography of virus infection.",430,0
"Modified Van Nes rotationplasty in the treatment of malignant neoplasms in the lower extremities of children. A technique of modified Van Nes rotationplasty has been used since 1981 for limb salvage surgery in children and adolescents with malignant sarcoma of the lower extremity. The original procedure for lesions of the distal femur was further modified and adopted for selected lesions of the proximal femur and tibia. Sixteen skeletally immature children form the base of this report. The tumors were located in the distal femur in ten children, the proximal tibia in five and the proximal femur in one. There were no intraoperative complications and postoperative complications included one infection requiring debridement and three minor healing delays. There were no local recurrences, neurovascular compromises, late derotations, or psychologic decompensations. One patient died of metastatic disease and another died of a second malignancy (leukemia). The remaining patients are good, functional, below-knee prosthesis users who participate in a number of sporting and athletic activities. The procedure is safe, has a relatively low complication rate, allows for the functional demands of an active, growing child, and accommodates for the future growth of extremities.",234,1
"Molecular structure of a major insulin/mitogen-activated 70-kDa S6 protein kinase. The molecular structure of a rat hepatoma 70-kDa insulin/mitogen-stimulated S6 protein kinase, obtained by molecular cloning, is compared to that of a rat homolog of the 85-kDa Xenopus S6 protein kinase alpha; both kinases were cloned from H4 hepatoma cDNA libraries. The 70-kDa S6 kinase (calculated molecular mass of 59,186 Da) exhibits a single catalytic domain that is most closely related in amino acid sequence (56% identity) to the amino-terminal, kinase C-like domain of the rat p85 S6 kinase (calculated molecular mass of 82,695 Da); strong similarity extends through a further 67 residues carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain (40% identity), corresponding to a region also conserved among the kinase C family. Outside of this segment of approximately 330 amino acids, the structures of the p70 and p85 S6 kinases diverge substantially. The p70 S6 kinase is known to be activated through serine/threonine phosphorylation by unidentified insulin/mitogen-activated protein kinases. A model for the regulation of p70 S6 protein kinase activity is proposed wherein the low activity of the unphosphorylated enzyme results from the binding of a basic, inhibitory pseudosubstrate site (located carboxyl-terminal to the extended catalytic domain) to an acidic substrate binding region (located amino-terminal to the catalytic domain); substrate binding is thereby prevented. S6 kinase activation requires displacement of this inhibitory segment, which is proposed to occur consequent to its multiple phosphorylation. The putative autoinhibitory segment contains several serine and threonine residues, each followed directly by a proline residue. This motif may prevent autophosphorylation but permit transphosphorylation; two of these serine residues reside in a maturation promoting factor (MPF)/cdc-2 consensus motif. Thus, hormonal regulation of S6 kinase may involve the action of MPF/cdc-2 or protein kinases with related substrate specificity.",439,1
"Neurologic complications in chronic renal failure: a retrospective study. We have retrospectively examined 324 patients with chronic renal failure and evaluated the probable underlying causes of neurologic complications, laboratory data and therapeutic interventions. The common neurologic problems in our patients were alterations in consciousness (40.7%) and convulsions (35.1%). When BUN concentration was above 135 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was below 8 m/min/1.73 m2, alteration of consciousness was observed and when BUN concentration was 200 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was below 7 m/min/1.73 m2, abnormal convulsives appeared. Changes in deep tendon reflexes and pathologic reflexes were associated with hypertension. All of the patients with cortical atrophy using computerized cranial tomography aluminum hydroxide at least for 18 months, and six of them had hemodialysis. Fourteen patients who underwent dialysis developed convulsions and were thought to have disequilibrium syndrome. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the metabolic and biochemical derangements associated with CRF may be particularly detrimental to the still developing CNS of the child.",232,0

"Evidence of heterogeneous mechanisms in lipoprotein lipid alterations in hyperandrogenic women. Fifty-one hyperandrogenic women had their lipoprotein lipid profiles determined. Free and albumin-bound testosterone was associated with triglycerides and with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels, percent ideal body weight, and waist/hip ratio. To gain insight into mechanisms of these lipid alterations, the women were subgrouped according to apparent source of androgen excess. Whereas all groups had low levels of high-density lipoprotein-2 cholesterol and high triglyceride concentrations, only in those with high luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratios was free and albumin-bound testosterone associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels. Relationships between percent ideal body weight and waist/hip ratios, free and albumin-bound testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, fasting insulin and 2-hour insulin levels and blood pressure are not significant in all subgroups, suggesting differing endocrinological influences and differing mechanisms for lipoprotein lipid alterations.",206,1
"Acute promyelocytic leukemia: impact of hemorrhagic complications on response to induction chemotherapy and survival. From 1976 to 1989, 21 adult patients with previously untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia were seen at the University of Virginia Hospital. We reviewed their cases retrospectively to determine the impact of hemorrhagic complications and other factors on treatment outcome. We observed a complete remission rate of 35%; the median survival in complete responders was 15 months. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was found in 13 (62%) of the 21 cases at diagnosis. Fatal intracranial hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, occurring in eight (40%) of the 20 patients evaluated. Initial leukocyte count greater than 4.0 x 10(9)/L and platelet count less than 20 x 10(9)/L were significantly associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. In patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage was reduced by treatment with heparin. The high mortality of 40% (8/20) due to intracranial hemorrhage during induction was a major contributor to the low complete remission rate of 35% (7/20) in this series of consecutive unselected patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia.",275,1
"Significance of anti-HBx antibodies in hepatitis B virus infection. Serological responses to hepatitis B virus-X determinants have been noted in human sera, but conflicting findings concerning the correlation of anti-HBx antibodies with different stages of hepatitis B virus infection or pathological sequelae have been reported. Using an adenovirus-based eukaryotic vector, the 17 kD X protein was efficiently expressed in 293 cells. Cellular extracts containing the eukaryotic X protein have been used to screen for anti-HBx antibodies by immunoblot analysis in a large panel of sera from patients affected by hepatitis B virus chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute viral hepatitis. Sera from 32 of 171 (19%) chronic hepatitis B virus patients were positive for anti-HBx antibodies. Only one of thirty-two (3%) HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive chronic hepatitis serum was anti-HBx positive. Very few sera from primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients showed positivity for anti-HBx (8 of 149 or 5%). Anti-HBx were also detected in 8 of 48 (17%) acute viral hepatitis patients. In the four cases that were followed up weekly, anti-HBx antibodies appeared 3 to 4 wk after the onset of the clinical signs. To compare the X protein expressed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells as a substrate for anti-HBx antibody detection, 171 sera were screened with HBx fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The prokaryotic cell extract test seems to be more sensitive. During the chronic phase of hepatitis B virus infection, the presence of anti-HBx antibodies detected with the eukaryotic cell extract correlates with the presence of well-established markers of ongoing viral replication: serum hepatitis B virus-DNA (p less than 0.001) and intrahepatic HBcAg expression (p less than 0.001).",404,0
Rupture of a benign mediastinal teratoma into the right pleural cavity. A 27-year-old woman with a ruptured mediastinal cystic teratoma had high levels of amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen in cystic fluid. The activity of the amylase is thought to be the most likely cause of the rupture. High levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in pleural fluid are not necessarily indicative of a malignant lesion but may suggest the presence of a ruptured teratoma in patients with mediastinal tumors.,106,1
"Rectal mucosal dysplasia in Crohn's disease. Serial sections of 812 rectal biopsy specimens from 356 Crohn's disease patients were analysed for mucosal epithelial dysplasia. Dysplasia was found in 18 patients (5%), with four showing dysplasia on repeat biopsy specimen. In these 22 biopsy specimens the dysplasia was mild in 13, moderate in nine, and severe in none. Subsequently, three patients (17%) developed neoplasms including carcinoma in two and an adenomatous polyp in one. In colectomy specimens which showed dysplasia, significantly more dysplastic changes were found in seven patients who underwent colonic resection than in 10 others who underwent operation but had no prior dysplasia (p less than 0.001).

"Noncoordinate regulation of alpha-1 adrenoreceptor coupling and reexpression of alpha skeletal actin in myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure in rats. To determine the effects of myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure on the regulation of surface alpha-1 adrenoreceptors and signal transduction, large infarcts were produced in rats and the animals killed seven days later. After the documentation of impaired left ventricular pump performance, radioligand binding studies of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor, norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositol turnover, and ADP ribosylation of 41 kD substrate by pertussis toxin were examined in the hypertrophying unaffected myocardium. Moreover, the expression of sarcomeric actin isoforms was analyzed by Northern blots and hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. Alpha-1 adrenoreceptor density was found not to be altered in membranes obtained from the spared left ventricular tissue, whereas phosphoinositol turnover was increased 3.1-fold in the viable myocytes of infarcted hearts. Furthermore, pertussis toxin substrate was augmented 2.5-fold in membranes prepared from the surviving left ventricular myocardium. Finally, an upregulation of the skeletal actin isoform was detected in the tissue of the failing left ventricle. In conclusion, the possibility is raised that in the presence of severe myocardial dysfunction and ongoing reactive hypertrophy, effector pathways linked to the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor may stimulate the myocyte hypertrophic response which would tend to normalize cardiac hemodynamics. The reexpression of alpha skeletal actin may be a molecular indicator of the persistance of an overload on the myocardium.",320,0
"Clinical significance of simple heart rate-adjusted ST segment depression in supine leg exercise in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. To evaluate the clinical significance of simple heart rate-adjusted ST segment depression (delta ST/delta HR) in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, 42 patients with stable exertional angina underwent supine leg exercise testing and cardiac catheterization. During exercise, heart rate, a multilead electrocardiogram, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure were recorded. The sensitivity and accuracy of the delta ST/delta HR criteria (greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min) were significantly greater than the conventional analysis of ST segment depression criteria (greater than or equal to 0.2 mV) for detecting three-vessel coronary artery disease at a matched specificity of 72% (100% versus 46%, 81% versus 64%, p less than 0.01). A significant linear correlation was found between maximum pulmonary artery wedge pressure increments during exercise (delta PAWP) or Gensini score and the delta ST/delta HR (delta PAWP: r = 0.51, p less than 0.001; Gensini score: r = 0.47, p less than 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the delta PAWP or Gensini score between patients with three-vessel disease who had delta ST/delta HR greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min and those with one- or two-vessel disease who had delta ST/delta HR greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min (delta PAWP: 18.1 +/- 2.0 versus 21.9 +/- 3.3, p = NS; Gensini score: 68.5 +/- 6.6 versus 66.3 +/- 11.3, p = NS). These findings demonstrate that delta ST/delta HR is more useful than a conventional analysis of ST segment depression for identifying not only anatomically severe coronary artery disease but also functionally severe coronary artery disease.",444,0

"The starved colon--diminished mucosal nutrition, diminished absorption, and colitis. Nutrition of colonic epithelial cells is mainly from short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by bacterial fermentation in the colonic lumen. n-Butyrate contributes more carbon of oxidation to epithelial cells than glucose or glutamine from the vasculature. Incomplete starvation of colonic epithelial cells through lack of luminal SCFAs leads, in the short term, to mucosal hypoplasia with either diminished absorption or diarrhea. A chronic lack of SCFAs or complete organ starvation in conjunction with other factors leads to nutritional colitis, either ""diversion colitis"" or ""starvation colitis."" Whether predominantly diarrhea or colitis develops in mucosal malnutrition appears to depend upon the severity and duration of starvation. Ulcerative colitis may be classified as a nutritional colitis in that colonic epithelial cells are unable to utilize SCFAs reflecting epithelial starvation despite abundant SCFAs. ",187,0
"Intraoperative dexamethasone irrigation in lumbar microdiskectomy. In 45 lumbar hemilaminectomy/microdiskectomy patients, a control group of 23 patients had the standard operative procedure. The remaining 22 patients were treated with intraoperative irrigation of long-acting dexamethasone before incision closure. Age, weight, gender ratio, mean postoperative hospital stay, mean in-hospital narcotics usage, and incidence of perioperative complications among the two groups were compared. Age and gender ratios were comparable, although the control group was significantly heavier in body weight than the steroid-irrigated group. The steroid-irrigated group had a significant reduction in hospitalization and a marked reduction in narcotics usage compared with the control group. Postoperative fever occurred in one patient in the steroid group. The control group had three postoperative complications. These preliminary observations suggest that dexamethasone irrigation during lumbar diskectomy is a safe and effective adjunct to surgical management.",187,0

"The role of the immunogenetics laboratory in marrow transplantation. Allogeneic marrow transplants from genotypically HLA-identical siblings have become lifesaving therapy for patients with various congenital and acquired diseases of the immune and hematopoietic systems. Unfortunately, less than 30% of patients in the United States have an HLA-identical sibling; therefore, many are denied the opportunity for potentially curative treatment for otherwise fatal conditions. The results of marrow transplantation from haploidentical family members who were partially compatible for nonshared haplotypes with the patients demonstrated the relevance of HLA compatibility for engraftment and graft-vs-host disease. These results have provided the rationale for using HLA-identical unrelated volunteers as marrow donors. The recent development of a national registry of volunteer bone marrow donors (the National Marrow Donor Program in the United States) has made it possible to access a centralized file of more than 260,000 HLA-typed volunteers. Marrow transplants from an unrelated donor have become feasible. However, our preliminary clinical experience clearly demonstrated an increase in the incidence and severity of graft-vs-host disease. It is likely that standard HLA typing techniques are not adequate to provide data for sufficient donor and recipient matching. It is possible that currently available molecular technology could be applied to HLA typing and donor matching to improve on clinical results.",266,1

There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. Delayed operation is not detrimental to infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.",111,0
"Nausea, vomiting, and retching. Although nausea, vomiting, and retching have plagued mankind since antiquity, limited attention has been given to the three symptoms as separate entities. Although knowledge of symptom occurrence is essential to practice, nurses must focus on patients' response or distress to the occurrence of symptoms. The differentiation of symptom occurrence and symptom distress of nausea, vomiting, and retching is critical to the management and self-care demands of patients and the enhancement of their quality of life. Basic research on patterns of these individual symptoms and their components promises to provide a more progressive and fruitful approach to the patient response to these symptoms. ",128,0
"Immunohistochemical study of fibronectin in experimental myocardial infarction. Light microscopic immunohistochemical studies were performed to evaluate the distribution of fibronectin in paraffin sections of p-formaldehyde-fixed normal rat hearts and the hearts of rats that had undergone ligation of the left coronary artery. A peroxidase-labeled antibody technique was used, together with appropriate immunohistochemical control procedures, for the localization of fibronectin in normal hearts and in the hearts of sham-operated animals. Fibronectin was localized in the interstitial space between myocytes, and beneath arterial, venous, and capillary endothelium. At 4 hours after coronary ligation, fibronectin was localized in a patchy fashion in the cytoplasm and interstitial space of some of the myocytes in the area supplied by the ligated vessel. At 24 hours, there was more intense, homogeneous staining in necrotic myocytes in the infarcted area and in the capillary endothelium in the border zone. At 48 hours, the intensity of staining for fibronectin was maximal in and between the necrotic myocytes in the center of the infarct and in proliferating and migrating capillaries and fibroblasts in the border zone. Similar patterns of localization were observed at 3 and 7 days after coronary ligation, but with progressive decreases in the intensity of staining. Two sources of fibronectin appeared to have contributed to these changes: plasma fibronectin diffusing through damaged blood vessels would account for the early staining observed in necrotic myocytes in the center of the infarct, whereas de novo synthesis of fibronectin by connective tissue cells and endothelial cells in sprouting capillaries would be responsible for the subsequent staining observed in viable capillaries in the border zone of the infarct. Known properties of fibronectin in vitro, combined with these in vivo observations, indicate that fibronectin may influence the thrombotic, inflammatory, angiogenic, and fibrotic processes involved in infarct healing.",386,0
"Osteoblastoma of the spine. A review of 75 cases. Clinical and radiologic features of 75 cases of osteoblastoma of the spine were reviewed. In addition to pain, which was the most frequent complaint, 18 patients demonstrated objective neurologic deficit, while scoliosis was observed in 17 patients. Aspirin yielded pain relief in 13 patients. Pathologic fracture was not encountered. The radiologic and histologic characteristics of osteoblastoma of the spine are indistinguishable from those arising in other sites. The typical lesion exhibited a well-defined, geographic margin with a sclerotic, frequently lobulated border. Approximately one half of the cases were predominantly lucent, the remainder displaying varying degrees of matrix mineralization. Distribution of the osteoblastomas through the spinal axis was as follows: cervical-29, thoracic-16, lumbar-17, sacral-13. Other significant findings included posterior element involvement in 73 of 75 cases, and a striking male to female ratio of 2.5 to 1.",217,1
"Quantitation of skin vasomotor control in normal subjects and in diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. Peripheral autonomic neuropathy in diabetes has been difficult to evaluate. We have developed a test to quantitate sympathetic skin vasomotor function in the extremities. Skin vasomotor reflexes were investigated after warming and cooling the left arm and recording changes in skin temperature as a measure of skin blood flow in the right hand and both feet. Twenty-three diabetic patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy and 28 healthy control subjects were examined. In contrast to the healthy subjects, the diabetic patients showed reduced or even absent responses in skin temperature to both warming and cooling. The rate of skin temperature decrease for the hand and feet during cooling, which was used as the actual parameter to quantitate skin vasomotor control, was significantly reduced in the diabetic group as compared with the healthy control subjects. We conclude that this technique provides a simple non-invasive method for quantitating skin vasomotor function in the extremities of diabetic patients.",195,0
"Evidence for the functional binding in vivo of tumor rejection antigens to antigen-presenting cells in tumor-bearing hosts. Spleen cells of BALB/c mice bearing a syngeneic CSA1M fibrosarcoma were treated with anti-Thy-1.2 antibody plus C, yielding a T cell-depleted, APC-containing fraction. The APC-containing fraction was first tested for its capacity to present exogenous modified-self or another tumor (Meth A) Ag after in vitro pulsing. The results showed comparable Ag-presenting capacities to those obtained by APC-containing fraction from normal spleen cells, indicating that APC function is not affected in tumor-bearing mice. We next examined whether APC from CSA1M-bearing mice bind endogenously generated CSA1M tumor Ag onto its surfaces to stimulate tumor-specific T cells. Five rounds of inoculation of APC-containing fraction from CSA1M-bearing mice without further in vitro pulsing resulted in the induction of potent anti-CSA1M immune resistance. The involvement of anti-CSA1M T cells in the induction of anti-CSA1M immunity was excluded by the fact that the in vivo immunity was excluded by the fact that the in vivo immunity was delivered by Thy-1+ cell-depleted, but not by Thy-1+ cell-enriched fractions of spleen cells from CSA1M-bearing mice. Moreover, the failure of Sephadex G10-passed spleen cells to deliver anti-CSA1M resistance demonstrated the absolute requirement of APC for inducing the in vivo immunity. Finally, this in vivo resistance was found to be tumor specific, because APC fractions from CSA1M-bearing and Meth A-bearing BALB/c mice induced immune resistance selective against the corresponding tumor cell challenge. These results indicate that APC from tumor-bearing hosts can not only exert unaffected APC function against exogenous Ag, but also function to present tumor Ag generated endogenously in the tumor-bearing state and to produce tumor-specific immunity in vivo.",411,1
"Concurrent and construct validity of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of the Development Edition (pilot version) of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) in groups of disabled and nondisabled children. The PEDI is a new functional assessment instrument for the evaluation of disabled children aged 6 months to 7 years. The PEDI has been developed to identify functional status and change along three dimensions: 1) functional skill level, 2) caregiver assistance, and 3) modifications or adaptive equipment used. The PEDIs were administered as a parental-report questionnaire, and the results were compared with data obtained by the Battelle Developmental Inventory Screening Test (BDIST). The BDIST is a standardized assessment with developmental and adaptive content. Subjects were 20 children between the ages of 2 and 8 years with arthritic conditions and spina bifida and 20 nondisabled children matched for age and sex. All subjects' scores on the BDIST cognitive domain were no greater than 1.50 standard deviations below the mean for their age group. Concurrent validity was supported by moderately high Pearson product-moment correlations between BDIST and PEDI summary scores (r = .70-.80). Construct validity was supported by significant differences between the disabled and nondisabled groups' PEDI scores and by discriminant analysis identifying the PEDI scores as better group discriminators than the BDIST scores. Results validate the Developmental Edition of the PEDI and support the further development and standardization of the final version. Use of the PEDI in clinical pediatric physical therapy practice is discussed.",331,0
"Radiographic detection of recurrent carious lesions associated with composite restorations. The greatest potential problem associated with posterior composite restoration is secondary caries detection. It is essential that secondary caries is detected as early as possible to enhance the prognosis for a successful treatment outcome. This laboratory study evaluated the optimum level of radiopacity of composite materials for radiographic detection of secondary carious lesions associated with composite materials. Results indicated that for the radiologic detection of secondary caries, it is sufficient for composite materials to have the same level of radiopacity as enamel. ",109,0
"Visual disturbance in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Visual disturbance in 11 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk was analyzed. Goldmann visual field examination showed enlargement of Mariotte's blind spot in 7 of 10 patients (70%) and visual field defect or depression in 7 patients (70%). In 6 of the 7 patients with visual field defect of depression (86%), the portion of visual field damage corresponded with the location of the tumor and retinal nerve fiber bundle defect. In 1 patient, sudden loss of visual acuity occurred, presumably due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy induced by melanocytoma.",136,1
"Effect of dietary alpha-linolenic acid on growth, metastasis, fatty acid profile and prostaglandin production of two murine mammary adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary (n-3) fatty acids would affect mammary tumor growth and metastasis. Weanling female BALB/c mice were fed diets that contained 10% corn oil (CO), linseed oil (LO) or a fish oil-corn oil mix (FO) for 3-8 wk prior to receiving subcutaneous injections of one of two syngeneic mammary tumor cell types (410 and 410.4). Tumor growth was assessed by monitoring mean tumor diameter and tumor weight upon removal. Feeding LO, but not FO, reduced the growth (p less than 0.05) of 410.4 mammary tumors compared with growth in those fed CO. Metastasis data paralleled the tumor growth rate. Feeding LO and FO enhanced (p less than 0.005) incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids into tumors. Tumor prostaglandin E (PGE) production was reduced (p less than 0.005) by LO and FO, compared with CO. FO feeding reduced 410.4 tumor PGE synthesis more (p less than 0.05) than LO feeding, yet tumor growth was only inhibited by LO. These data suggest an inhibitory effect of dietary linolenic acid [i.e., 18:3 (n-3)] on mammary tumor growth and metastasis. However, this effect did not directly correlate with diet-induced changes in PGE synthesis.",340,1
"Colonic polyamine content and ornithine decarboxylase activity as markers for adenomas. Polyamine content (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) or ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was measured in normal-appearing colonic mucosa from patients undergoing colonoscopy. Comparisons were made between those with and those without adenomatous polyps. Colonic mucosal polyamine content was measured in 44 persons. Mean putrescine content was 1.25 +/- 0.26 (SE) nmol/mg protein in 22 patients with adenomatous polyps compared with 0.53 +/- 0.12 nmol/mg protein in patients without polyps (P less than 0.02). Tissue content of spermidine and spermine did not differ between these two groups. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was measured in tissue from 45 patients. Mean ODC activity was 2.84 +/- 0.73 pmol/hr/mg protein in 23 persons with adenomatous polyps compared with 1.15 +/- 0.18 pmol/hr/mg protein in persons without polyps (P less than 0.05). Mucosal putrescine and ODC activity are elevated in patients with adenomatous polyps compared with patients without polyps. These biochemical markers may prove helpful in improving surveillance methods for colorectal cancer and premalignant adenomatous polyps.",297,0
"Thromboexclusion of the right ventricle in children with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. Twelve children with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum underwent closure of the tricuspid valve as a part of a new surgical procedure. In two cases a concomitant Fontan operation was performed. In each patient the right ventricle was very small and right ventricular pressure was higher than systemic pressure. Ventricle-coronary connections provided flow of desaturated blood from the right ventricle into the coronary arteries in 11 of 12 cases. Five of the 12 children did not survive operation and postmortem examination of each revealed severe acute and chronic myocardial ischemic damage and high-grade obstruction or interruption of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Preoperative angiography demonstrated occlusive changes in the coronary arteries, resulting in right ventricular dependent circulation, in all five children who died and in one child who survived operation. Seven children who survived operation are well 4 months to 3.5 years later. Two have undergone subsequent successful Fontan operation and two others are considered suitable candidates for this operation. Tricuspid valve closure is recommended for a carefully selected group of infants with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum provided a right ventricular-dependent coronary circulation can be excluded on the basis of preoperative coronary cineangiography.",261,0
"Alcohol consumption--a risk factor for hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke. PURPOSE: The risks of alcohol consumption and its association with stroke were studied in 621 patients with stroke and 573 control subjects using case-control methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stroke were subdivided into 193 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 91 with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 337 with cerebral infarction. Data on recent alcohol consumption were obtained by questionnaire in patients with stroke and compared with data from an occupational screening survey in control subjects. RESULTS: Relative risks, adjusted for confounding variables, exhibited J-shaped associations with increasing levels of alcohol consumption classified into four categories--abstainer, 1 to 90 g, 100 to 390 g, and greater than or equal to 400 g weekly). The individual risks were 1, 0.7, 0.5, and 1.3 for subarachnoid hemorrhage; 1.0, 0.6, 0.5., and 2.5 for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 1.0, 0.6, 0.7, and 2.4 for cerebral infarction for men and women combined. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that low levels of alcohol consumption may have some protective effect upon the cerebral vasculature, whereas heavy consumption predisposes to both hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke.",305,0
"Myasthenic thymus and thymoma are selectively enriched in acetylcholine receptor-reactive T cells. We compared T-cell proliferative responses to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and to purified protein derivative (PPD) (of tuberculin) of hyperplastic thymus, thymoma, and blood cells from patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Hyperplastic MG thymus cells gave significantly higher and more consistent responses to AChR than parallel cultures of autologous blood cells, whereas responses to PPD showed an opposite trend. Thus there was a preferential localization of AChR-reactive T cells in the hyperplastic MG thymus. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between blood and thymus cell responses to PPD (but not to AChR), arguing that the hyperplastic MG thymus contains a sample of sensitized peripheral T cells. By contrast, both AChR- and PPD-responsive T cells were almost undetectable in thymus from nonmyasthenic patients, which is evidently much less receptive to circulating T cells. Cells from MG thymomas showed the highest stimulations by AChR but did not consistently react to PPD. However, the uninvolved thymus adjacent to these thymomas behaved almost identically to the hyperplastic samples described above. Our interpretation is that AChR-specific T cells are initially sensitized in the MG thymoma but are selectively trapped in the hyperplastic thymus after being primed elsewhere. ",297,1
"Myeloproliferative disorders. Classification and diagnostic features with special emphasis on chronic myelogenous leukemia and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. Leukocytosis, mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and panhyperplasia in the marrow characterize the early stages of most of the CMPD, whereas extramedullary hematopoiesis (such as in the spleen or liver), peripheral cytopenias (anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia), and myelofibrosis, with or without osteosclerosis, reflect the changes seen in the later stages. Transitions among the different CMPD and termination in acute leukemia or marrow failure also are common. CML often is characterized by leukocytosis and the presence of the entire spectrum of granulocytes (mature and immature) in the blood and marrow, reduced LAP, hypercellularity with prominent granulocytic hyperplasia in the marrow, Ph chromosome, and bcr-abl gene rearrangement. Typical features of AMM include leukoerythroblastosis, teardrop poikilocytosis, anemia, increased or normal LAP, prominent megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the marrow, dyshematopoiesis, and hyperplastic or fibrotic/sclerotic marrow.

"Prospective study of the frequency and size distribution of polyps missed by colonoscopy. An important determinant in interpreting the results of colorectal polyp chemoprevention trials is the rate of polyps missed during colonscopic examination. We prospectively examined 90 patients by tandem colonoscopy performed by two alternating examiners. In 69 (76.7%) patients, 221 neoplastic lesions were documented histologically. Of a total of 58 lesions detected in 31 patients, no neoplastic lesion greater than or equal to 10 mm in size was missed; 16% of diminutive (less than or equal to 5 mm) neoplastic polyps and 12.3% of medium-sized (6-9 mm) neoplastic polyps were missed by the first examiner. We conclude that an experienced colonoscopist will miss about 15% of colorectal neoplastic polyps less than 10 mm in size in the setting of adequate bowel preparation. Large (greater than or equal to 10 mm) polyps were rarely missed, however, with the ""miss"" rate in our study equal to 0, with a 95% confidence limit of 4.64%.",249,1
"Differential effects of sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide on growth and secretion of cultured human endocrine tumor cells. Advanced gastrointestinal endocrine tumors respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy. In this study we examined the effects of two agents that promote cellular differentiation, sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide, on the in vitro growth and secretory responses of a human pancreatic carcinoid (BON) and human gastrinoma (PT-2 and PT-SM) cell lines that have been established in our laboratory. We found that both sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide strongly inhibited growth of BON, PT-2, and PT-SM cells. With continuous exposure of BON cells to sodium butyrate (2 mmol/L), the doubling time was prolonged, from 60 hours in controls to 156 hours, and saturation density was reduced to 28% that of controls. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (4 mmol/L) reduced saturation density to 37% that of controls in BON cells and prolonged the doubling time, from 60 hours to 103 hours. Antiproliferative effects of similar magnitudes were observed in the gastrinoma cell lines. In contrast, differential effects were produced on amine biosynthesis in BON cells; sodium butyrate stimulated levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the cells, whereas hexamethylene bisacetamide caused a profound dose-dependent inhibition of amine biosynthesis. The significant antiproliferative activity of sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide and the inhibitory effects of hexamethylene bisacetamide on amine biosynthesis warrant evaluation of these agents or analogues for treatment of metastatic carcinoid and gastrinoma.",344,1
"Choledochotomy for calculous disease in the elderly. To determine the risk of operations on the biliary tract in the elderly, we retrospectively examined 56 patients 80 years of age or older undergoing choledochotomy for calculous disease and compared their outcomes with those of a contemporary group of 257 patients undergoing similar surgery. Thirty of 56 elderly patients (54%) required urgent surgery for acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, or obstructive jaundice (serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dL), compared with 97 of 257 younger patients (38%) (p = 0.029). Mortality in elderly patients was significantly higher (5 of 56) than in younger (6 of 257) patients (p = 0.015). In three of the five patients who died, urgent surgery was performed for obstructive jaundice, reflecting the higher mortality experienced by jaundiced patients in the entire series (9.4%). Biliary cultures grew organisms in 25 of 27 elderly patients (93%). This is in contrast to findings of bactibilia in 62 of 118 patients (53%) under the age of 80 (p = 0.001). Similarly, preoperative blood cultures were positive more often in elderly (63%) than in younger patients (26%) (p = 0.007). Mean postoperative hospital recovery was longer in the elderly group (16.2 +/- 8.5 days) than in the younger group (12.2 +/- 9.3 days) (p = 0.002). In conclusion, elderly patients, particularly those with obstructive jaundice, are at higher risk for complicated biliary tract disease necessitating choledochotomy. They appear to be more susceptible to bactibilia and bacteremia, and require longer hospital recovery than younger patients.",406,0
"Epidural morphine for analgesia after caesarean section: a report of 4880 patients This retrospective study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of epidural morphine in providing analgesia following Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. The morphine was administered as a single bolus, following delivery, in doses ranging from 2 to 5 mg. The charts of 4880 Caesarean sections, performed on 4500 patients, were reviewed. The duration of analgesia and the occurrence of any symptoms which might be side-effects of the epidural morphine were recorded. The duration of analgesia was 22.9 +/- 10.1 hr and was not correlated with the dose of epidural morphine. Eleven per cent of the patients required no supplemental analgesia during the first 48 hr. Twelve patients (0.25 per cent) had respiratory rates less than 10 breaths per minute, on at least one occasion. No serious sequelae resulted from these periods of bradypnoea. Pruritus occurred in 58 per cent of patients, nausea and vomiting in 39.9 per cent and dizziness in ten per cent. Herpes simplex labialis was recorded in 3.5 per cent of patients. Epidural morphine is thus confirmed as an effective analgesic technique post-Caesarean section with 3 mg being the optimal dose. Even in this young healthy patient population, clinically detectable respiratory depression occurs so clinical respiratory monitoring is indicated.",308,0

"Platelet thromboxane release and delayed cerebral ischemia in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and associated thromboxane B2 release were studied in 52 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to detect a possible association between altered platelet function and development of cerebral ischemic complications after SAH. Compared to the values on admission, the patients showed significantly increased platelet aggregability (p less than 0.05) and thromboxane release (p less than 0.001) 1 to 2 weeks after SAH. The highest values of thromboxane release were seen in patients who deteriorated due to delayed cerebral ischemia with a permanent neurological deficit. Thromboxane release was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) before the onset of severe delayed ischemia in six patients with preoperative ischemia compared to the patients without delayed ischemia. In five others, both ischemic deterioration and elevated thromboxane release occurred after operation. These patients had preoperative values similar to the values in those without ischemic symptoms. The observations suggest that increased platelet aggregability and thromboxane release are associated with delayed cerebral ischemia both before and after surgery.",242,0

"Kinetic abnormalities of the red blood cell sodium-proton exchange in hypertensive patients. The present study was designed to examine the kinetics of Na(+)-H+ exchange in red blood cells of normotensive and hypertensive subjects and its relation to the previously reported abnormalities in Na(+)-Li+ exchange. The Na(+)-H+ antiporter activation kinetics were studied by varying cell pH and measuring net Na+ influx (mmol/l cell x hr = units) driven by an outward H+ gradient. The Na(+)-Li+ exchange was determined at pH 7.4 as sodium-stimulated Li+ efflux. Untreated hypertensive patients (n = 30) had a higher maximal rate of Na(+)-Li+ exchange (0.43 +/- 0.05 versus 0.26 +/- 0.02 units, p less than 0.0003), a higher maximal rate of Na(+)-H+ exchange (62.3 +/- 6.2 versus 47 +/- 4 units; p less than 0.02), but a similar affinity for cell pH compared with normotensive subjects (n = 46). The cell pH activation of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter exhibited a lower Hill coefficient than that of normotensive subjects (1.61 +/- 0.12 versus 2.56 +/- 0.14; p less than 0.0001). This index of occupancy of internal H+ regulatory sites was found reduced in most of the hypertensive patients (73%) whether their hypertension was untreated or treated. Hypertensive patients with Na(+)-Li+ exchange above 0.35 units (0.68 +/- 0.057 units, n = 16) did not exhibit elevated maximal rates of Na(+)-H+ exchange (57.3 +/- 10 units, NS) in comparison with those with Na(+)-Li+ exchange below 0.35 units (66.4 +/- 7.6 units, n = 26), but both groups exhibited reduced Hill coefficients. Hypertensive patients with enhanced Na(+)-H+ exchange activity (more than 90 units) had normal maximal rates of Na(+)-Li+ exchange.",475,0
"Transcranial Doppler determination of cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing CPR: methodology and preliminary findings. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To correlate cerebral arterial blood velocity measurements as determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound with various resuscitation maneuvers performed in an uncontrolled manner in a series of cardiac arrest patients undergoing standard resuscitation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Any patient undergoing resuscitation for a nontraumatic cardiac arrest was eligible for the study. INTERVENTIONS: Resuscitation was carried out while flow velocities were monitored in various intracranial arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Vessel identification was based on the angle and depth of insonation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The internal carotid artery was located more consistently than either middle cerebral or ophthalmic arteries and provided superior waveforms for analysis. Alterations in flow velocity were noted and correlated to various therapeutic interventions. Flow velocities were 70% of normal during the early phase of resuscitation but deteriorated over time until there was no evidence of net forward flow. Even early in CPR, flow was demonstrated only during systole. CONCLUSION: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound appears to be a potentially promising means of determining cerebral flow in patients undergoing CPR.",221,0
"Dietary fats and oils in cardiac arrhythmia in rats. The effect of long-term feeding of various dietary fats and oils on cardiac arrhythmia was studied in an animal model of sudden cardiac death. After confirmation that a dietary supplement of saturated animal fat (SF) increased the animals' susceptibility to develop cardiac arrhythmia under ischemic stress whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids of sunflower seed oil (SSO) reduced this susceptibility, we found that diets supplemented with either chemically refined palm oil (PO-I) or physically refined palm oil (PO-II) gave results that were generally intermediate in value between the SF and the SSO groups. However, during reperfusion of a previously ischemic heart, both PO-I- and PO-II-supplemented diets appeared to be as effective as SSO in reducing ventricular premature beats. In addition, the incidence of animals displaying severe ventricular fibrillation was much less after palm-oil feeding than it was after SF feeding. These preliminary results warrant further investigation of the potential antiarrhythmic effects of commercial palm oil. ",208,0

The overall prevalence was 10.5% in men and 9.5% in women, a sex ratio close to one and a higher duodenal:gastric ratio than previously reported from this region. A substantial 1% prevalence of asymptomatic ulcers was also observed.",169,0
"Trichothiodystrophy with chronic neutropenia and mild mental retardation. Trichothiodystrophy is a feature of several diseases that consist of characteristic hair shaft abnormalities and a wide spectrum of other developmental defects. Detection of sulfur-deficient hairs identifies this disorder and separates it from other similar ectodermal dysplasias with normal sulfur content. Detection of low sulfur hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling, because the disease appears to be an autosomal recessive trait. We report a patient with chronic neutropenia, mild mental retardation, and low sulfur content in hair. Our case expands the spectrum of disorders associated with trichothiodystrophy. ",130,0
"Isolated trigeminal sensory loss secondary to a distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm: case report. A previously healthy 25-year-old woman suddenly developed right-sided facial numbness and a headache. The neurological examination was within normal limits with the exception of meningismus and right-sided facial sensory loss. A computed tomographic scan and a magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated an acute hematoma in the right cerebellopontine angle. A 4-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed no abnormalities. Posterior fossa exploration disclosed a large, partially thrombosed, fusiform anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which indented the pons at the trigeminal root entry zone. The aneurysm was excised, and the patient made an excellent recovery. She was left with a persistent trigeminal sensory deficit. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms are rare lesions that generally present with a cerebellopontine angle syndrome; occasionally, facial sensory loss is also a feature. Isolated trigeminal sensory findings, as illustrated in this case, are extremely unusual in posterior fossa vascular lesions.",215,0
"Babbling in the manual mode: evidence for the ontogeny of language. Infant vocal babbling has been assumed to be a speech-based phenomenon that reflects the maturation of the articulatory apparatus responsible for spoken language production. Manual babbling has now been reported to occur in deaf children exposed to signed languages from birth. The similarities between manual and vocal babbling suggest that babbling is a product of an amodal, brain-based language capacity under maturational control, in which phonetic and syllabic units are produced by the infant as a first step toward building a mature linguistic system. Contrary to prevailing accounts of the neurological basis of babbling in language ontogeny, the speech modality is not critical in babbling. Rather, babbling is tied to the abstract linguistic structure of language and to an expressive capacity capable of processing different types of signals (signed or spoken). ",175,0
"Nurse-monitored cardiac recovery: a description of the first 8 weeks. Health problems and related patient management during early recovery after cardiac surgery are not well documented. As part of a larger study of recovery from cardiac surgery 75 patient-care giver pairs received telephone calls from nurses at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after discharge for the purpose of intervening to facilitate early recovery at home. After each call, nurses recorded detailed notes on the patients' progress and concerns. Content analysis of detailed nurses' recordings revealed the following predominant nursing actions: assessment, provision of support, reinforcement of predischarge teaching, referrals, and teaching. The five nursing diagnoses that occurred most frequently across the 8-week recovery period were altered comfort: pain; ineffective coping, individual; activity intolerance; sleep pattern disturbance; and altered nutrition. In response to these problems, patients managed and prevented health-related problems and engaged in health promotional and normalizing activities. By anticipating common problems in recovery, patients and care givers can be better prepared for going home. Similarly nurses can be better prepared to anticipate and respond to common recovery problems.",236,0

This methodology provides the spatiotemporal relationship of cerebral structure and function necessary to identify seizure onset and propagation in human limbic system epilepsy. ",115,0
"Protective effect of a novel calcium blocker, S-312-d, on ischemic acute renal failure in rat. The effect of the calcium blocker S-(+)-methyl 4,7-dihydro-3-isobutyl-6-methyl-4-(3-nitro-phenyl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridine- 5-carboxylate (S-312-d) on ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) was studied in rats. Ischemic ARF was induced by temporary (30-60 min) clamping of the left kidney 2 weeks after contralateral right nephrectomy. Plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance, urinary osmolality and fractional excretion of sodium were used to test the effectiveness of the drug. S-312-d (0.01-0.1 mg/kg b.wt. i.v.) administration before ischemia offered dose-dependent protection against the functional impairment induced by ischemia. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the survival rate of ischemic rats. S-312-d given after ischemia was not effective. The renal cortical edema induced by ischemia was significantly reduced by pretreatment with S-312-d. The increase in renal tissue calcium content observed after ischemia was also suppressed by S-312-d. Comparison with other established calcium blockers indicated S-312-d to be a good candidate for protection against ischemic ARF. These findings indicate that S-312-d may be clinically useful against renal ischemia.",318,0
"Long-term evaluation of hemiparkinsonian monkeys after adrenal autografting or cavitation alone. Autografts of adrenal medulla were implanted into preformed cavities in the caudate nuclei of four rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Five other hemiparkinsonian monkeys underwent caudate cavitation, but received no tissue implant. All of the animals had marked bradykinesia of the affected arm and stable apomorphine-induced turning before cavitation or implantation. Moderate behavioral recovery was seen in all five monkeys with cavitation and two of the three monkey with long-term adrenal autografts (the fourth adrenal recipient was sacrificed 10 days after grafting). The improvement occurred months after the procedure and was not as early or as complete as that seen after fetal dopaminergic grafts. Surviving adrenal tissue was found only in the animal that showed no behavioral recovery. The other two adrenal autograft recipients (with no surviving adrenal medulla) and all of the animals with cavitation had ingrowth of dopaminergic fibers from the area olfactoria and nucleus accumbens into the caudate, oriented toward the cavity. These findings show that the mechanism of improvement after adrenal medullary implants for parkinsonism is not dopamine secretion by chromaffin cells, but may be related to the sprouted host fibers. The results also indicate that the limited recovery after adrenal implants in parkinsonian patients may be a result of the cavitation, and not necessarily the result of tissue implantation.",320,0
"High ethanol consumption as risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage in young and middle-aged people. We examined the prevalence of high ethanol intake, hypertension, and other risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in a case-control study of 24 young and middle-aged patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. We recorded ethanol consumption, history of hypertension, liver disease, cigarette smoking, and mild or severe coagulation disorder in each case of intracerebral hemorrhage and in 48 control patients matched by sex and age. In univariate matched analyses, the frequencies of high ethanol intake (p = 0.009), hypertension (p = 0.05), and coagulation disorder (p = 0.05) were higher in the cases than in the controls. After controlling for possible confounding factors, we found that high ethanol intake and hypertension were the only independent risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05, respectively). The hemorrhagic lesion found in cases with a high ethanol intake tended to be located in the cerebral lobes (p = 0.01), contrasting with the typical basal ganglia location of hypertensive hematomas (p = 0.009). We conclude that chronic, high ethanol intake should be considered as an important risk factor for lobar hematomas in young and middle-aged people.",282,0
"Long-term follow-up of patients with recurrent malignant gliomas treated with adjuvant adoptive immunotherapy. Between August 1986 and October 1987, the Denver Brain Tumor Research Group conducted a clinical trial using autologous human recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-activated lymphocytes to treat 20 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas. The trial involved surgical resection and/or decompression followed by intracavitary implantation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and autologous stimulated lymphocytes (ASL) along with rIL-2 in a plasma clot. One month later, stimulated lymphocytes and rIL-2 were infused through a Rickham reservoir attached to a catheter directed into the tumor bed. The LAK cells were rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 4 days; the ASL were lectin- and rIL-2-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured for 10 days. Of the 20 patients treated, 11 were evaluated as a group (mean age, 44 years, range, 15-61 years; mean Karnofsky rating, 69, range, 50-100; mean Decadron dose at entry, 14 mg/d, range, 0-32). The average number of lymphocytes implanted was 7.6 x 10(9) (range, 1.9-27.5 x 10(9], together with 1 to 4 x 10(6) U of rIL-2. To date, 10 of the 11 patients died, all from recurrent tumor growth. The median overall survival time was 63 weeks (range, 36-201; mean, 86). The median survival time after immunotherapy was 18 weeks (range, 11-151; mean, 39). No significant difference in survival after immunotherapy was found between those patients who had received previous chemotherapy and those who had not. The use of steroids or prior chemotherapy did not influence the in vitro generation of ASL or LAK cells.",446,1
"Bactericidal effect of doxycycline associated with lysosomotropic agents on Coxiella burnetii in P388D1 cells. There is no consistently reliable treatment for endocarditis resulting from chronic Coxiella burnetii infection, the causative agent of Q fever. Although certain antibiotics are recommended on the basis of their in vitro bactericidal activities, results of therapy with these antibiotics are often disappointing. To evaluate whether the currently recommended antibiotic susceptibility tests for C. burnetii give misleading results because of continued division of uninfected cells, thereby resulting in the dilution of infected cells and, hence, a false picture of antibiotic efficacy, we blocked cell division during antibiotic susceptibility testing with cycloheximide. Using this new method, we found that the currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of Q fever, doxycycline, pefloxacin, and rifampin, did not reduce the ratio of infected to noninfected cells (either L929 or P388D1) by 9 days postinfection. To test the hypothesis that this lack of antibacterial activity is due to antibiotic inactivation by the low pH of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is found, we used alkalinizing lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine or amantadine) concurrently with doxycycline. This resulted in the sterilization of C. burnetii infection in P388D1 cells. This finding seems to confirm our suspicion that the acidic conditions of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is located inhibit antibiotic activity. This inhibition can be reversed in vitro when lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents are used.",333,1
"The site of recurrent duodenal ulcer. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the site of recurrent duodenal ulcer in relation to the site of the index ulcer. One hundred and thirty-five patients who had recurrent duodenal ulcer after documented healing of an index ulcer were studied. The recurrent ulcer was more likely to occur in the anterior bulb if the index ulcer was anterior (35 of 58 = 60%) than if the index ulcer was not anterior (29 of 77 = 38%, p less than 0.01). However, the likelihood of a recurrent ulcer on the posterior wall of the bulb was not significantly different whether the index ulcer was posterior (11 of 36 = 31%) or not (22 of 99 = 22%, p less than 0.24). Three of 20 patients (15%) who initially presented with bleeding bled again with their recurrent ulcers, compared with eight of 115 patients (7%) who first presented with dyspepsia only (p = 0.39). Thirteen patients were assessed independently by two endoscopists to determine ulcer site. Their assessments concurred for 12 (92%).",254,0
"Peripheral neuropathy associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. In 1989, the Centers for Disease Control recognized the existence of an epidemic illness characterized by myalgia and eosinophilia in individuals taking preparations containing L-tryptophan. We evaluated 3 patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome who presented with subacute progressive neuropathies. The neuropathies were predominantly motor and maximal in the lower extremities. Two patients were confined to a wheelchair and one was ventilator-dependent and bedridden. Sensory loss predominantly involved small fiber modalities. Electrophysiological studies showed multifocal marked conduction slowing and conduction block indicating segmental demyelination, with associated axonal degeneration that was accentuated distally. Examination of sural nerve biopsy specimens demonstrated axonal degeneration in all 3 patients and perivascular infiltrates in 2. Levels of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic metabolite of L-tryptophan, were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid in the 2 patients in whom it was measured. The cause of the neuropathy is unknown but may include immune mechanisms or toxicity of eosinophils, L-tryptophan, its metabolic products, or contaminants within L-tryptophan preparations.",243,0

"Prospective evaluation of clinical and pathologic detection of axillary metastases in patients with carcinoma of the breast. Complete axillary dissection was performed in 287 patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy between 1984 and 1987 to identify patterns of axillary node metastases, as well as discontinuous axillary node (""skip"") metastases. Positive pathologic findings were compared with preoperative clinical examinations in 266 patients and showed only 60 cases (22.6%) clinically suspicious for tumor, in contrast to 131 (45.6%) with pathologically confirmed positive lymph nodes. Axillary contents were classified level I, II, or III based on their relationship to the pectoralis minor muscle. An average of 24.2 nodes was resected per patient (level I, 10; level II, 8.1; and level III, 5.3). Tumors ranged in size from 0.5 to 12.0 cm (mean, 2.6 cm), and increasing tumor size was associated with an increased likelihood of positive nodes. The data on 204 patients with complete clinical and pathologic data show that of 119 patients with negative level I nodes a limited axillary dissection (level I only) would fail to identify 6 with positive level II and 2 with positive level III nodes, whereas of 85 patients with positive level I nodes limited axillary dissection would fail to identify 17 with positive level II nodes, 7 with positive level III nodes, and 27 with positive levels II and III nodes. Complete axillary dissection (levels I, II, and III) should be performed to stage patients accurately, as well as to remove tumor-involved nodes and diminish local axillary recurrences. Clinical examination of the axilla appears to be a poor means of identifying axillary metastatic cancer.",382,1
"Rhabdomyosarcoma. From the laboratory to the clinic. The prospect of identifying and developing new agents for treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas is discussed in the light of current prognosis for children with advanced stage disease. Preliminary attempts to identify tumor-specific agents using in vitro cell culture show potential promise, but as yet remain unproven. The more complex system of identifying therapeutically active agents using human tumor xenografts has demonstrated usefulness. The potential problems associated with this system are discussed.

"The effect of Ca and Mg supplementation and the role of the opioidergic system on the development of DOCA-salt hypertension. The effect of calcium and magnesium supplementation and the role of opioidergic system was examined in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. The rats were divided into four groups receiving standard laboratory rat diet (control group; n = 9); a calcium-rich diet with 2% CaCl2 added (Ca-group; n = 12); a magnesium-rich diet with 0.5% MgO added (Mg-group; n = 11); and a calcium and magnesium-rich diet with 2% CaCl2 and 0.5% MgO added (Ca/Mg-group; n = 11); each diet contained 7% NaCl. After four weeks on these diets, the rats were decapitated and blood was obtained for the measurement of plasma electrolytes, intraerythrocyte sodium, potassium and magnesium content (RBC-Na, -K, in mEq/L cells and RBC-Mg, in mg/dL cells) and plasma beta-endorphin concentration (beta-END, in pg/mL). In the control group, systolic blood pressure and RBC-Na were obviously higher than in the other groups. Plasma beta-endorphin concentration was 45.1 +/- 13.4 in the control group, 70.7 +/- 17.4 in the Ca-group (P less than .05 v control group), 58.0 +/- 20.1 in the Mg-group and 83.8 +/- 24.8 in the Ca/Mg-group (P less than .01 v control group). The blood pressure correlated significantly with both RBC-Na (r = 0.416, P less than .01) and beta-END (r = 0.436, P less than .005). A negative correlation was also observed between RBC-Na and beta-END (r = 0.437, P less than .005).",446,0
"Introduction: nutritional aspects of palm oil. The production, composition, and food uses of palm oil are outlined in this introduction to a detailed appraisal of the nutritional and health implications of the use of palm oil in the food supply. The putative role of dietary fats and oils in general, and of palm oil in particular, in the etiology of coronary heart disease and cancer is critically assessed. It is concluded that the evidence available is difficult to interpret unambiguously. Some evidence to suggest that the minor components of palm oil might have useful biological effects is also discussed. ",113,1
"Splenic septic emboli in endocarditis. The significance of septic emboli to the spleen is inferred by the frequency of septic emboli in general seen in patients with left-sided infective endocarditis who are referred for valve replacement. To determine the proper management of splenic infarcts and abscess due to septic emboli, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 108 patients with left-sided endocarditis who underwent valvular surgery at the University of Illinois Hospital from 1980 through 1988. Intravenous drug abuse was the etiology in 68% (n = 73). The incidence of splenic infarcts and abscess was 19% (n = 20), but an incidental finding of splenic infarcts was found in 38% (n = 11) of 29 asymptomatic patients who had computed tomograms. Streptococci and staphylococci were the causative organisms in 85% (n = 17). Localized findings were absent in 90% of splenic infarcts and abscesses. Abdominal computed tomograms were diagnostic of the sequelae of splenic septic emboli in 100%. No patient had intra-abdominal bleeding complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Splenectomy was performed in 50% (n = 10) of patients 3-24 days (mean, 11.2 days) after valve replacement. Indications for splenectomy included persistent sepsis in 60% (n = 6), large (greater than 2 cm) and peripheral lesions in 30% (n = 3), and splenic rupture in 10% (n = 1). Perioperative mortality of patients who underwent splenectomy was 30% (n = 3). The following conclusions can be drawn: 1) Splenic septic embolus is common in endocarditis. 2) Abdominal computed tomography should be performed for all patients.",412,0
"Morphological and histopathological aspects of aneurysms after patch aortoplasty for coarctation. Repair of coarctation of the aorta by synthetic patch grafting has been complicated by late aneurysm formation. These aneurysms differ macroscopically from atherosclerotic thoracic aortic dilatations. Specimens for microscopic examination were taken from 14 of 20 patients undergoing aneurysm resection. Histological analysis of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients (93%), foreign body reaction in 11 patients (78%), and intimal thickening in 3 patients (21%). The three layers of the aortic wall could be identified in the aneurysms. On the basis of these results, we discuss the etiologic factors and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of these aneurysms.",176,0
"Intradural spinal cord tumor presenting as a subarachnoid hemorrhage: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis. Negative findings on four-vessel angiography after a subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen in 5 to 30% of patients. A previously silent lesion in the spinal canal may be responsible for the ictus in a small percentage of this group. The etiological factors include tumors and arteriovenous malformations; however, investigations of such lesions have been limited to patients with signs and symptoms of spinal cord or nerve root pathological processes. This report describes the management of a 56-year-old woman with clinical findings typical of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on cerebral angiography, in whom magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed an intradural extramedullary cervical schwannoma. For this reason, cervicothoracic magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement should be considered as an adjunctive scanning examination in all patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on angiography.",204,0

"The management of the painful first metatarsophalangeal joint in the older patient. Arthrodesis or Keller's arthroplasty? We report a prospective randomised trial comparing Keller's arthroplasty and arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint for the management of symptomatic hallux valgus and hallux rigidus in the older patient. In 81 patients (110 feet), with a minimum of two years follow-up, both procedures gave a similar degree of patient satisfaction and symptom relief. The incidence of metatarsalgia was also similar. As there were no obvious advantages to arthrodesis, and since six out of 50 arthrodesed toes required revision, we suggest that Keller's arthroplasty is the better operation in these patients.",168,0
"Diagnosis of tracheal injury in mechanically ventilated premature infants by flexible bronchoscopy. A pilot study. Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is uniquely suited for the study of large airway lesions in the ventilated premature infant. However, no standardized clinical scoring system of distal tracheal injury exists and the adverse consequences of FB in ventilated premature infants are not well described. Using a prototype Olympus fiberoptic ultrathin bronchoscope with a directable tip and an outer diameter of 2.2 mm, we serially scored distal tracheal injury in conventionally ventilated premature infants on the basis of mucosal and obstructive changes observed at bronchoscopy. In addition, we prospectively evaluated the incidence of adverse cardiovascular and pulmonary effects during, immediately after, and within 1 h of FB. We performed 21 FBs in eight conventionally ventilated premature infants with birth weight of 1,239 +/- 438 g and gestational age of 30 +/- 3 weeks. The carina and mainstem bronchi were easily visualized in all infants using the prototype bronchoscope. During the first several days of life, moderate-to-severe distal tracheal mucosal injury occurred frequently, while moderate-to-severe obstructive injury occurred infrequently. Distal mucosal injury appeared to improve during the fourth week of life. Mild distal obstructive injury began to appear during the second week of life. Adverse consequences of FB observed in our patient population included transient hypoxemia and bradycardia during FB, changes in systolic blood pressure immediately and within 1 h after FB, and emesis immediately after FB. Serious adverse cardiovascular or pulmonary effects were not observed. We conclude that FB can be performed safely with appropriate monitoring and is a useful tool in the clinical assessment and serial evaluation of distal tracheal injury in ventilated premature infants. We speculate that moderate-to-severe distal tracheal mucosal injury may be associated with the development of later obstructive injury. On the basis of this preliminary study, further prospective investigations of tracheal injury in ventilated premature infants appear to be warranted.",409,0
"Final report of the French multicenter phase II study of the nitrosourea fotemustine in 153 evaluable patients with disseminated malignant melanoma including patients with cerebral metastases. One hundred sixty-nine patients with histologic evidence of disseminated malignant melanoma, including patients with cerebral metastases, were entered into a Phase II study of the nitrosourea fotemustine. The treatment regimen consisted of a 100 mg/m2 1 hour IV infusion every week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a 4- to 5-week rest period (induction therapy). In responding or stabilized patients, maintenance therapy consisted of 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks until the disease progressed. One hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for response. Three complete responses and 34 partial responses were observed (according to the World Health Organization criteria), leading to an objective response rate of 24.2% (95% confidence interval: 17.4% to 31.0%). Responses were also documented on cerebral (25.0%), visceral (19.2%), or nonvisceral (31.8%) metastatic sites. The median duration of response was 22 weeks (range, 7 to 80 weeks). The objective response rate in previously untreated patients was 30.7% (19 of 62 patients). The main toxicity was hematologic with delayed and reversible leukopenia and/or thrombopenia. The objective response rate observed (especially in untreated patients), the activity on cerebral metastases, and the small amount of extra-hematologic toxicity encountered suggest that fotemustine is an effective drug in disseminated malignant melanoma.",354,1
"Multimodality evoked potential testing in acute mild closed head injury. Multimodality evoked potential (MEP) testing, including brainstem auditory, visual, and somatosensory evoked potentials, have been reported to be useful in predicting outcome in severe closed head injury. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials have been demonstrated to be abnormal in 10% to 40% of acute mild head injury. A prospective study of 18 patients with mild closed head injury was undertaken to determine the usefulness of MEP screening within two weeks of the acute event. Long latency event-related potentials (P300s), in response to auditory stimuli with an oddball paradigm, were included in the screening. The subjects had several symptoms consistent with the postconcussive syndrome at the time of the evoked potential testing. Only one patient had an abnormal evoked potential response (greater than three standard deviations from the mean) from all the testing done. The standard methods of MEP testing were insensitive to quantifying the possible physiologic changes that are associated with memory deficits, lethargy, and emotional irritability after mild closed head injury.",220,0
"Parathyroid hormone-like peptide in normal and neoplastic human endocrine tissues. PTH-like peptide (PLP) is produced by tumors commonly associated with hypercalcemia as well as nonneoplastic tissues and several endocrine glands and tumors. To characterize the distribution of PLP in human endocrine tissues and tumors, we localized PLP in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique with polyclonal antisera. Among peptide hormone-producing tissues, PLP was identified in nontumorous adenohypophysis and pituitary adenomas; medullary thyroid carcinomas; normal, hyperplastic, and adenomatous parathyroids; adrenal medulla and pheochromocytomas; normal pancreatic islets; and endocrine tumors of pancreas, gut, and lung, including small cell carcinomas. In other endocrine tissues PLP was identified in nontumorous thyroid follicular epithelium, colloid nodules, and follicular neoplasms; normal adrenal cortex, adrenocortical adenomas, and carcinomas; nontumorous testicular Leydig cells; normal ovarian granulosa and thecal cells; an ovarian thecoma and a granulosa cell tumor; placental trophoblast; and decidua. These results demonstrate that PLP is localized in many normal and neoplastic endocrine cells, including those not known to influence extracellular calcium homeostasis. The presence of PLP in a variety of endocrine tissues suggests that it may play a local physiological role in the growth or function of endocrine cells. ",296,1

"Correlation of abnormalities of interictal n-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission tomography with focus of seizure onset in complex partial seizure disorders. Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) scanning with n-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) was performed on 23 patients with complex partial seizures undergoing long-term video electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure monitoring. Twenty-one of the 23 patients had abnormalities on SPECT scanning consisting of areas of decreased activity reflecting diminished cerebral blood flow. In 15 of these 21 patients, there was good correlation between the site of the abnormality on SPECT scan and the site of origin of seizures monitored by EEG. Of the six remaining patients, four had multifocal SPECT abnormalities, with one of the abnormal areas corresponding with an ictal site. The two remaining patients had SPECT abnormalities and major ictal EEG foci in entirely different areas. In contrast to the high proportion of abnormal SPECT scans, only 10 of 23 focal abnormalities were discovered on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Three patients who had seizures within 2 h of an initial scan were rescanned 4-5 h after injection. Focal areas of increased blood flow were noted on all three scans, although not always at the ictal site. The SPECT scan appears to be useful in interictal localization of seizure foci. Postictal scans may also be useful, although our numbers are too small to draw conclusions.",305,0
"A novel mechanical cardiac assist device for reversing left ventricular failure. Diastolic augmentation of aortic pressure is an efficacious means of improving coronary perfusion in heart failure. A novel mechanical cardiac assist device (MCAD), that has advantages over a conventional intraaortic balloon pump and left ventricular assist devices, has been developed. It consists of a high efficiency rotary solenoid, coupled to a pair of actuator plates that clamp on a shunt aortic graft section, and operates in a diastolic counterpulsation mode. The system has been evaluated in six anesthetized, thoracotomized dogs with myocardial ischemia. The MCAD was activated 30-40 min after coronary artery occlusion and synchronized with the R-wave. As illustrated by a representative sample of the data obtained from one of several trials, the preliminary experimental results demonstrated that the MCAD worked effectively to fulfill the primary functions of a counterpulsation assist device, i.e., augmentation of coronary perfusion and reduction in the vascular impedance to ventricular ejection.",199,0

"The effects of interleukin-6 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from human renal cell cancer. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are a heterogeneous population of T cells with potent antitumor activity against a wide variety of tumors. TIL from renal cell cancer (RCC) typically exhibit diminished growth and antitumor activity after four weeks in vitro. We have therefore investigated effects of varying doses of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (0, 25, 100 units/ml.) on in vitro expansion, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and expression of cell surface phenotypes of long term renal TIL cultures from three RCC patients. Among the various conditions tested, three of three TIL cultures displayed a mild increase in cell expansion when grown in IL-2 with the addition of 100 units/ml. of IL-6. Two of three TIL cultures grown in IL-2 and 100 U/ml. of IL-6 demonstrated enhanced proliferation as determined by 3H-thymidine uptake. TIL could not be isolated or maintained in vitro when grown in the presence of IL-6 alone without IL-2. IL-6 was also found to enhance the long term non-specific cytotoxicity against an allogeneic nonrenal tumor target. No consistent effect on autologous tumor-specific cytotoxicity was demonstrated. We conclude that IL-6, when used in combination with IL-2, may modestly enhance the long-term growth of RCC-derived TIL.",299,1
"Acute abdominal pain in the elderly. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidences of both specific diagnosis and surgical diseases in patients more than 65 years old who present to the emergency department with nontraumatic abdominal pain of less than one week's duration, and to determine the ED staff's ability to diagnose and triage elderly patients with acute abdominal pain. DESIGN: A 12-month retrospective review of all elderly patients who presented to the ED with acute, nontraumatic abdominal pain. SETTING: A regional trauma center serving a predominately rural population in the Midwest. The ED has 55,000 patient visits yearly. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 127 patients enrolled, 30 (24%) had no specific diagnosis made in the ED. Biliary tract disease (12%) and small bowel obstruction (12%) were the two most common specific diagnoses. Overall, 53 patients (42%) required surgery, usually during the initial hospitalization. In four cases, the postoperative diagnosis differed significantly from the ED diagnosis. Of the 74 patients (58%) who did not undergo surgery, 51 had follow-up information available. In 14 patients, the follow-up diagnosis differed from the original diagnosis, but most of these changes did not appreciably alter the treatment and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of surgical disease is high in elderly patients with acute abdominal pain, and ED staff are able to diagnose and triage these patients accurately.",305,0
"Prediction of risk in noncardiac operations after cardiac operations. To determine the preoperative variables affecting the mortality rate and the development of severe complications in patients who have had myocardial revascularization or a valve replacement and who then undergo a noncardiac operation, we retrospectively studied data from 120 such patients over the 5 years from 1982 through 1986. Thirty-six percent of patients had a noncardiac operation during the first month after the cardiac operation. The mortality rate was 11%, and the morbidity rate was 56%. The statistical comparison of the predictive accuracy of postoperative complications of three simple, widely used classifications (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, New York Heart Association classification, Massachusetts General Hospital cardiac risk index) demonstrated the superiority of the simplified three-class cardiac risk index (Massachusetts General Hospital-cardiac risk index; predictive accuracy of 84%). In a multivariate discriminant analysis of 21 variables in this population, five variables (myocardial infarction in previous 6 months, S3 gallop or jugular vein distention, arrhythmia on last preoperative electrocardiogram, emergency operation, delay between cardiac and noncardiac operation) were identified as being the most predictive of a postoperative complication. When these variables were used in the function (DF3) obtained by linear discriminant analysis, the prediction accuracy of a postoperative complication reached 83%. Performance of the new models in a prospective validation population remained satisfactory (75% for Massachusetts General Hospital-cardiac risk index three-class index and 72% for DF3). Extensive statistical analysis of our data tested by a validation study provided simple predictive models based on clinical variables easily available even in emergency situations.",351,0

"Fibrosarcoma of the head and neck. The UCLA experience. Between 1955 and 1987, twenty-nine patients with the diagnosis of fibrosarcoma of the head and neck were seen at the UCLA Medical Center. Follow-up ranged from 15 to 192 months, with a median of 66 months. Absolute 5-year survival was 62% (13/21). Five of 17 patients treated initially with surgery alone achieved local control and long-term survival. All five had low-grade lesions. Five patients received postoperative radiation therapy because of positive surgical margins. Three were rendered disease free, and all had low-grade lesions. Radiation therapy was used as primary treatment in six patients, four of whom received additional chemotherapy. Of these six, two are disease free with longer than 5-year follow-up. Surgery with and without adjuvant therapy successfully salvaged 42% (5/12) of the patients with local recurrence. Eighty percent (12/15) of the patients with low-grade lesions were ultimately rendered disease free vs only 8% (1/12) of the patients with high-grade histologic features. Seventy-two percent (13/18) of the patients with local recurrence were known to have positive surgical margins. Sixty-eight percent (13/19) of the patients with recurrent disease had high-grade lesions and/or tumor size larger than 5 cm. Tumor grade is the most important prognostic factor followed by tumor size and surgical margin status. Patients with low-grade lesions and adequate surgical margins are treated well with surgery alone. Patients with high-grade lesions or positive surgical margins should receive adjuvant treatment.",360,1
"Adenovirus colitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Adenovirus was identified in colonic tissue by transmission electron microscopy or culture in 5 of 67 (7.4%) homosexual men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (51 with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) with diarrhea. Colonoscopy showed the mucosa to be normal in 3 cases and mildly inflamed in 2. Light microscopy showed foci of mucosal necrosis that contained chronic inflammatory cells and degenerating and necrotic epithelial cells with amphophilic nuclear inclusions. By transmission electron microscopy, hexagonal viral particles characteristic of adenovirus were identified within the inclusions. Only 1 patient was concomitantly infected by a second potential enteric pathogen. It was concluded that adenovirus, an uncommon enteric pathogen in immunocompetent adults, causes intestinal pathology and may be associated with diarrheal illness in persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.",180,0
"Familial trigeminal neuralgia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Report of two families and review. Typical trigeminal neuralgia has occasionally occurred in multiple members of the same family over several generations. The clinical features of such cases, including the increased incidence in females, and the absence of other apparent hereditary, neurologic, metabolic, or structural abnormalities were identical to those of sporadic cases. More rarely, familial trigeminal neuralgia has been described in the setting of hereditary peripheral neuropathy, especially Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We describe patients from two different families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia. Both patients were successfully treated by percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis. The occurrence of cranial nerve symptoms in patients with demyelinating peripheral neuropathies is discussed in light of the current hypotheses regarding the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. ",186,0
"Cancer in the families of children with soft tissue sarcoma. The cancer experience among 754 first-degree relatives (mothers, fathers, and siblings) of a population-based series of 177 children with soft tissue sarcoma is reported. The current study represents an extension of our earlier work in which the authors found an excess of breast cancer in the mothers of 143 of these children. There were 40 cancers among all first-degree relatives, compared with 24.82 expected (relative risk [RR] 1.61, P = 0.006). There was no excess in fathers, but an excess of borderline significance was seen in mothers (RR 1.67, P = 0.0545), and a significant excess in siblings (RR 4.55, P = 0.0002), mainly due to carcinoma of the breast and pediatric tumors. Results of a step forward Cox multivariate analysis identified three variables in the index child which were independently associated with high cancer risk in relatives, as follows: age younger than 24 months at diagnosis; histologic type, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma or other and unspecified soft tissue sarcoma; and male sex. It was possible, therefore, to identify a subgroup of children whose relatives are at high risk of early onset cancer (RR in this group 10.14). The pattern of cancers is consistent with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The authors conclude that a marked proportion of childhood soft tissue sarcoma has a genetic basis.",324,1
"Endothelin family in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. To clarify whether endothelin may be present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, if it exists, to compare its molecular forms with those of endothelin in human plasma, we analyzed pooled human CSF and plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with specific enzyme immunoassays for each endothelin peptide. Of the four human endothelin peptides hitherto identified, big endothelin-1 was the major molecular form of endothelin present in human CSF. In addition, there was a small but significant amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in CSF, while endothelin-2 was not detectable. Similarly, big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 were identified in human plasma. Although big endothelin-1 was the most abundant, a substantial amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 was found in plasma with a resultant lower molar ratio of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1 than in CSF. In all CSF samples from 17 patients requiring diagnostic lumbar puncture or lumbar anesthesia, endothelin was detectable, with a preponderance of big endothelin-1 relative to endothelin-1 and endothelin-3. The mean concentrations of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in simultaneously collected plasma were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than those in CSF, while there was no significant difference between the mean big endothelin-1 concentration in plasma and that in CSF. There was no significant correlation among concentrations of big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 in each paired sample. These results indicate that endothelin is present in human CSF that is differently processed from endothelin in vascular endothelial cells and suggest a possible role for endothelin as a modulator of neuronal functions.",372,0
"Decreased operative risk of surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation with or without coronary artery disease. The consecutive 2 year experience with patients undergoing first-time surgery for mitral regurgitation with and without coronary artery disease was reviewed. From January 1988 to January 1990, 127 patients with pure mitral regurgitation undergoing first-time operation were surgically treated. No other valve lesion, no reoperation and no congenital defects were included. The mean patient age was 62 years with 26% of the patients greater than 70 years. Twenty-six percent of the entire group was in functional class IV. Seventy-five patients received mitral valve repair and 52 underwent mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude or Hancock valve. In patients undergoing mitral valve repair, there was a higher incidence of those greater than 70 years old and of coronary artery disease and in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement there was a higher incidence of functional class IV. The operative mortality rate was 2.3% (3 of 127 patients). No patient failed to be discontinued from cardiopulmonary bypass and all three deaths occurred after mitral valve replacement, with one from complications of chronic renal failure and dialysis. There was no significant difference in patients who either did or did not have a concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and there was no difference related to age or functional class. Postoperative complications occurred in five patients in the valve repair group, including recurrent mitral regurgitation in two necessitating reoperation, and in three patients in the valve replacement group. With newer operative and postoperative management techniques, especially preservation of the papillary muscle annular continuity, the risk of mitral valve surgery, particularly of valve repair, is considerably lower than in previous years.",355,0
"Aneuploidy in pancreatic insulinomas does not predict malignancy. Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy studies with paraffin embedded archival material from 14 pancreatic insulinomas were performed by flow cytometry. Clinical follow-up (2 to 17 years; mean, 8 years) was obtained for all patients. Half of the tumors had a normal DNA histogram and half exhibited an abnormal DNA profile consistent with DNA aneuploidy. Six of the seven patients with aneuploid tumors are alive and disease free (2 to 5 years postresection), and one is alive with metastatic disease. Of the seven patients with tumors showing normal DNA profiles, five are alive and disease free, one is dead of disease, and one is alive with metastatic disease. These data suggest that DNA ploidy analysis is unlikely to provide useful prognostic information for patients with insulinomas.",174,1
"Malignant melanoma occurring during pregnancy: a report of the Northern Israel Oncology Center (1968-1988). Medical records of seven patients treated within a 20 year period for malignant melanoma during pregnancy were reviewed. No significant detrimental prognostic effects could be attributed to pregnancy. The current literature on melanoma and pregnancy is discussed. Based on this, pregnancy seems not to be contraindicated in melanoma patients.",85,1
"Goal attainment scaling and outcome measurement in postacute brain injury rehabilitation. Relationships among two-month and final goal attainment scaling (GAS) scores, preadmission and final Portland Adaptability Inventory (PAI) scores, and work outcome for 16 graduates of a comprehensive, postacute brain injury rehabilitation program were examined. Final GAS scores were higher for program graduates who obtained the most desirable work outcomes, and preadmission and final PAI scores were lower for the successful program graduates. Final GAS scores were significantly correlated with other outcome measures. Preadmission PAI scores predicted work outcome, and two-month GAS scores predicted final GAS scores. Initial PAI scores distinguished between program successes and failures, but not between program successes and dropouts. A brief look at one case illustrates the modified application of GAS in postacute brain injury rehabilitation. Results of this study and case analyses support GAS as a quantifiable, individualized measure that is useful for (1) monitoring patient progress, (2) structuring team conferences, (3) ongoing rehabilitation planning and decision-making, (4) concise, relevant communication to family, referral sources, and funding sources, and (5) overall program evaluation when used in the context of other objective outcome measures. Although our results support the clinical utility of GAS, further study is recommended to assess the psychometric characteristics of GAS in this application.",272,0
"Long-term suppression of tremor by chronic stimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus. The usefulness of high-frequency stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) as the first neurosurgical procedure in disabling tremor was assessed in 26 patients with Parkinson's disease and 6 with essential tremor. 7 of these patients had already undergone thalamotomy contralateral to the stimulated side, and 11 others had bilateral Vim stimulation at the same time. Chronic stimulating electrodes connected to a pulse generator were implanted in the Vim. Tremor amplitude at rest, during posture holding, and during action and intention manoeuvres was assessed by means of accelerometry. Of the 43 thalami stimulated, 27 showed complete relief from tremor and 11 major improvement (88%). The improvement was maintained for up to 29 months (mean follow-up 13 [SD 9] months). Adverse effects were mild and could be eradicated by reduction or cessation of stimulation. This reversibility and adaptability, allowing control of side-effects, make thalamic stimulation preferable to thalamotomy, especially when treatment of both sides of the brain is needed.",237,0
"Central nervous system bioaminergic responses to mechanical trauma. An experimental study. Changes in biogenic amines in the brain and spinal cord following penetrating injury were studied in male Wistar rats using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Rapid increase in hemispheric concentration of these substances was noted beginning shortly after trauma. This trend continued until they were about three to four times control levels by about 24 to 48 hours postinjury. In the spinal cord, however, there was an initial sharp reduction in regional concentrations 2 hours postinjury followed by a slow rise thereafter. By 48 hours postinjury, levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin of the cords of injured animals were still less than those of nontraumatized controls. This variation in the central nervous system bioaminergic response with the level of injury raises questions as to its precise role in neurological damage following mechanical insult.",181,0
"A huge intracranial xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa: case report. Xanthogranulomas of the dura presenting with clinical symptoms are rare. We report here a case of a huge dural xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa, which caused hemiparesis through marked displacement and stenosis of the middle cerebral artery. Although such tumors usually arise in association with histiocytosis X or familial hyperlipoproteinemia, the present case was not associated with these diseases. ",100,0
"Tay-Sachs disease in Moroccan Jews: deletion of a phenylalanine in the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase. Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by defects in the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit gene. The carrier frequency for Tay-Sachs disease is significantly elevated in both the Ashkenazi Jewish and Moroccan Jewish populations but not in other Jewish groups. We have found that the mutations underlying Tay-Sachs disease in Ashkenazi and Moroccan Jews are different. Analysis of a Moroccan Jewish Tay-Sachs patient had revealed an in-frame deletion (delta F) of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons that are present at positions 304 and 305 in the alpha-subunit sequence. The mutation impairs the subunit assembly of beta-hexosaminidase A, resulting in an absence of enzyme activity. The Moroccan patient was found also to carry, in the other alpha-subunit allele, a different, and as yet unidentified, mutation which causes a deficit of mRNA. Analysis of obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families showed that three harbor the delta F mutation, raising the possibility that this defect may be a prevalent mutation in this ethnic group.",257,0
"Fibromyalgia in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Tenderness was assessed by point count and by scored palpation in 51 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as well as 51 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 50 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Fifteen of 51 (29%) patients with HIV infection met criteria for fibromyalgia, based on the presence of 10 tender (of 14) ""fibrositic"" points. Similar results were observed among patients with PsA (24%). The prevalence of fibromyalgia was higher among patients with RA (57%). Patients with HIV and PsA were less tender than patients with RA. Fibromyalgia in patients with HIV was significantly associated with myalgia and arthralgia, but not with age, duration of HIV infection, stage of HIV disease, or zidovudine therapy.",186,0
Job's syndrome: a rare cause of recurrent lung abscess in childhood. A clinical syndrome characterized by recurrent staphylococcal infection of the skin and respiratory tract from birth was described in 1966 and referred to as Job's syndrome. Marked hyperimmunoglobulinemia E was later found to be associated with this syndrome. This article describes a case of Job's syndrome as a cause of recurrent lung abscess during childhood necessitating lung resection.,93,0
"Visuospatial impairment in Parkinson's disease. We explored the nature of the visuospatial deficit in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its progression as a function of disease duration. We compared the performance of 183 patients with idiopathic PD and 90 control subjects matched for age and education on six visuospatial measures. We divided patients into three groups according to the disease duration: early (1 to 4 years), middle (5 to 10 years), and advanced (greater than 10 years). Performance deteriorated in five of the six visuospatial measures, as a function of disease duration. However, the pattern of visuospatial decline depended on whether dementia was present. The results were not influenced by age or anticholinergic medication. These findings support the presence of visuospatial deficits in PD patients, with a changing pattern of impairment related to dementia and progression of the disease.",182,0
"Assay of hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction and its relationship to pre-S- and S-encoded viral surface antigens. The polymerase chain reaction was evaluated as a diagnostic tool in 72 chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detectable in the serum of HBsAg-positive virus carriers using aliquots as small as 100 al. The detection limit for cloned hepatitis B virus DNA was 100 ag. Primer pairs for different regions of the HBV genome resulted in different sensitivity. Detection of the amplified hepatitis B virus DNA by Southern blotting and subsequent scintillation counting or densitometry allowed a semiquantitative assay. Using several primer pairs in parallel for optimal detection, all HBeAg-positive HBsAg carriers, 80% of HBe antibody-positive symptomatic HBsAg carriers and 57% of asymptomatic HBe antibody-positive HBsAg carriers were found to have hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum. During antiviral therapy hepatitis B virus DNA disappeared by the polymerase chain reaction assay in patients who became HBeAg negative, but polymerase chain reaction detected a relapse earlier than did the conventional dot blot. Pre-S antigens were assayed in serum and liver samples from most chronic carriers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or immunoblot. Although most viremic carriers were strongly positive for pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens, some hepatitis B virus DNA-positive HBsAg carriers did not have detectable pre-S antigens, and vice versa. Our data show that assay of hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum by polymerase chain reaction is by far more proficient than by dot blot and that it cannot be replaced by serological assays of HBeAg or pre-S antigen.",354,0
"The significance of gastrinomas found in peripancreatic lymph nodes. A patient with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) was found to have a solitary, extrapancreatic, extraintestinal gastrinoma in a peripancreatic lymph node. Preoperative studies did not show the location of the tumor. After excision of the gastrinoma the patient's fasting serum gastrin level dropped from preoperative levels of 596 pg/ml to 120 pg/ml (normal, less than 200 pg/ml). Fasting and stimulated gastrin levels have remained within the normal range at 18 months follow-up. This patient had previously undergone antrectomy, so it could not be determined if this tumor represented a primary lymph node gastrinoma or metastasis from an unrecognized tumor that may have been present in the resected stomach or duodenum. The outcome of this case confirms the previous reports that ZES can be controlled after resection of gastrinomas that were contained within abdominal lymph nodes, even if a primary enteropancreatic tumor is not found. Our results also support the use of an aggressive operative search aimed at eradication of the tumor in patients with ZES even if preoperative localization studies fail to identify the site of the gastrinoma.",259,1
"Left and right ventricular flows by Doppler echocardiography: serial measurements in patients with aortic regurgitation during exercise, cold pressor stimulation, and vasodilation. To test the practicality of Doppler echocardiography to measure serial change, biventricular outputs were measured in 15 patients with aortic regurgitation during control periods and during interventions of bicycle exercise, cold pressor stimulation, and vasodilation. Biventricular stroke volumes were measured in 10 normal subjects for validation of methods and differed by 2.8%. Reading errors were 3.7%. Signal quality improved between the first and last observation (p less than 0.05). Velocity signals were corrected for intercept angles, which averaged 12 and 19 degrees for right heart flows and 31 and 32 degrees for the left side of the heart in all subjects. Negative correlations occurred between intercept angles and the chronologic order in which the patients were studied for left (p = 0.02) and right (p = 0.05) flows. Mean flow areas varied 9% in the left ventricle and 20% in the right ventricle. Total variability for measuring flow determined from control values was 11% to 13%. When twice the variability was used as the detectable level of change, only exercise provoked real increases in biventricular flows in the majority of patients. We conclude that serial measurements of flow by Doppler echocardiographic methods had to exceed 20% to 25% to achieve significant change. Measuring intercept angle, resolving flow area, and learning are variables that need greater emphasis.",330,0
"Motion analysis of the cervical spine in athetoid cerebral palsy. Extension-flexion motion. Frequently instability and premature onset of spondylosis of the cervical spine are found in athetoid cerebral palsy (CP) patients. These structural abnormalities appear to be related to athetoid motion of the neck in CP. Through motion analysis, the authors aimed to clarify the abnormalities of cervical motion that could precipitate structural abnormalities. The gross characteristic feature of cervical motion in athetoid CP is ""whip movement."" Both velocity and acceleration during extension-flexion motion were greater than in normal subjects, especially at the upper cervical levels. Also, a sudden increase in velocity and acceleration occurred during rapid motions at certain levels, followed by a larger range of motion of the cervical spine. Such kinematic abnormalities were thought to generate a greater shearing force and bending moment exerted on the corresponding cervical articulations-discs and facets. Olisthetic instability often accompanied disc degeneration at the upper cervical levels. A large range of extension--flexion motion of the cervical spine, analogous to a cantilever, caused a repeated bending moment of extraordinary magnitude and was regarded as a precipitative factor for disc degeneration and osteophytosis common at the middle and lower levels of the disc.

"Multifocal colitis associated with an epidemic of chronic diarrhea. An outbreak of a chronic diarrheal syndrome was detected between May and August 1987 in rural Henderson County, Illinois. Seventy-two individuals were affected. Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak. Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation. Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40). Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism. Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content. Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal. Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients. Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles. After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea. One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years. We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis. This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea.",284,0
"Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus and HIV infection. We retrospectively reviewed six patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection treated between 1985 and 1988. All six patients were homosexual men. Five patients had AIDS and one was HIV-positive. The most common symptoms and signs were pain (n = 5), mass (n = 5), and bleeding (n = 5). The average tumor size was 3.2 cm with a range of 1-10 cm. Five tumors were located in the anal canal and one at the anodermal junction. One patient was treated with biopsy alone, one with local excision, one with wide local excision and radiation therapy, and two with diverting colostomy. The average follow-up was 8 months. Of the five AIDS patients, two died, one was transferred to a hospice facility, one was lost to follow-up, and one remains alive 1 year following treatment. The HIV-positive patient died secondary to metastatic SCCA. This group of patients raises the question of a possible association between HIV and SCCA.",241,1
"Dioxin-inducible, Ah receptor-dependent transcription in vitro. We have developed a homologous in vitro transcription system that requires (i) 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (called TCDD or dioxin), (ii) the Ah receptor, and (iii) a dioxin-responsive enhancer for activity. Unfractionated nuclear extracts from mouse hepatoma cells contain an inhibitor and fail to direct transcription in vitro. However, following phosphocellulose chromatography and reconstitution, the fractionated nuclear extract directs accurate transcription in vitro, using as a template the promoter/enhancer region from the mouse cytochrome P1-450 gene (Cyp1a1) linked to a ""G-free cassette"" (which generates a transcript with no guanosine residues). Extracts from TCDD-treated cells exhibit higher activity than extracts from untreated cells when transcribing a template containing both the promoter and enhancer but not when transcribing a template containing the promoter alone. Extracts from Ah receptor-defective cells fail to direct in vitro transcription in a TCDD-inducible fashion. A regulatory element that contains two binding sites for the liganded Ah receptor plus a truncated Cyp1a1 promoter suffices to direct TCDD-inducible, Ah receptor-dependent transcription in vitro. The inducible, receptor-dependent, enhancer-dependent properties of this system make it appropriate for analyzing in vitro the mechanism of dioxin action and the function of the Ah receptor.",304,1
"Cervical rotation flaps for midface resurfacing. The midface has long served as a focus for creativity in surgical reconstruction. Full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness grafts, and distal flaps have long been used to attempt to reduplicate existing anatomy in this area.

The cases we have done using this technique for the past 3 years are reviewed. Our present indications for use of these flaps and their limitations are given.",160,1
"SPECT quantitation of iodine-131 concentration in phantoms and human tumors. The validity of SPECT measurement of iodine-131 (131I) concentration was tested in vitro in phantoms and in vivo by measuring bladder urine concentrations. Phantom studies comparing known and SPECT measured concentrations showed a good correlation for 131I (r = 0.98, s.e.e. = 20.94 counts/voxel) for phantoms of 25 to 127 cc and concentrations of 0.13 to 9.5 microCi/cc. The in vivo, in vitro correlation of 131I concentrations in the urine was also good (r = 0.98, s.e.e. = 0.677 microCi/cc). Quantitative SPECT was used to calculate the effective half-life and dosimetry of radioiodine in 12 sites of thyroid carcinoma in seven patients. SPECT was also used to determine the dosimetry of [131I]MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) in two patients with carcinoid, two with neuroblastoma, and one with pheochromocytoma. The radiation dose for thyroid carcinoma metastases varied between 6.3 and 276.9 rad/mCi. The dose from MIBG varied between 13.4 and 57.8 rad/mCi. These results indicate the validity of quantitative SPECT for in vivo measurement of 131I and the need to measure the concentration of 131I in individual human tumor sites.",336,1
"The influence of age vs peak serum concentration on life-threatening events after chronic theophylline intoxication. To identify risk factors for the development of seizures and cardiac arrhythmias after chronic, unintentional theophylline intoxication we monitored the clinical course of 72 consecutive patients referred to a regional poison center with chronic theophylline intoxication (serum theophylline concentration, greater than or equal to 167 mumol/L after protracted use). The median age of the sample was 47.5 years (range, 4 days to 91 years). Median peak theophylline concentration was 239 mumol/L, with a range of 167 to 722 mumol/L. A life-threatening event (LTE) occurred in 28 patients (39%) that included seizures in eight and a major cardiac arrhythmia in 22. The median peak (theophylline) of patients who had an LTE vs those who did not was 235.8 vs 238.7 mumol/L. However, the median age of patients with an LTE compared with those without an LTE was significantly greater (70.5 vs 18.0 years). Stratification of data by chronologic age revealed a stepwise increase in the frequency of LTE with advancing years: patients more than 75 years old had a 16.7-fold greater risk of LTE than patients less than 25 years old (95% confidence interval, 3.56, 77.5) despite comparable intergroup median serum (theophylline). These data suggest the primary determinant of LTEs after chronic theophylline intoxication is chronologic age. Elderly patients have an inordinately greater risk of LTE than younger patients. Peak serum theophylline concentration cannot predict which patients with chronic theophylline intoxication will have an LTE. Finally, these data indicate that theophylline should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in elderly patients.",416,0

"The effect of age on treatment choice and survival in elderly breast cancer patients. To investigate the effect of age on treatment choice and survival in patients with breast cancer, data from the cancer registry of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) on 611 women have been analyzed. All patients 55 years and older admitted to the NKI for primary treatment of breast cancer between 1981 and 1986 were selected. For women 75 years and older, physicians were less likely to use treatment of adjuvant radiation therapy after a mastectomy and more often employed primary hormonal therapy only for local stage disease than for younger patients. Life-table analysis showed that disease-specific survival at 7 years for patients 65 through 74 years of age was significantly better (65%) than that of the youngest (55%) and the oldest age group (50%). In multivariate regression analysis (Cox), age older than 74 years was significantly and independently associated with a shorter disease-specific survival as compared with patients younger than 75 years. This difference in survival, however, does not seem to be the result of the difference in treatment between the age groups, but suggests an influence of age-related factors such as comorbid diseases and weak physical condition, which manifest themselves most strongly in the oldest age category and make the older woman more vulnerable to the course of malignant disease.",293,1
"Cutaneous horn of the penis: its association with squamous cell carcinoma and HPV-16 infection. Cutaneous horns of the penis are rare. Including this case, only 19 cases have been reported in the English-language literature. In 37% of the reported cases a malignant tumor was found beneath the cutaneous horn. Our case is remarkable because a stage I squamous cell carcinoma developed on the shaft of the penis of a neonatally circumcised man. Human genital carcinoma resulting from a multifactorial process in which ""promoting"" papillomavirus is an integral element is being increasingly reported.

"Impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry at myringotomy [published erratum appears in Pediatrics 1991 Jun;87(6):945] A total of 220 ears undergoing myringotomy and pressure-equalizing tube placement were studied with impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry in a direct comparison for detection of middle-ear effusion. Impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry were equally accurate, detecting the presence or absence of middle-ear effusion in 73% and 72% of ears, respectively. The presence of effusion in ears with tympanographic patterns other than type A and type B was not consistently and reliably predicted. The higher sensitivity of impedance tympanometry (90%) compared with that for acoustic reflectometry (58%) contrasted with the opposite findings for specificities (54% vs 88%). It is concluded that impedance tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry measure different events at the tympanic membrane and their utility lies in the fact that they complement each other. These instruments can aid the experienced otoscopist in confirming a clinical impression and assist the less experienced clinician in validating or improving otoscopic skills.",249,0
"Comparison of characteristics of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with head and neck cancer and those with gastric cancer. In ongoing reviews of 339 patients with surgically treated primary squamous cell carcinoma, there were 19 (5.6%) with concurrent gastric cancer and 11 (3.2%) with head and neck cancer. The incidences of intra-esophageal multiple occurrence of esophageal cancer are 27.3% and 26.3% in those with associated head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, respectively, and higher than 7.1% in those without such a concurrent cancer. There was no difference in the clinicopathological characteristics of those with concurrent head and neck and gastric cancers, except for the higher incidence of metachronous occurrence in the former. These findings suggest that, in cases of esophageal cancer associated with concurrent head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, intraesophageal multiplicity of the esophageal carcinoma is frequent and that preoperative serial evaluations is most important to design treatment and estimate the prognosis.",205,1
"Local recurrence and survival following nerve-sparing radical cystoprostatectomy. From March 1982 through July 1988, 76 men underwent nerve-sparing radical cystoprostatectomy for carcinoma of the bladder at our hospital. Of the 76 patients 2 (2.6%) had positive surgical margins (dome of the bladder and left ureter) and neither had positive margins at the site of nerve-sparing modifications. Of 3 patients (3.9%) who had local recurrence none had positive surgical margins. The 5-year actuarial local recurrence rate is 7.5%. Thirteen of 76 patients (17%) died of transitional cell carcinoma and 7 (9%) died of other causes, while 53 (70%) are alive without evidence of disease with a mean followup of 38.4 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rates are 64% over-all, 68% without disease and 78% disease-specific. Of the 42 evaluable men who underwent cystoprostatectomy alone 27 (64%) are potent, compared to 2 of the 12 men (17%) who also underwent urethrectomy. We conclude that the nerve-sparing modifications do not compromise cancer control, that local recurrence and survival rates are at least comparable to those achieved with standard radical cystoprostatectomy, and that it is possible to preserve potency in most men undergoing this procedure.",316,1
"Scalp pilomatrix carcinoma as an extra-axial mass. We report the CT, MRI, and angiographic findings in a case of pilomatrix carcinoma that had invaded the temporal bone and presented itself as an extra-axial mass. Even though bone destruction was better shown with CT, the tumor mass with its meningeal and tentorial extension was seen more clearly with MRI. The arteriogram demonstrated a unique vascular supply from the external carotid artery. ",93,0
"Interferon-alpha produces sustained cytogenetic responses in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and the course of complete cytogenetic responses in interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-treated patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. DESIGN: Two prospective trials in consecutive patients. SETTING: A major tertiary cancer center. PATIENTS: Ninety-six consecutive patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia with disease duration of less than 1 year. INTERVENTION: Patients received partially pure IFN-alpha intramuscularly, from 3 to 9 million U/d (51 patients) or recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (Roferon, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, New Jersey), 5 million U/m2 body surface area daily (45 patients). MEASUREMENTS: Hematologic and cytogenetic tests were administered. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy of the patients (73%) achieved hematologic remission (95% CI, 63% to 81%), and 18 (19%) had complete suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome on at least one cytogenetic test. A complete cytogenetic response was induced in 7 of 51 or 14% (CI, 6% to 26%) of the patients treated with the partially pure IFN-alpha and in 11 of 45 or 24% (CI, 13% to 40%) of the patients treated with recombinant IFN-alpha 2a. The difference in complete cytogenetic response between the two groups was 10.7% (CI, - 5% to 26%; P greater than 0.2). Eleven patients had durable, ongoing, complete cytogenetic responses from 6 to more than 45 months (median, more than 30 months). CONCLUSION: This study was the first to show sustained, complete cytogenetic responses in a subset of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with single-agent therapy. The nature of this remission, that is, whether it depends on continuous therapy, requires further study.",430,1
"Ganglioglioma: a clinical study with long-term follow-up. Gangliogliomas are uncommon tumors of mixed neoplastic glial and neuronal elements. Because of their low incidence, few large series exist that fully describe the clinical characteristics of patients afflicted with this tumor. We have reviewed the medical records of 20 patients at Duke University Medical Center with histologically proven gangliogliomas. These patients typically presented within the first three decades of life and their most common presenting symptom was seizures. Therapies included surgical resection, either partial or total, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up was achieved by chart review and by telephone interview. Patients who underwent gross total resection alone seemed to fare the best when comparing all treatment groups, and we therefore recommend this as the main form of treatment.",166,1
"Follicular neoplasms of the thyroid in men older than 50 years of age. A DNA flow cytometric study The clinical behavior of follicular neoplasms of the thyroid in elderly men can be difficult to predict on histologic grounds alone. To assess the usefulness of DNA flow cytometry in predicting the metastatic potential of these tumors, the authors studied 44 primary and metastatic follicular neoplasms of the thyroid by DNA flow cytometry of paraffin-embedded tissue. The neoplasms were obtained from 44 men ranging in age from 50 to 79 years (mean, 60). There were 29 follicular adenomas, 11 primary follicular carcinomas (neoplasms with capsular and/or vascular invasion), and 4 metastatic follicular carcinomas. Follow-up information was available on 40 of the 44 patients. The mean follow-up was 114 months. Twenty-five of the 29 follicular adenomas had a diploid DNA content, 2 (7%) were tetraploid, and the DNA histograms on 2 were not interpretable. All patients with follicular adenomas had no evidence of disease (NED) at last follow-up. Eight of the 11 primary follicular carcinomas were diploid. Six of these patients had NED, one died with carcinoma at 82 months, and no follow-up was available on one. Three (27%) of the primary follicular carcinomas were aneuploid or tetraploid. Two of these patients had NED, and the third died with carcinoma 84 months after diagnosis. Two of the four metastatic follicular carcinomas were diploid and two (50%) were aneuploid or tetraploid. One of the two patients with diploid metastatic follicular carcinomas died with carcinoma, as did one of the two patients with aneuploid metastatic follicular carcinomas. These results suggest the following: (1) follicular carcinomas are more likely to be aneuploid or tetraploid than are follicular adenomas; (2) follicular neoplasms without capsular or vascular invasion may include a small number of aneuploid or tetraploid tumors; and (3) DNA ploidy does not add to the prognostic value of histologic studies alone.",459,1
"Tracheoplasty for congenital long-segment intrathoracic tracheal stenosis. Congenital long-segment intrathoracic tracheal stenosis (CTS) is a rare life-threatening obstruction in infancy and childhood. From July 1983 to March 1988 six infants aged 14 days to 14 months with CTS were identified. Symptoms ranged from recurrent stridor and wheezing to severe respiratory compromise and hypercarbia. Routine chest x-rays were not diagnostic. Definitive diagnosis was made by bronchoscopy, which showed complete tracheal rings in all patients with severely compromised tracheobronchial lumens. In three patients, pericardium was successfully used for anterior tracheoplasty with one early death due to fulminant sepsis in an infant with undiagnosed sickle cell disease. The other two died late, at 3 and 9 months from problems unrelated to the repair. In three patients a rib graft was used for repair; in one, tracheoplasty was required after earlier repair of tetralogy of Fallot. All are late survivors with no postoperative symptoms. After recognition of CTS, prompt surgery is warranted to avoid the late complications of tracheostomy for long-term ventilatory support. Rigid repair with rib cartilage is preferable to use of pericardium. Proper rib harvesting with intact perichondrium, intraoperative bronchoscopy, oxygenation by cardiopulmonary bypass, and meticulous graft alignment are necessary for successful postoperative outcome.",296,0
"Mortality among workers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Evidence of radiation effects in follow-up through 1984 [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Aug 7;266(5):657] White men hired at the Oak Ridge (Tenn) National Laboratory between 1943 and 1972 were followed up for vital status through 1984 (N = 8318, 1524 deaths). Relatively low mortality compared with that in US white men was observed for most causes of death, but leukemia mortality was elevated in the total cohort (63% higher, 28 deaths) and in workers who had at some time been monitored for internal radionuclide contamination (123% higher, 16 deaths). Median cumulative dose of external penetrating radiation was 1.4 mSv; 638 workers had cumulative doses above 50 mSv (5 rem). After accounting for age, birth cohort, a measure of socioeconomic status, and active worker status, external radiation with a 20-year exposure lag was related to all causes of death (2.68% increase per 10 mSv) primarily due to an association with cancer mortality (4.94% per 10 mSv). Studies of this population through 1977 did not find radiation-cancer mortality associations, and identical analyses using the shorter follow-up showed that associations with radiation did not appear until after 1977. The radiation-cancer dose response is 10 times higher than estimates from the follow-up of survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, but similar to one previous occupational study. Dose-response estimates are subject to uncertainties due to potential problems, including measurement of radiation doses and cancer outcomes. Longer-term follow-up of this and other populations with good measurement of protracted low-level exposures will be critical to evaluating the generalizability of the results reported herein.",411,1
"Management of arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the forearm. We initially observed our patient, who had subcutaneous arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the volar forearm, until his wound demarcation was complete.

This is the first case report in the literature that describes a child with an arginine monohydrochloride-induced extravasation necrosis.",101,0
"The elusive colonic malignancy. A need for definitive preoperative localization. Colonoscopy with biopsy is the standard of practice for the diagnosis of colonic malignancies. Unfortunately, the inability of endoscopy to obtain precise distance measurements from the anal verge can make localization of lesions at operation difficult. For this reason, preoperative barium enema or intraoperative colonoscopy have been advocated to further pinpoint the sites of those lesions not thought to be easily located at operation. Five patients are presented in whom malignant lesions of the colon were diagnosed and verified histologically, but were later undetectable at operation or subsequent colonoscopic examinations. Four of these patients underwent laparotomy and three received colon resections. None of these patients' tumors were identified during intraoperative colonoscopy, in the resected bowel on pathologic examination, or on follow-up colonoscopy. A fifth patient is presented who spontaneously passed a polyp containing invasive adenocarcinoma, but multiple colonoscopic examinations have failed to identify the site of the lesion. To date, none of these tumors have recurred with periods of follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years. These patients demonstrate a poorly documented and little understood aspect of the behavior of colonic malignancies, i.e., the ability to spontaneously regress or slough from the bowel wall. Based on these instances, localization of potentially malignant colon lesions is recommended with submucosal dye injections at initial endoscopy or with colonoscopy in the operating room immediately prior to operation.",294,1
"Elective radical neck dissection in epidermoid cancer of the head and neck. A retrospective analysis of 853 cases of mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancer. A retrospective analysis of 853 patients with cancer of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx operated on over a 30-year period was performed. Four hundred fifty-seven of them had a radical neck dissection (RND) at some point. Five hundred ninety patients had no clinically positive nodes (N-o) necks at the time of primary treatment; 99 of these had elective neck dissection, whereas 95 others had a delayed RND when nodes became clinically involved. Twenty-three percent of all N-o patients had microscopically involved nodes and less than half of these were among those patients selected for elective RND. Furthermore, 58% of those patients who had elective RND did not have positive nodes. Comparative analysis of elective RND, delayed therapeutic RND after clinical appearance of nodes, and composite operations for patients with N1-N3 disease indicates little difference in disease-free survival when the nodes in the elective RND were positive microscopically for tumors (56%, 49% and 47% respectively). It thus seems that elective RND offers no real advantage over a careful watchful waiting approach in most patients.",270,1
"The internal oblique-iliac crest free flap in composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, skin, and mucosa. The reconstruction of oromandibular defects following ablative surgery is a challenging undertaking. When the defect involves skin as well as mucosa, the challenge becomes even greater. The internal oblique iliac crest osteomyocutaneous free flap is particularly useful for reconstruction of through-and-through composite defects due to the inclusion of two separate soft-tissue flaps on the same vascular pedicle. We report our experience with this flap in the reconstruction of 10 patients with such defects. The utility, and the limitations of this form of reconstruction are discussed in detail.",137,1
"High incidence of antibodies to HTLV-I tax in blood relatives of adult T cell leukemia patients. Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). Although the mechanisms of the leukemogenic process are unknown, the tax gene may have a role in this process. Because clustering occurs with HTLV-I and ATL, members of ATL families were examined for antibodies to the tax protein and compared with matched HTLV-I-positive blood donors. To investigate the antibody response to this protein, a plasmid, pBHX-4, was constructed to express a recombinant tax protein (r-tax). For ATL patients and their HTLV-I antibody-positive blood relatives, the rate of seroreactivity with the r-tax protein was 67.3% (35/52), compared with 51.6% (97/188) for HTLV-I antibody-positive control blood donors (P less than .05). The difference between direct offspring of ATL patients and matched HTLV-I blood donors was even greater (84.2% [16/91] vs. 44.2% [42/95]; P less than .005). Thus, tax antibody positivity in direct offspring of ATL patients may reflect differences in time or route of HTLV-I infection. Alternatively, it might reflect genetic differences in host susceptibility or virus strain.",305,1
"Tumor angiogenesis and metastasis--correlation in invasive breast carcinoma. BACKGROUND. Experimental evidence suggests that the growth of a tumor beyond a certain size requires angiogenesis, which may also permit metastasis. To investigate how tumor angiogenesis correlates with metastases in breast carcinoma, we counted microvessels (capillaries and venules) and graded the density of microvessels within the initial invasive carcinomas of 49 patients (30 with metastases and 19 without). METHODS. Using light microscopy, we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for factor VIII. The microvessels were carefully counted (per 200x field), and their density was graded (1 to 4+), in the most active areas of neovascularization, without knowledge of the outcome in the patient, the presence or absence of metastases, or any other pertinent variable. RESULTS. Both microvessel counts and density grades correlated with metastatic disease. The mean (+/- SD) count and grade in the patients with metastases were 101 +/- 49.3 and 2.95 +/- 1.00 vessels, respectively. The corresponding values in the patients without metastases were significantly lower--45 +/- 21.1 and 1.38 +/- 0.82 (P = 0.003 and P less than or equal to 0.001, respectively). For each 10-microvessel increase in the count per 200x field, there was a 1.59-fold increase in the risk of metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.12; P = 0.003). The microvessel count and density grade also correlated with distant metastases. For each 10-microvessel increase in the vessel count per 200x field, there was a 1.17-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34; P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS. The number of microvessels per 200x field in the areas of most intensive neovascularization in an invasive breast carcinoma may be an independent predictor of metastatic disease either in axillary lymph nodes or at distant sites (or both). Assessment of tumor angiogenesis may therefore prove valuable in selecting patients with early breast carcinoma for aggressive therapy.",492,0
"Peritumoral blood flow in intracranial meningiomas. Blood flow was measured in intratumoral tissue, the cerebral hemispheres and particularly in the peritumoral area of 12 patients with intracranial meningiomas using the stable xenon-enhanced computed tomographic scan. Tumor blood flow frequently showed a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement with high flow at the tumor periphery and a central area of hypoperfusion. Blood flow values were on average 28% lower in the peritumoral area than in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. In individual cases, blood flow values in the peritumoral edematous area were very low. These findings suggest that the hypodense area surrounding meningiomas does not solely represent vasogenic edema, but may actually represent tumor pressure ischemia.",151,1
"Mobile knee reconstructions after resection of malignant tumors of the distal femur. Limb-salvage surgery involving mobile knee reconstructions for malignant tumors about the distal femur is a desirable and achievable goal. With limb salvage, the survival rate does not decrease significantly, and the resulting function is superior to when an amputation plus a prosthesis are used. Immediate and delayed morbidity is greater after limb-salvage surgery than after amputation. However, with thorough preoperative planning, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as indicated, and an experienced team of surgeons, limb-salvage surgery can provide a mobile knee with excellent function in the vast majority of cases for patients with malignant tumors of the distal femur.

"Second-line platinum therapy in patients with ovarian cancer previously treated with cisplatin. In an effort to critically define the incidence and clinical characteristics of secondary responses to cisplatin-based therapy in patients with ovarian cancer previously treated with a cisplatin-based program, a retrospective review was undertaken of patients at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who received greater than or equal to two cisplatin/carboplatin-based programs. Eighty-two patients were identified who met the entry criteria of having had a cisplatin-free interval (CFI) of more than 4 months between the completion of their first regimen and the institution of a second cisplatin/carboplatin program. Of the 72 assessable patients (10 had no measurable disease, and a laparotomy was not performed to assess response), 31 (43%) responded, including 10 surgically defined complete responses (S-CRs). The overall response rates (and S-CR rate), based on duration of CFI, were 5 to 12 months, 27% (5%); 13 to 24 months, 33% (11%); and more than 24 months, 59% (22%). Twenty-nine patients (35%) received noncisplatin/carboplatin-containing treatments between the cisplatin programs. Patients without any treatment for more than 24 months from the completion of their initial therapy experienced a 77% (17 of 22) response rate and a 32% (seven of 22) S-CR rate. In conclusion, secondary responses to cisplatin/carboplatin-based treatment are common in patients with ovarian cancer who have previously responded to the agents and increase in frequency with greater distance from the initial therapy.",372,1
"Rheumatoid arthritis and comorbidity. Data collected from 288 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) indicated that 54% of respondents also reported other chronic conditions, and that 20% rated at least one of these other conditions as severe.

"Elevated alpha-tumor necrosis factor levels in spinal fluid from HIV-1-infected patients with central nervous system involvement. To assess the role of alpha-tumor necrosis factor in the pathogenesis of central nervous system involvement during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, we recorded clinical data and measured alpha-tumor necrosis factor levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from 45 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1, classified as group II/III (10), group IV A (5), group IV B (10), and group IV C-1 (20) of the Centers for Disease Control acquired immunodeficiency syndrome classification system and 42 controls. Alpha-tumor necrosis factor was above the limit of detection in only 3 of 15 sera and 3 of 15 cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients in group II/III and group IV A, whereas it was detected in 17 of 30 sera (p less than 0.05) and 22 of 30 cerebrospinal fluid (p less than 0.0002) samples from clinically more advanced patients (group IV B and group IV C-1). Alpha-tumor necrosis factor mean values were 21.5 pg/ml in sera and 50.0 pg/ml in cerebrospinal fluid from group IV B patients and 30.4 pg/ml in sera and 24 pg/ml in cerebrospinal fluid from group IV C-1 patients.",309,0

"Indications, timing, and optimal technique for diagnostic angiography and angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction. Emergency cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction (MI) have a continuing role in the thrombolytic era. Although thrombolytic therapy has revolutionized the treatment of MI, it has significant shortcomings: about 75% of patients with acute MI cannot be treated with thrombolytic agents, 25% of treated patients will have persistent occlusion of the infarct-related artery, 70% will have a residual stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, and 20% of treated patients will experience reocclusion. Cardiac catheterization identifies the coronary anatomy for mechanical revascularization and allows the unstable patient to receive special therapy, such as intra-aortic balloon pumping. Many large clinical studies have evaluated approaches to coronary angioplasty for acute MI. Deferred angioplasty has indisputable advantages over immediate routine angioplasty. Direct angioplasty without concomitant thrombolytic therapy has acceptable success and complication rates, so that it can be considered the treatment of choice for acute MI in centers with an angioplasty program if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated. Patients at very low risk may not require cardiac catheterization routinely before discharge, since their good prognosis cannot be improved by invasive evaluation and intervention. Emergency surgical revascularization is indicated in a very small percentage of cases.",281,0
"Squamous cell carcinoma of the anus and HIV infection. We retrospectively reviewed six patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection treated between 1985 and 1988. All six patients were homosexual men. Five patients had AIDS and one was HIV-positive. The most common symptoms and signs were pain (n = 5), mass (n = 5), and bleeding (n = 5). The average tumor size was 3.2 cm with a range of 1-10 cm. Five tumors were located in the anal canal and one at the anodermal junction. One patient was treated with biopsy alone, one with local excision, one with wide local excision and radiation therapy, and two with diverting colostomy. The average follow-up was 8 months. Of the five AIDS patients, two died, one was transferred to a hospice facility, one was lost to follow-up, and one remains alive 1 year following treatment. The HIV-positive patient died secondary to metastatic SCCA. This group of patients raises the question of a possible association between HIV and SCCA.",241,1

"Trends in basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma of the skin from 1973 through 1987. Major increases have occurred in the incidence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, as well as in cutaneous malignant melanoma during the period 1973 through 1987 in British Columbia. The greatest increases in basal and squamous cell carcinomas are on the head and neck. This indicates that exposure to sunlight is the major causative factor. The greatest increase in melanoma is on the trunk in men and on the lower limbs in women. The dramatic increases in nonmelanoma skin cancers in British Columbia, a relatively low sunlight area, suggest that major prevention programs are needed in areas that are not considered ""sunspots."".",157,1

"Early antibiotic treatment of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infections: clinical and serological study. OBJECTIVE--To find out whether a 10-14 days' course of antibiotics early in the course of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infections could reduce the severity and duration of the disease and whether the antibody response in patients with reactive arthritis associated with yersinia infection differed between those treated and those not treated with the antibiotics. DESIGN--Prospective multicentre trial in which patients were randomised to treatment or no treatment with antibiotics. Patients were seen at three and six weeks and three, six, nine, 12, and 18 months after their first visit. SETTING--Departments of infectious diseases in three hospitals in Linkoping, Malmo, and Stockholm, Sweden. PATIENTS--40 Consecutive patients who had had symptoms of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infection for less than four weeks. INTERVENTIONS--20 Patients were allocated to treatment with antibiotics and 20 patients did not receive antibiotics. All patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and four also received intra-articular steroid injections after at least six weeks' observation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Arthritic symptoms assessed clinically and by using Ritchies' index; blood measurements reflecting inflammatory activity; serum IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody titres; HLA tissue type. RESULTS--No difference was observed concerning duration of arthritis, grade of inflammation, and number of joints affected between patients treated and those not treated with antibiotics. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and haptoglobin, IgG, and IgA concentrations. All values had returned to normal within three months. No patient developed chronic arthritis, but sustained slight arthralgia occurred in three patients. The HLA-B27 antigen was found in 23 (58%) of the patients, and its presence did not affect clinical outcome. The IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses were similar in patients treated with antibiotics and those not treated. CONCLUSION--Short term antibiotic treatment has no beneficial effect on the clinical outcome of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infection.",432,0
"A cost-minimization study of cancer patients requiring a narcotic infusion in hospital and at home. We conducted a retrospective, non-randomized, cost-minimization study, from the perspective of the Ministry of Health, to compare the cost of managing cancer patients who required narcotic infusions, in hospital and at home. Our medical costs averaged $369.72 per inpatient day and $150.24 per outpatient day (saving $219.48 per diem, 1988 Canadian dollars), while narcotic costs were the same for any given patient in both settings. Sensitivity analysis showed that no reasonable changes in the quantity and cost of services reduced our savings by more than 50%. During incremental analysis, savings increased as more outpatient days were managed by our centre, from $0.00 for 318 days, to more than $500,000 for over 2000 days per annum. As this program has been extremely cost effective and preferred by our patients, other hospitals and central funding agencies might consider establishing a regional outpatient narcotic infusion program to reduce their costs.",232,1
"Systemic and renal production of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin in decompensated liver disease and hepatorenal syndrome. To assess the role of altered renal and systemic production of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin in the hepatorenal syndrome, urinary excretion of their major renal and extrarenal metabolites was measured in patients with compensated and decompensated liver disease, chronic renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome. Urinary excretion rates of all prostanoids (renal and extrarenal) were increased in subjects with liver disease compared with normal controls. Moreover, they were considerably higher in subjects with severe hepatic decompensation but good renal function compared with those with hepatorenal syndrome. In contrast, the excretion rate of all metabolites was reduced in patients with chronic renal failure. The excretion rate of all metabolites was markedly elevated during the early stages of hepatorenal syndrome and decreased in parallel with creatinine clearance. When corrected for creatinine clearance, there was a strong correlation between prostanoid excretion and serum bilirubin in subjects with liver disease; there was no difference, however, in the excretion of renal and extrarenal prostanoids between hepatorenal syndrome and severe hepatic decompensation. It is concluded that hepatic decompensation is associated with a progressive increase in prostanoid excretion but that changes in production of prostacyclin or thromboxane A2 are unlikely to be major factors in the pathogenesis of the hepatorenal syndrome.",288,0

"Effect of intravenous streptokinase on the relation between initial ST-predicted size and final QRS-estimated size of acute myocardial infarcts. Thrombolytic therapy has been documented to reduce acute myocardial infarct size. The previously established relation between initial ST segment elevation and final electrocardiographic (ECG) myocardial infarct size in patients without coronary reperfusion might therefore be altered by thrombolytic therapy. The effect of intravenous streptokinase on this relation was therefore studied in 73 patients with initial acute myocardial infarction who had participated in the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2). Patients who received streptokinase were considered as one group and patients who did not receive streptokinase as a control group. Final myocardial infarct size, which was estimated from the QRS score, was predicted from the admission standard ECG by previously developed formulas based on ST segment elevation. In the 40 control patients there was no change from ST-predicted to final QRS-estimated infarct size (median 17.7% versus 18.3%; p = NS). In the 33 patients in the streptokinase group, there was a highly significant decrease from predicted to final myocardial infarct size (median 21.9% versus 16.2%; p less than 0.0002). This decrease was found for both anterior (median 23.7% versus 19.5%; p less than 0.03) and inferior (median 21.9% versus 12.0%; p = 0.001) infarct locations. Multiple regression analysis adjusting for differences in predicted infarct size confirmed the significance of streptokinase on the difference in infarct size (p = 0.006). Based on the variability of the percent change from predicted to final infarct size in the control group, a threshold decrease greater than or equal to 20% is required for identification of salvage.",402,0
"Mesangial cell accessory functions: mediation by intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Mesangial cell (MC) proliferation is an early pathologic alteration characteristic of many forms of immune mediated glomerulonephritis. The intracapillary position, contractile capacity, and production of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules place MC in a pivotal position to initiate, mediate, and direct glomerular damage. We as well as others have noted increased levels of cytokines including IFN gamma, TNF, and IL-1 and the cell surface MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules in the kidneys of mice with lupus nephritis. MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules are central to the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cells (APC). Since cytokines can increase both MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules, we investigated whether mesangial cells could function as APC or accessory cells after cytokine stimulation. For these studies we established a permanent MC line through transformation with origin-deficient SV40 DNA. Surface expression of ICAM-1 was similar in untransformed MC as well as SV40 transformed MC from normal mice and in untransformed cells from mice with lupus nephritis. Basal expression of ICAM-1 was upregulated rapidly by IFN gamma, TNF, and IL-1. MHC class II expression could not be induced with TNF or IL-1 alone but required prolonged stimulation with IFN gamma. MC adhered and presented antigen to an antigen specific IaK restricted T cell hybridoma. Anti-ICAM-1 mAb decreased adhesion and antigen presentation of cytokine stimulated MC. By comparison, MHC class II mAb abrogated antigen presentation by MC bearing MHC class II but did not block adhesion.",343,1
"Hypertension prevalence and the status of awareness, treatment, and control in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES), 1982-84 The prevalence rates of hypertension among adult (ages 18-74) Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, and Puerto Ricans were estimated using data from the 1982-84 Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). Hypertension is defined as diastolic greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, or systolic greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg, or currently taking antihypertensive medication. Among Mexican Americans in the Southwestern United States, 16.8 percent of the males and 14.1 percent of the females were found to be hypertensive. Among Cuban Americans in Dade County, Florida 22.8 percent of the males and 15.5 percent of the females were hypertensive. Among Puerto Ricans in the New York City area 15.6 percent of the males and 11.5 percent of the females were hypertensive. The age-adjusted rates are significantly lower than comparable rates for Whites and Blacks as measured in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), 1976-80. Control of hypertension in the HHANES populations fall short of the 1990 Objectives for the Nation established by the US Public Health Service 60 percent (34 percent controlled Mexican American hypertensives, 27.8 percent controlled Cuban American hypertensives, and 29 percent controlled Puerto Rican hypertensives.",329,0

The Jaeger-Hamby procedure was employed, with mandatory occlusion of the primitive trigeminal artery. ",75,0
"Blood pressure reactivity predicts myocardial infarction among treated hypertensive patients. High blood pressure (BP) defines a prognostically heterogeneous group. Because BP varies according to time, setting and means of observation, it has been postulated that BP reactivity might better predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) than does unidimensional measurements. To assess BP reactivity, the difference between pretreatment nurse (RN) and physician (MD) diastolic BP (DBP)--systematically recorded in that order--or MD-RN DBP, was obtained in 1737 previously untreated patients with sustained, RN BP greater than or equal to 160 and/or 95 mmHg. Patients stratified by tertiles of MD-RN DBP [(I) less than or equal to - 3, (II) -2 to 3 and (III) greater than or equal to 4 mmHg] were similar by sex, race, age, body mass index, cholesterol, electrocardiography, prior CVD, smoking and pretreatment or attained in-treatment BPs. During 14 years of followup, myocardial infarction (MI) incidence per 1000/year were, tertile I (3.2), II (3.7), III (7.6) (relative risk = 2.4, III vs I + II, p less than 0.05), whereas stroke incidence and non-CVD mortality were evenly distributed. By Cox survival analysis, controlling for other entry characteristics only age, sex and DBP reactivity remained predictive (p less than or equal to 0.03) of MI or total CVD. Thus, BP reactivity, probably a centrally-mediated phenomenon, identifies a subgroup of hypertensives with an increased propensity for MI despite successful BP control.",359,0
"Tumor necrosis factor regulates the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 receptors on human acute myeloid leukemia cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) acts as a potent enhancer of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- and interleukin-3 (IL-3)-induced human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) growth in vitro. We have analyzed the effects of TNF alpha on the expression of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors on AML cells. Incubation of blasts from seven patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/mL) and subsequent binding studies using 125I-GM-CSF and 125I-IL-3 show that TNF increases the specific binding of GM-CSF (30% to 280%) and IL-3 (40% to 600%) in all cases. From Scatchard plot analysis it appears that TNF upregulates (1) low-affinity GM-CSF binding sites, (2) common high-affinity IL-3/GM-CSF binding sites, and (3) unique (non-GM-CSF binding) IL-3 binding sites. The effect of TNF is dose dependent and is half maximal at a concentration of 100 U/mL, and becomes evident at 18 hours of incubation with TNF at 37 degrees C, but not at 0 degree C. The GM-CSF dose-response curve of AML-colony-forming units plateaus at a higher level in the presence of TNF, which indicates that additional numbers of cells become responsive to GM-CSF. Incubation of AML blasts with the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (protein kinase C activators) does not influence GM-CSF receptor expression, suggesting that receptor upregulation by TNF is not mediated through activation of protein kinase C. On the other hand, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide abrogates receptor upregulation induced by TNF. In contrast to these findings in AML, TNF does not upregulate GM-CSF receptor numbers on blood granulocytes or monocytes. We conclude that TNF exerts positive effects on growth factor receptor expression of hematopoietic cells.",480,1
"Transfection and stable transformation of adult mouse Schwann cells with SV-40 large T antigen gene. Cultured Schwann cells derived from adult mouse dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves were transfected with a plasmid containing SV-40 large T antigen gene, and 25 colonies of stable transformants were obtained, one of which was expanded and recloned. This transfected cell line, designated MS1, expressed SV-40 large T antigen and showed continuous cell growth with a doubling time of 27 hours. The MS1 cells had distinct Schwann cell phenotypes such as S-100 protein, laminin, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase and P0 protein, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. When MS1 cells were exposed to dibutyryl cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (dbc AMP), they extended long bipolar processes two- to ten-fold longer than those of untreated MS1 cells and frequently formed whorl-like alignments similar to palisade formations or organoid patterns observed in human Schwannomas and neurofibromas. These results suggest that transformed Schwann cells can be a useful model for analyzing regulatory mechanisms of Schwann cells, neuron-Schwann cell interactions and experimental Schwann cell neoplasms in vitro.",261,0
"Subclinical vulvar papillomavirus infection. Eighty-eight cases of subclinical human papillomavirus (HPV) vulvar infection were detected in a consecutive colposcopic series of 968 women. Three patterns of acetowhite lesions had a 72% predictive value (88/122) for histologically assessed HPV. The prevalence of subclinical vulvar HPV in self-referred patients was 7.9% (73/918); it was 9% (88/968) in the overall series and significantly higher in younger patients (age less than 25 years: 21/106, or 19.8%) or in those with cervical HPV or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (40/100, or 40%). Routine inspection of the vulva after acetic acid lavage in association with a Papanicolaou test might help identify Papanicolaou-test-negative patients at high risk of developing cervical HPV or CIN. Treatment with beta-interferon (2,000,000 IU daily intramuscularly for 10 days) was given to 30 consecutive patients, but the results were poor: regression was observed in only 2 cases.",266,1
"Immunohistochemical study of vascular lesions in severe hypertension induced by DOCA and salt administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In order to evaluate whether immunoglobulin deposition in vessels plays some role in the development of vascular lesions in severe hypertension, an immunohistochemical study was performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), to which deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and salt were administered. DOCA and salt rapidly induced severe hypertensive vascular lesions, including necrotizing arteriolitis and productive endarteritis. In these rats, considerable deposits of IgG and IgM were found in the small arteries and arterioles of the kidneys. These deposits were accompanied by complement (C3), and could be eluted by acid incubation. They were localized in periodic acid-Schiff-positive insudative lesions, which were thought to be an early phase of the hypertensive vascular lesions. These results suggest that the immunoglobulins might be bound to an unknown antigen in the vascular lesions and that some immunological mechanism mediated by the immunoglobulins is involved in the development of vascular lesions in severe hypertension.",215,0
"Elderly men with histories of heavy drinking: correlates and consequences. Recognition that the physical, psychological and social consequences of substance abuse may persist throughout the life span has led to increased study of the impact of lifetime drinking habits on the elderly. We examined the characteristics of elderly men with self-reported histories of having ever been heavy drinker (H+) in a population-based (N = 1,155, mean age = 73.7 years) longitudinal survey of community-dwelling elders; 10.4% of the men reported that they had been heavy drinkers at some time during their lives. H+ men were younger and less educated than non-heavy drinkers (H-) or never drinkers (N). Mortality was higher among H+ men who were current drinkers than among H- or N men. H+ men reported more major illnesses, poorer self-perceived health status, more physician visits, more depressive symptoms, lower levels of life satisfaction and smaller social networks than did H- or N men. Self-reported ability to perform activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living was poorest among H+ men, who also scored the lowest on a mental status examination. Thus, a history of having ever been a heavy drinker is predictive of widespread impairments in physical, psychological and social health and functioning among elderly men.",270,1
"Endoscopic palliative intubation of the esophagus invaded by lung cancer. Thirty-two patients with esophageal involvement by lung cancer were managed by endoscopic intubation. In 22 patients with extrinsic esophageal strictures, the success rate of intubation was 91%, and 82% were discharged with their dysphagia relieved and esophageal patency restored. The mean survival rate was 4.4 months. In 10 patients with esophago-bronchial fistulas, 3 had the fistulous tract obliterated and lived a mean of 5 months. This low success rate of closing fistulas is due to failure to seal off the space between the stent and the fistula because of absence of tumor-associated stenosis. The overall morbidity rate was 28.1% (18.8% perforation, 6.3% hemorrhage, and 3.1% tracheal obstruction). The overall mortality rate was 18.8%. Although complications were more frequent than in primary esophageal tumors, endoscopic intubation was the only way to palliate this desperate condition and provided 66.6% of patients with relief of symptoms, nutritional improvement, and a mean survival time of 4.5 months.",248,1
"Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome terminating as disseminated T-cell lymphoma. The authors describe a case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) terminated as a T-cell lymphoma in a 3-year-old girl. The clinical course was chronic and characterized by chronic eczema, persistent peripheral blood eosinophilia, organomegaly, interstitial lung change, and pericarditis. Postmortem examination demonstrated a disseminated T-cell lymphoma involving the inguinal lymph node, liver, lung, and kidney. The findings of the current case suggest a possibility that certain abnormalities in this case of idiopathic HES per se may have triggered the development of malignant lymphoma, and it may represent a transition of idiopathic HES into a T-cell lymphoma. Other possible sequences are discussed. The development of T-cell malignancy in idiopathic HES in a girl is quite an unusual presentation.",177,1
"Lower leg subcutaneous blood flow during walking and passive dependency in chronic venous insufficiency. The blood flow in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the lower leg of eight normal subjects and 19 patients with chronic venous insufficiency was measured. The 133Xe-washout technique was used with portable CdT1(C1) detectors and a data storage unit. Only those patients with ulcers and a systolic blood pressure at the toe of greater than or equal to 60 mm were investigated. In the controls the relative blood flow during sitting was 0.61 (range 0.35-0.80). In the patients it was 0.46 (range 0.22-0.87). This difference was not significant. During walking the blood flow increased in controls as well as in the patients compared to the value determined in the sitting position (P = 0.0078 and P = 0.0028, respectively, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). The relative blood-flow rate during walking was 0.96 (range 0.60-1.58) in the controls, and 1.04 (range 0.49-1.46) in the patients. The difference between the normal subjects and the patients was not significant (P = 0.79). We conclude from our studies that patients with venous insufficiency are able to increase their blood flow during walking to the same extent as normal controls.",310,0
"The isolation and characterization of a Norwalk virus-specific cDNA. Norwalk virus, an important cause of epidemic, acute, nonbacterial gastroenteritis in adults and children, has eluded adaptation to tissue culture, the development of an animal model, and molecular cloning. In this study, a portion of the Norwalk viral genome encoding an immunoreactive region was cloned from very small quantities of infected stool using sequence-independent single primer amplification. Six overlapping complementary DNA (cDNA) clones were isolated by immunologic screening. The expressed recombinant protein from a representative clone reacted with six of seven high titer. Norwalk-specific, postinfection sera but not with corresponding preinfection sera. Nucleic acid sequence for all clones defined a single open reading frame contiguous with the lambda gt11-expressed beta-galactosidase protein. Only oligonucleotide probes specific for the positive strand (defined by the open reading frame) hybridized to an RNaseA-sensitive, DNaseI-resistant nucleic acid sequence extracted from Norwalk-infected stool. Furthermore, RNA extracted from serial postinfection, but not preinfection, stools from three of five volunteers hybridized to a Norwalk virus cDNA probe. Clone-specific oligonucleotide probes hybridized with cesium chloride gradient fractions containing purified Norwalk virion. In conclusion, an antigenic, protein-coding region of the Norwalk virus genome has been identified. This epitope has potential utility in future sero- and molecular epidemiologic studies of Norwalk viral gastroenteritis.",292,0
"Microinvasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IA). In 1985 the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) subdivided Stage IA cervical cancer and specified metric criteria to demarcate Stage IA from Stage IB. Early stromal invasion (Stage IA1) denotes the first invasive protrusions of a carcinoma in situ into the stroma. Microcarcinomas (Stage IA2) are small cancers a number of orders of magnitude larger than Stage IA1 lesions and with a maximum depth of invasion of 5 mm and a maximum horizontal spread of 7 mm; larger lesions are classified as Stage IB. This study reviews 486 patients previously classified as having Stage IA disease. This yielded 344 Stage IA1 and 101 Stage IA2 lesions; 41 cancers were reclassified as Stage IB. Three hundred nine, 89, and 38 patients were followed for greater than or equal to 5 years. One (0.3%) patient with Stage IA1 disease re-presented with Stage IIB disease 12 years after conization. Five (5.6%) patients with Stage IA2 lesions developed invasive recurrences; three died. None of the 38 patients reclassified as having a Stage IB lesion, including 16 who were treated conservatively, developed a recurrence. The FIGO classification is not a guideline for treatment. Stage IA1 lesions can be treated conservatively, but treatment in Stage IA2 must be individualized. Risk factors such as vascular space involvement and confluency are of high sensitivity but low specificity.",332,1
"Increased uptake of bromodeoxyuridine by hepatocytes from early stage of primary biliary cirrhosis. The relationship between DNA synthesis activities of hepatocytes in biopsied specimens and liver volume was studied in various stages of primary biliary cirrhosis using an in vitro bromodeoxyuridine (a thymidine analogue)-anti-bromodeoxyuridine reaction and computed tomography. The mean bromodeoxyuridine (+/- SE) labeling index for 10 patients in an early histological stage (stage I, 4, and stage II, 6, 3.4% +/- 0.4%) of primary biliary cirrhosis was 17 times that for 6 control subjects (0.2% +/- 0.1%, P less than 0.001), and was significantly higher than that for 19 female patients with chronic aggressive hepatitis (0.9% +/- 0.2%, P less than 0.001), 14 compensated cirrhotic patients of viral origin (all female, 1.1% +/- 0.3%, P less than 0.01), and 5 patients with stage III primary biliary cirrhosis (0.5% +/- 0.1%, P less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SE) liver volume in the early stage of primary biliary cirrhosis (1225 +/- 40 cm3) was about 1.5 times that in control subjects (835 +/- 42 cm3, P less than 0.001). These results suggest that liver volume has already become large in the early stage of primary biliary cirrhosis perhaps because of markedly increased DNA synthesis in hepatocytes.",349,0
"Oxygen-exacerbated bleomycin pulmonary toxicity Bleomycin is an antineoplastic agent with potential for producing pulmonary toxicity, attributed in part to its free radical-promoting ability. Clinical and research experiences have suggested that the risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury is increased with the administration of oxygen. We report a case in which the intraoperative administration of oxygen in the setting of previous bleomycin therapy contributed to postoperative ventilatory failure. Our patient recovered with corticosteroid therapy. Physician awareness of a potential interaction between oxygen and bleomycin may help reduce the morbidity and mortality related to bleomycin therapy. ",122,1
"Total gastrectomy for gastric cancer in the elderly. Of 1070 patients with gastric cancers, 292 patients underwent total gastrectomy during 13 years. Sixty patients were more than 70 years of age and 232 were under 69 years. The incidence of well-differentiated carcinomas and poorly differentiated carcinomas was the same in the elderly patients, whereas the latter was dominant in the young patients. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding location, size, macroscopic patterns, extent of lymph metastases, or stage classification. The rates of preoperative surgical risk factors were significantly different between the two groups (p less than 0.01): 90.0% for the elderly and 34.9% for the young patients. However, the rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality were 31.7% and 3.3% for the elderly and 24.1% and 1.3% for the young patients, respectively, with no significant difference. The 5- and 10-year survival rates after curative total gastrectomy were 48.6% and 23.2% for the elderly compared with 49.4% and 33.6% for the young patients, respectively, with no significant difference. A 5-year survival rate after noncurative operation was 0% for the elderly and 6.4% for the young patients. These results indicate that, when performed for cure, total gastrectomy with systematic lymphadenectomy can provide good long-term results for elderly, as well as young, patients.",345,1
"Lexical organization of nouns and verbs in the brain. The analysis of neuropsychological disorders of lexical processing has provided important clues about the general organization of the lexical system and the internal structure of the processing components. Reports of patients with selective dysfunction of specific semantic categories such as abstract versus concrete words, living things versus inanimate objects, animals, fruits and vegetables, proper names and so forth, support the hypothesis that the neural organization of the semantic processing component is organized in these categories. There are reports of selective dysfunction of the grammatical categories noun and verb, suggesting that a dimension of lexical organization is the grammatical class of words. But the results reported in these studies have not provided unambiguous evidence concerning two fundamental questions about the nature and the locus of this organization within the lexical system. Is the noun-verb distinction represented in the semantic or in the phonological and orthographic lexicons? Is grammatical-class knowledge represented independently of lexical forms or is it represented separately and redundantly within each modality-specific lexicon? Here we report the performance of two brain-damaged subjects with modality-specific deficits restricted principally (H.W.) or virtually only (S.J.D) to verbs in oral and written production, respectively. The contrasting performance suggests that grammatical-class distinctions are redundantly represented in the phonological and orthographic output lexical components. ",267,0

"Phase I study of interleukin-2 and interferon alfa-2a as outpatient therapy for patients with advanced malignancy. Twenty-six patients were treated in this phase I study with the combination of interleukin-2 (IL2) administered as a continuous infusion and interferon alfa-2a (IFN alpha-2a) administered intramuscularly to patients in an outpatient setting. The maximum-tolerated dose of both agents given as outpatient therapy was 2 x 10(6) U/m2 days 1 to 5 of IL2 and 9 x 10(6) U/m2 days 1, 3, and 5 of IFN alpha-2a for 4 consecutive weeks. A 2- to 4-week rest period was permitted after each 4 weeks of treatment. Fatigue was the treatment-limiting toxicity, and serious clinical or laboratory abnormalities occurred infrequently during this study. Patients with colon cancer metastatic to the liver tolerated treatment worse than patients with other tumors. Twelve of the 15 patients with renal cell cancer were assessable for response determinations. Of these 12 patients, three exhibited complete tumor regression, three have had partial objective regression, and three patients experienced stabilization of rapidly progressive disease. This therapy appears to be well tolerated in an outpatient treatment setting and shows significant activity against advanced renal cell cancer.",273,1
"Role of angioplasty in myocardial infarction management strategies: a review. The role of angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction has been extensively studied in the past few years. Although angioplasty in some circumstances can be the primary reperfusion intervention, logistic problems and the excellent results of intravenous thrombolytic therapy have resulted in postlytic angioplasty being the preferred use of this interventional strategy. Clinical trials of this strategy have not supported its routine use, however, and a much more selective application of postthrombolytic coronary artery dilation is advocated at this time. ",114,0

"Esophageal contribution to chest pain in patients with coronary artery disease. We conducted a prospective study to determine the role of the esophagus in causing chest pain in patients with established CAD on optimum therapy. Thirty-two men with documented CAD who complained of frequent and usually daily retrosternal chest pain were evaluated. Following a standard esophageal manometry and acid perfusion test, simultaneous two-channel ambulatory Holter monitor and esophageal pH record tests were performed for 24 hours. Fifty-three episodes of chest pain were documented in 20 patients; 11 patients were free of pain. Of the 20 patients who complained of chest pains, 17 (85 percent) demonstrated at least one episode of PPR, defined as a drop in distal esophageal pH to less than 4 within ten minutes before or after the onset chest pain. Episodes of asymptomatic GER were common. The correlation of PPR with chest pain was 70 percent (37/53 episodes) and of ischemic ECG changes with chest pain 13 percent (7/53); in the remaining, there was no correlation with either. Two patients demonstrated simultaneous PPR and ischemic ECG changes. Seventeen esophageal motility abnormalities were observed in 14 patients (45 percent). It is our conclusion that esophageal disorders contribute to chest pain in patients with documented CAD. In this group, GER plays a greater role than in those with normal coronary arteries. In addition, esophageal motility disorders are common in these patients. Esophageal testing can be undertaken safely in these patients.",308,0
"Possible mechanisms of abnormal norepinephrine sensitivity and reactivity of resistance vessels and the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. A hypothesis. This study examined structural and functional changes of mesenteric resistance vessels in early, developing, and established stages of hypertension development in spontaneously hypertensive rats in an attempt to identify possible mechanisms of the development and maintenance of hypertension. Our results suggest that the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats may be caused by genetic structural and functional abnormalities of resistance vessels. Both abnormalities may be caused by hyperreactivity to norepinephrine through an altered signal transduction process, including the regulation of protein kinase C in smooth muscle cells of resistance vessels in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

"Intraluminal pressure adjacent to left colonic anastomoses. A cumulative total of 89 h of pressure data was acquired from both sides of a left colonic anastomosis in 15 patients over a median period of 7 postoperative study days. Patients had a colonic ileus lasting 3-10 days and during this proximal and distal inactivity the intraluminal pressure remained within 6 mmHg of atmospheric pressure. After recovery of activity, pressures proximal to the anastomosis in excess of 10 mmHg occurred during less than 1 per cent of the recording time. Distal peak pressures were significantly elevated with respect to the proximal site (P less than 0.001). Two-thirds of the distal pressures recorded were between 10 and 20 mmHg and 98 per cent were less than 50 mmHg; the peak distal pressure was 90 mmHg. Four patients had distal repetitive tonic contractions creating a pressure difference across the anastomosis with a mean of 20 mmHg and a peak of 45 mmHg. Each contraction persisted for 15-20 min. Intraluminal pressures are unlikely to play a role in anastomotic dehiscence.",250,1
"Evidence for platelet-activating factor as a late-phase mediator of chronic pancreatitis in the rat. The role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a mediator of pancreatic inflammation was examined in the rat pancreatic duct ligation model of obstructive pancreatitis. Pancreatic generation of PAF, as measured by bioassay (ie, platelet [3H]serotonin secretion), was determined at various times after induction of inflammation. Tissue levels of PAF in the normal pancreas averaged 600 +/- 49 pg/g, but PAF was not detectable during the initial 24 hours of pancreatitis, a time when the inflammatory reaction would be considered acute, that is, during the period of maximal serum amylase release and the development of interstitial edema. However a substantial increase in pancreatic PAF levels (12 times control levels) was observed 7 to 14 days after duct ligation during the late-phase response interval similar to the situation characteristic of chronic pancreatitis in which parenchymal atrophy, fibrosis, and pancreatic insufficiency evolve. One week after duct ligation when PAF levels peaked, an evaluation was made of the effects of PAF antagonists (BN52021 and WEB2170) on pancreatic lesions using Evan's blue extravasation, pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and acid phosphatase activity in peritoneal lavage fluid. BN52021 or WEB2170 treatment was shown to reduce pancreatic damage and inflammation significantly. Long-term in vivo administration of exogenous PAF (20 micrograms/kg/hr for 7 days) exhibited a reduction of [3H]thymidine uptake into and amylase release from pancreatic acini in vitro. Our observations 1) that pancreatic PAF levels increased significantly during the chronic phase of obstructive pancreatitis induced by duct ligation; 2) that inhibition of the action of PAF, through specific receptor antagonism, caused an attenuation of pancreatic lesions; and 3) that chronic administration of PAF resulted in decreased pancreatic regeneration and exocrine function are consistent with a pivotal role for PAF as a late-phase inflammatory mediator in chronic pancreatitis in rats.",434,0
"Long survival and prognostic factors in hepatocellular carcinoma. We studied survival and prognostic factors in all cases of hepatocellular carcinoma seen at a Midwestern teaching hospital from 1947 through 1986. Of the 70 cases, 56 were diagnosed during life and 14 at autopsy. There were 47 males and 23 females with age at diagnosis ranging from 14 to 88. Median survival for the 56 patients diagnosed during life was 106 days. Only 11 patients lived longer than one year. Two patients were long survivors and presumed cured, one living 27 years after diagnosis and surgical treatment and the other 19 years. Cox regression model showed young age at diagnosis and low stage of disease at diagnosis to be significant predictors of long survival. White patients survived nearly twice as long as black patients but the difference was not significant. Gender and year of diagnosis did not appear to be important determinants of survival. Pathologic material was still available for one of the two long survivors and the histology was that of fibrolamellar carcinoma of young adults.",230,1
Locally recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the prostate after radical prostatectomy. Endometrioid carcinoma of the prostate is considered a variant of classical prostatic ductal carcinoma. Endometrioid carcinoma variant often has the unique clinical presentation of gross hematuria.

"Treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy by enlargement of the spinal canal anteriorly, followed by arthrodesis. Thirty-seven patients who had enlargement of the spinal canal anteriorly and stabilization of the spine for cervical spondylotic myelopathy were followed for an average of forty-nine months (range, twenty-eight to seventy months). Myelography and computed tomographic myelography were performed preoperatively on all patients to determine the location and features of the areas of decompression. The canal was enlarged by discectomy; by subtotal corpectomy and removal of the anteromedial parts of the pedicles; or by removal of osteophytes or of the posterior longitudinal ligament, or both. Partial corpectomy and interbody arthrodesis was performed in nine patients; subtotal corpectomy, including removal of the posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in fifteen patients; and subtotal corpectomy, with detachment of the remaining thin posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in thirteen patients. Postoperatively, radiographic examinations, including myelography and computed tomographic myelography, were performed for thirty-six patients and magnetic resonance imaging, for twenty-eight. A satisfactory neurological result was obtained in twenty-nine patients. Atrophy of the spinal cord, as seen on preoperative computed-tomographic myelograms, was predictive of an unsatisfactory result of the decompression, as was weakness of the peroneal muscles. All but one of the thirty-seven patients had improved walking ability at the most recent follow-up examination: seventeen patients improved by 1 point; fourteen, by 2 points; four, by 3 points; and one, by 4 points. The remaining patient reverted to the preoperative status after an initial improvement. The ability to walk at the interim examinations was compared with that at the most recent examination; three patients had continuing improvement, while three others had deterioration. The main cause of deterioration was new spondylotic changes associated with stenosis of the spinal canal, occurring at the level of the disc just cephalad to the fused levels. We concluded that anterior decompression followed by a secure arthrodesis should be an extensive procedure for patients who have cervical spondylotic myelopathy, as determined preoperatively from a myelogram or computed tomographic myelogram. Excision of the vertebral bodies should also be wide and should include the anteromedial parts of the pedicles. The third or fourth cervical vertebra should be included in the arthrodesis prophylactically in patients who have stenosis of the spinal canal when either of these vertebrae is adjacent to the level of fusion.",548,0
"Operation Everest II: ventilatory adaptation during gradual decompression to extreme altitude. To assess the ventilatory adaptation during gradual ascent to extreme altitude, we studied seven healthy males as part of the 40 d simulated ascent of Mt. Everest in a hypobaric chamber. We measured resting ventilation (VE, l.min-1), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2%), the ventilatory response to oxygen breathing, isocapnic hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), and hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) at sea level prior to the ascent (760 torr), 14,000 feet (428 torr), 24,000 feet (305 torr), and within 24 h of descent (765 torr). VE increased from 9.3 +/- 1.1 l.min-1 at 760 torr to 23.4 +/- 1.3 l.min-1 at 305 torr and remained elevated at 14.7 +/- 0.7 l.min-1 after descent. Oxygen breathing decreased VE by 9.6 +/- 1.3 l.min-1 at 305 torr. Isocapnic HVR (expressed as a positive slope of VE/SaO2, l.min-1.%SaO2(-1) increased from 0.18 +/- 0.07 at 760 torr to 0.34 +/- 0.11 and 0.38 +/- 0.5 at 428 torr and 305 torr (P less than 0.05) respectively. HVR was elevated further upon return to sea level (0.8 +/- 0.09, P less than 0.05). HCVR (S = VE/PETCO2, l.min-1.torr-1) increased from sea level (S = 4.4 +/- 0.09) to 305 torr (S = 18.7 +/- 3.5, P less than 0.01) and remained elevated upon return to sea level (S = 10.7 +/- 4.6, P less than 0.001). This study is the first to investigate the ventilatory response to such extreme altitude and so soon after descent and shows that hypoxic and hypercapnic responses increase during prolonged progressive hypoxic exposure and remain significantly elevated from pre-ascent levels immediately upon descent.",538,0
"Peroxisomal disorders. Although peroxisomes were once considered a vestige, their importance in cellular metabolism is clearly established by the many inherited diseases that have been described in the past two decades. Unfortunately there is no definitive treatment for the various disorders, but based on the recognition of the biochemical abnormalities, prenatal testing and appropriate genetic counseling can be provided. It is essential for clinicians to be aware of this group of diseases, as diagnosis and further study of these patients are essential in understanding the basic etiologic mechanisms underlying these complex groups of disorders. Clearly, there is much to be learned about the relationship between biochemical abnormalities and the phenotypic variability of the peroxisomal disorders. ",136,0
"Natural history and prognostic factors for chronic hepatitis type B. One hundred and five hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients presenting with chronic persistent hepatitis (n = 46) or chronic active hepatitis without cirrhosis (n = 59) were followed longitudinally for one to 16 years (mean 5.5 years) and underwent follow up biopsy. During a mean histological follow up of 3.7 years, active cirrhosis developed in 21 (20%) patients one to 13 years after entry to the study with a calculated annual incidence of 5.9%. The probability of evolution to cirrhosis was significantly higher in patients with chronic active hepatitis and bridging hepatic necrosis than in those with moderate chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis (p less than 0.0001). Cox multiple regression analysis showed that the following three variables independently implied poor prognosis: older age, presence of bridging hepatic necrosis, and persistence of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum (p less than 0.0001). These findings indicate that patients with severe chronic active hepatitis and persistent hepatitis B virus replication are at very high risk of rapid progression to cirrhosis.",238,0
"Vulvar Paget's disease. Is immunocytochemistry helpful in assessing the surgical margins? From January 1977 to December 1988, 19 patients with biopsy-proven Paget's disease of the vulva underwent simple or radical vulvectomy at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center. All vulvectomy specimens were evaluated immunocytochemically for the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and low-molecular-weight keratins 8 and 18 (LMK), both in areas containing neoplastic cells and in histologically negative surgical margins. Neoplastic Paget's cells stained positively for CEA in all cases; they were positive for EMA and LMK in 18 and 17 cases, respectively. In all eight cases with underlying in situ or invasive carcinomas, CEA, EMA and LMK were localized in the underlying tumors as well. None of the histologically proven negative margins reacted for CEA, EMA or LMK on immunocytochemistry. CEA appears to be a valuable immunocytochemical marker for extramammary Paget's disease; EMA and LMK are also expressed by the majority of such cases. None of these markers, however, is of added value in identifying Paget's cells in surgical margins if those margins appear negative on routine hematoxylin-and-eosin staining.",289,1
"Oculo-bulbar myasthenic symptoms as the sole sign of tumour involving or compressing the brain stem. Four patients with tumours involving or compressing the brain stem are described whose initial clinical symptoms of fluctuating paresis of the external ocular muscles and/or the pharyngeal muscles without other neurological deficits led to the primary diagnosis of focal myasthenia. The combination of an unusual clinical pattern, involvement of muscles of only one ocular nerve or severe dysphagia/dysarthria without extension of the myasthenic symptoms, should lead to further investigation to exclude other reasons of a focal myasthenic syndrome such as a brain-stem tumour.

"Prediction of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis: a prospective follow-up study. Endoscopic, clinical, and laboratory parameters including presence of varices in the gastric fundus, red color sign, diameter and number of variceal columns, platelet count, and the Child status were assessed in 109 patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices without previous variceal bleeding. During a mean follow-up period of 21 months, the predictive values of these parameters with regard to first bleeding incidence and mortality rate were studied. The incidence of bleeding was 29%, and the mortality rate 46%. Endoscopic criteria (presence of varices in the gastric fundus, presence of the red color sign, and size of the largest varix) as well as alcoholic etiology of cirrhosis showed a significant positive correlation with the bleeding incidence but not with mortality. Contrary to this, two factors of the Child classification (encephalopathy and ascites) and age positively correlated with mortality but not with the bleeding incidence.",203,0
"Value and limitations of proximal jet dimensions for the quantitation of valvular regurgitation: an in vitro study using Doppler flow imaging. To evaluate usefulness and limitations of proximal jet dimensions for the quantitation of valvular regurgitation, fluid jets were created in a pulsatile flow model, and proximal jet width and cross-sectional area were measured by means of color Doppler flow imaging. When circular orifices with diameters from 1 to 6 mm were studied, jet width and cross-sectional jet area measured as close as possible to the orifice were directly related to the orifice diameter (r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate, 0.4 mm; y = 0.5 + 0.97x) and the orifice area (r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate, 5.7 mm2; y = 0.22 + 2.47x), respectively. No significant dependence on flow rate or pressure gradient was found for these measurements. Jet width was measured with color M-mode Doppler by use of the smallest sample volume size (1 mm) and was slightly greater than the orifice diameter (4.2 +/- 1.7 mm versus 3.8 +/- 1.7 mm). However, cross-sectional areas were approximately fourfold the orifice areas, on average (52.5 +/- 24.6 mm2 versus 12.3 +/- 9.7 mm2), with a range of twelvefold (smallest orifice) to threefold (largest orifice). When the sample volume size was reduced from 2.4 to 1.0 mm, color areas decreased by 25.6 +/- 6.0%. Slit-shaped orifices were studied with two different orientations of the slit-parallel and perpendicular to the ultrasound beam: Color M-mode measurements were again slightly greater than length and width of the slit, but cross-sectional areas were substantially larger than the orifice areas and increased between 44% and 115% when changing the orientation of the slit from perpendicular to parallel. This, again, reflected problems with lateral resolution. When cross-sectional areas were measured at increasing distances from the orifice, the cross-sectional jet area increased significantly within a few millimeters. This increase was greater with higher gradients and smaller orifice sizes. In case of a small orifice (2 mm) and a high gradient (130 to 160 mm Hg), increase in area was as great as 122% within a distance of only 5 mm. Thus, proximal jet width and cross-sectional area were directly related to the orifice size, which could be a valuable parameter for the evaluation of valvular regurgitation. Measurements of jet width by color M-mode seemed to be most accurate but are limited by the fact that in vivo valvular defects may be irregular rather than of circular shape.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",610,0
"Squamous cell carcinoma in situ arising in an ovarian mature cystic teratoma. Report of one case with histopathologic, cytogenetic, and flow cytometric DNA content analysis. A squamous cell carcinoma in situ arose in an ovarian mature teratoma (ie, dermoid cyst) in a 62-year-old woman. Flow cytometric DNA content analysis of paraffin-embedded in situ carcinoma showed a normal DNA content with moderate to high proliferative activity (S-phase fraction estimate, 16% to 18%). Cytogenetic analysis of the in situ cancer and the benign cystic portion of the tumor revealed a 46,XX karyotype. In addition, the benign cystic portion of the tumor revealed homozygous chromosomal heteromorphisms, compared with heterozygous markers found in peripheral blood lymphocytes. These results show that this squamous cell carcinoma in situ was euploid and suggest that the mature cystic teratoma was derived from a single germ cell after meiosis I.",193,1
"Terminal cancer care and patients' preference for place of death: a prospective study. OBJECTIVE--To assess the preference of terminally ill patients with cancer for their place of final care. DESIGN--Prospective study of randomly selected patients with cancer from hospital and the community who were expected to die within a year. Patients expected to live less than two months were interviewed at two week intervals; otherwise patients were interviewed monthly. Their main carer was interviewed three months after the patient's death. SETTING--District general hospital, hospices, and patients' homes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Stated preferred place of final care; actual place of death; reason for final hospital admission for those in hospital; community care provision required for home care. RESULTS--Of 98 patients approached, 84 (86%) agreed to be interviewed, of whom 70 (83%) died during the study and 59 (84%) stated a preferred place of final care: 34 (58%) wished to die at home given existing circumstances, 12 (20%) in hospital, 12 (20%) in a hospice, and one (2%) elsewhere. Their own home was the preferred place of care for 17 (94%) of the patients who died there, whereas of the 32 patients who died in hospital 22 (69%) had stated a preference to die elsewhere. Had circumstances been more favourable 67% (41) of patients would have preferred to die at home, 16% (10) in hospital, and 15% (9) in hospice. CONCLUSION--With a limited increase in community care 50% more patients with cancer could be supported to die at home, as they and their carers would prefer.",369,1
"Molecular analysis of acute promyelocytic leukemia breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 17. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; FAB M3) is characterized by a predominance of malignant promyelocytes that carry a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17) (q22;q11.2-q12). This translocation has become diagnostic for APL, as it is present in almost 100 percent of cases. A Not I linking clone was used to detect this translocation initially on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and subsequently with conventional Southern (DNA) analysis. The breakpoints in ten APL cases examined were shown to cluster in a 12-kb region of chromosome 17, containing two CpG-rich islands. The region is the first intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RARA).",189,1
"Massive allografts in salvage revisions of failed total knee arthroplasties. Ten patients with failed total knee arthroplasties and severe bone loss were treated with massive whole distal femur and proximal tibial allografts in combination with prosthetic implants. Fourteen allografts were inserted either as invaginated or segmental grafts and were rigidly fixed to the host bone. Clinically and roentgenographically, 12 of 14 grafts (86%) seemed to have united to the host bone. The average range of motion was 92 degrees. Five patients developed complications; two of these involved the allograft (nonunion and fracture) and two were caused by inadequate healing at the ligament-allograft junction. One patient had a late infection. With careful planning and improved surgical techniques, these complications can be avoided. The massive allograft-prosthesis composite techniques is a viable reconstructive alternative worthy of further clinical trials.",189,0

"Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in two children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Postmortem examination disclosed central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in two children who died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) at 6 and 14 months of age, respectively. Systemic signs of lymphoma were not present. The B-cell origin and clonality of the neoplastic cells were established by immunohistochemistry in one case and by molecular analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in the other. Moreover, in the latter case the neoplastic cells were characterized by the presence of a single episomal EBV genome. According to these data, the monoclonal B-cell proliferation occurred after EBV infection, thus suggesting a possible pathogenetic role of EBV in the early stages of lymphomagenesis.",158,1
"Cholesterol screening in a black inner-city pediatric population. A screening for total blood cholesterol levels was conducted by the University of Louisville Department of Family Practice in association with the National Youth Sports Program in Louisville, Kentucky. On May 30, 1987, 224 inner-city children between 10 and 16 years of age were tested; 109 (49%) were girls and 115 (51%) were boys. All participants were black. Of the entire population, the girls had a slightly lower mean level of cholesterol than the boys (160 mg/dL vs 165 mg/dL, respectively). Because of the large number of participants aged 10 to 14 years (211), this subset of children was studied more closely. In this age group, 47 (22%) of the children were at moderate risk for future cardiovascular disease and 48 (23%) were at high risk. The serum cholesterol levels were relatively constant in all children until age 12, after which a slight reduction occurred. This decrease is more evident in boys. Our study also showed a correlation between increased blood cholesterol and above normal weight/height indices (ie, Quetelet scores), with nearly 70% of all children having elevated cholesterol levels also exhibiting above normal Quetelet scores. We observed no correlation between high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure in this study population. Dietary intervention is recommended as the initial treatment for elevated cholesterol levels in children.",317,0
"Prolongation of ventricular refractoriness by class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs in the prevention of ventricular tachycardia induction. The effects of class la antiarrhythmic drugs (procainamide, quinidine) on the right ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) and intraventricular conduction time were assessed during serial invasive electrophysiologic studies for sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). In 47 patients with remote myocardial infarction, sustained VT was inducible by up to two extrastimuli after the basic drive at one of two basic cycle lengths at the right ventricular apex. With oral drug administration, sustained VT was no longer inducible (group I) in 27 patients but remained inducible (group II) in 20 with the same protocol. Class la drugs prolonged the VERP in both groups, but there was greater lengthening when drugs were effective (e.g., +32 +/- 14 msec in group I vs +12 +/- 19 msec in group II; p less than 0.005, basic cycle length 600 to 700 msec). Prolongation of the VERP by greater than 30 msec had an 88% positive predictive value for prevention of sustained VT induction. In all except one patient in group I, drugs prolonged the VERP such that the coupling intervals that had resulted in sustained VT induction under control conditions were no longer attainable. In contrast, conduction time through the ventricle (surface QRS duration) in sinus rhythm and during right ventricular pacing was prolonged similarly regardless of efficacy (e.g., +33 +/- 21 msec vs +27 +/- 27 msec at a cycle length of 400 msec). The presence of similar plasma levels of drug did not imply equivalent prolongation of the VERP in the two groups. These results suggest that greater prolongation of the VERP by oral procainamide or quinidine correlates with drug efficacy against VT induction and is a better predictor of drug effect than achievement of a ""therapeutic plasma level."".",416,0
"Regional and systemic distribution of anti-tumor x anti-CD3 heteroaggregate antibodies and cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes in a human colon cancer xenograft. Anti-tumor antibody (317G5) covalently coupled to an anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) produces a heteroaggregate (HA) antibody that can target PBL to lyse tumor cells expressing the appropriate tumor Ag. The i.v. and i.p. distribution of radiolabeled HA antibody 317G5 x OKT3 and of radiolabeled cultured human PBL were studied in athymic nude mice bearing solid intraperitoneal tumor established from the human colon tumor line, LS174T. Mice were injected with 125I-labeled HA antibody, 125I-labeled anti-tumor mAb, or 111In-labeled PBL, and at designated timepoints tissues were harvested and measured for radioactivity. 125I-317G5 x OKT3 localized specifically to tumor sites. Tumor radioactivity levels (percent injected dose/gram) were lower with 125I-317G5 x OKT3 HA antibody than with 125I-317G5 anti-tumor mAb, but were similar to levels reported for other anti-tumor mAb. The major difference in radioactivity levels observed between i.v. and i.p. administration of 125I-317G5 x OKT3 was an increase in hepatic radioactivity after i.v. HA antibody administration. HA antibodies produced from F(ab')2 fragments, which exhibit decreased m. w. and decreased Fc receptor-mediated binding, demonstrated improved tumor:tissue ratios as compared to intact antibody HA. 125I-317G5 F(ab')2 x OKT3 F(ab')2 antibody levels were equivalent to intact HA antibody levels in tumor, but were lower than intact HA antibody levels in the blood, bowel, and liver. Tumor:bowel ratios (20:1 at 48 h) were highest when 317G5 F(ab')2 x OKT3 F(ab')2 was injected i.p. Autoradiography confirmed that anti-tumor x anti-CD3 HA antibodies localized specifically to intraperitoneal tumor; that i.p. administered HA antibodies penetrated tumor directly; and that i.v. administered HA antibodies distributed along tumor vasculature. Cultured human PBL distributed in moderate concentrations to intraperitoneal tumor when administered i.p., but not when administered i.v. The poor localization of i.v. injected PBL to tumor may reflect species disparity in homing receptors and/or endothelial ligands, a problem which may be overcome with a syngeneic model. These results suggest that regional therapy with HA antibodies and PBL may offer advantages over systemic therapy for initial clinical trials.",604,1

"Multiple intracranial mucoceles associated with phaeohyphomycosis of the paranasal sinuses. The purpose of this article is to alert clinicians to a new pathogenic fungus of the paranasal sinuses called Exserohilum rostratum. Exserohilum species are one of the etiologic agents of phaeohyphomycosis, a constellation of entities caused by dematiaceous fungi. This class of fungal sinus infection has emerged only in the past decade; it occurs primarily in immunocompetent individuals and produces a tenacious, progressive pansinusitis. To our knowledge, this study describes the first case of multiple intracranial mucoceles secondary to E rostratum. The diagnostic workup includes computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by direct microscopic examination of tissue biopsy specimens. A craniotomy followed by a bilateral external ethmoidectomy was necessary for complete extirpation of the infected mucoceles. Aggressive surgical management of this mycotic infection is described.

"Effect of antileukemia chemotherapy on marrow, blood, and oral granulocyte counts. This study was designed to elicit the effects of antileukemia chemotherapy on marrow production, blood carriage, and oral extravasation of granulocytes, and on the phagocytic activity of those harvested from the mouth. Fifteen adult patients with various morphologic forms of acute leukemia were followed through one to four courses of chemotherapy. Oral saline rinse samples were obtained thrice weekly and prepared for enumeration in a hemocytometer. The oral granulocyte counts were compared with concurrent counts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Phagocytic activity of the oral granulocytes was measured by the method of Smith and Rommel. The 15 patients were followed through 30 courses of chemotherapy and recovery. During each, there was a drug-induced decrease in marrow, blood, and oral granulocytes that was reversed when therapy was discontinued and bone marrow activity was restored. Phagocytic activity of the oral granulocytes was not perceptibly affected by the antileukemic drugs. Oral granulocyte counts provide a noninvasive method for monitoring the onset and recovery of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and granulocytopenia in patients with leukemia.",241,1
"11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione: a marker of adrenal function in hirsutism. To assess the role of the adrenal glands in the development of hirsutism, levels of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11 beta-OHA), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione (delta 4A), and free and total testosterone (T) were measured in 63 hirsute females and 30 control patients. Six of the hirsute patients had basal levels of 11 beta-OHA and 17-OHP and responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone that were significantly greater than these values in controls and the other hirsute women. These women were designated as having an adrenal source for their hirsutism. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and idiopathic hirsutism had normal values of 11 beta-OHA and 17-OHP. Levels of total and free T, DHEAS and delta 4A were significantly higher than control values in all of the hirsute women. This study demonstrates that 11 beta-OHA can be used as a marker to assess the adrenal contribution to hirsutism.",273,1
"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: report of 82 cases. In our initial experience with 82 patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has shown numerous advantages over open cholecystectomy. Both intraoperative blood loss and postoperative need for pain medication have been minimal. Most patients were discharged within 24 to 36 hours and resumed normal activities within 3 to 5 days. The aesthetic aspect is also an obvious advantage, since the laparoscopic procedure avoids disfiguring abdominal scars. Previous abdominal surgery is not a contraindication to attempting this procedure. Based on our experience, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely on most patients who are candidates for open cholecystectomy, including the elderly, the obese, and those with acute gangrenous cholecystitis.",164,0
"Aromatase activity of human granulosa cells in patients with polycystic ovaries treated with dexamethasone. The effect of dexamethasone (DEX) (9 alpha-Fluro-16 alpha-methyl prednisolone) on secretion of steroids by human granulosa luteinized cells was studied by culturing cells from mature follicles of women with polycystic ovarian disease and treated for infertility in the in vitro fertilization program. Patients were treated with DEX 0.5 mg/d until the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration. The cells were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of androstenedione (10(-7)M). After incubating for 24 hours, the medium was replaced and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours. The medium was then harvested and assayed for estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P). Results were compared with those of a control group who was not treated with DEX. Estradiol production by cells was significantly lower in the study group treated with DEX. Progesterone production was not influenced by DEX. Follicular fluid levels, E2, and androgens did not vary with DEX treatment, whereas cortisol levels markedly decreased and P levels increased with the treatment. These findings suggest that glucocorticosteroids can directly influence granulosa luteinized cell function.",272,1

"Assessment of ""squamous cell carcinoma antigen"" (SCC) as a marker of epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal. We measured squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) in epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal in 66 patients. Samples were taken at diagnosis, before treatment, and during follow-up; 353 samples were analyzed. The positive threshold was taken as 2 ng/ml. At diagnosis, the sensitivity of the marker was 44 percent and its specificity 92 percent. In our series, the pretherapeutic level of SCC does not correlate with T as in Papillons' Clinical Staging System, but it does correlate with nodal invasion (P less than 0.05). It is of no prognostic value at the time of diagnosis. During follow-up, at relapse the level of SCC is 20.3 +/- 43 ng/ml. This increase is significant (P less than 0.01): the sensitivity of the marker is 77 percent. In patients who have relapsed, development of the illness correlates with the level of SCC, which is of prognostic value (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, the level of SCC should be associated with the clinical follow-up of patients with epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal.",267,1

"Risks factors for cerebral infarction in good-grade patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery: a prospective study. A prospective series of 265 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Grades I to III (Hunt and Hess classification) upon admission were evaluated as to neurological outcome and computerized tomography (CT) findings 1 to 3 years (mean 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. A total of 73 patients underwent acute surgery (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 86 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 91 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Fifteen patients died before surgery was undertaken and another 20 patients died during the follow-up period. A total of 104 patients received nimodipine and the rest of the patients received either placebo (109 patients) or no medication (52 patients). A logistical regression analysis revealed the following prognostic factors for cerebral infarction, in order of importance: the amount of blood on the primary CT scan; postoperative angiographic vasospasm; the timing of the operation; and a history of hypertension. The use of nimodipine was associated with a significant reduction of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in patients who received intermediate or late surgery. In patients who underwent acute surgery no significant difference between the incidence of cerebral infarcts was observed.",304,0
A case of amnesia after excision of the septum pellucidum. Tumours of the septum pellucidum (SP) are rare and seldom associated with memory impairment either before or after operation.

"Hypercalcemia in malignancy. The pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in malignancy has been enigmatic until recent years. Since the realization in 1980 that bioassays for parathyroid hormone detected a cross-reacting substance in malignancy, progress has been remarkably rapid. A parathyroid hormone-related protein was purified and identified by molecular cloning as a 141-amino acid peptide with limited homology to parathyroid hormone itself. Nonetheless, both peptides activate the parathyroid hormone receptor to produce hypercalcemia. It is now clear that the parathyroid hormone-related protein is the cause of hypercalcemia in most solid tumors, particularly squamous and renal carcinomas. New assays for the hormone as well as the related peptide have greatly simplified the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia. At the same time, new agents for the treatment of hypercalcemia are becoming available, most notably the bisphosphonate drugs.",183,1
"Raynaud's syndrome. Using a range of therapies to help patients. Raynaud's syndrome is a common medical problem. Approach to diagnosis must involve a search for underlying causes.

"Prognostic value of DNA flow cytometry in paragangliomas of the carotid body. A carotid body tumor is a paraganglioma of the carotid bifurcation. Histologic appearance does not correlate with the malignant potential of the lesion, and thus a reliable prognostic marker for these tumors is lacking. To determine whether flow cytometric analysis of paraffin block specimens by DNA index and synthetic phase fraction (SPF) would be of prognostic value, a retrospective chart review of 14 patients with carotid body tumors was performed. Three of 14 tumors were aneuploid and were the only tumors with SPF greater than 15%. One of 3 patients (33%) with an aneuploid tumor (SPF = 22%) developed a local recurrence; no patient with a diploid tumor developed a recurrence. Two of 3 (67%) patients with aneuploid tumors (SPF = 18%) but only 1 of 11 (9%) with a diploid tumor were symptomatic preoperatively (P = 0.03). DNA index and SPF may help select a subgroup of patients with more aggressive tumors who are at increased risk for recurrence and therefore require closer follow-up.",240,1
"Volvulus of the colon. The charts of all patients with colonic volvulus at the University of Louisville Hospitals between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. A total of 45 patients were identified, and there were 17 with cecal volvulus and 29 with sigmoid volvulus (1 had both). Two-thirds of the patients were either demented, bedridden, or used constipating drugs. Initial nonoperative decompression was achieved in 26 of 29 patients with sigmoid volvulus but in only three of nine patients in which it was attempted with cecal volvulus. Two of these recurred, and 16 of the 17 cecal volvulus patients underwent operation. One-third of the sigmoid volvulus patients had at least one recurrent episode on the index admission. Fourteen of the 29 had an operation, and half of these patients died following surgery. Fifteen sigmoid volvulus patients chosen to be treated with successive nonoperative treatment had no mortality. Mortality was higher following emergent (4 of 5) than elective (2 of 9) operation for sigmoid volvulus, and one of three died after operation for a successfully decompressed first episode. Mortality for nonoperative reduction of an early recurrence was zero of four patients, while operative mortality for recurrence was two of seven (all had successful preoperative deflation). There was no mortality or recurrence in four patients with cecal volvulus treated by cecopexy alone, but all three patients died in whom tube cecostomy was performed. Two of nine patients died following right hemicolectomy. These data suggest that if an elective operation is to be performed for sigmoid volvulus, it should be done following one or more recurrences and that nonoperative decompression can be safely performed on successive occasions.",380,0
"Value of retesting subjects with a positive Hemoccult in screening for colorectal cancer. Within a prospective randomized screening study for early detection of colorectal cancer with rehydrated Hemoccult II test, the possibility of increasing the specificity of the test by retesting patients with an initially positive Hemoccult II test was investigated. Of those offered the test 3561 (62.6 per cent) returned it and it was positive in 210 cases (5.9 per cent). The repeat test was performed by 184 patients and was positive in 68 (1.9 per cent). All those with a positive initial test had rectosigmoidoscopy to 60 cm and a double contrast enema. A carcinoma was found in one in seven patients with a positive retest but in only one in 100 patients with a negative retest (P less than 0.001). The specificity of the test was, therefore, increased from 95 per cent to 98 per cent and the sensitivity was unchanged. Rescreening was offered at a later date and increased numbers were available: 7147 patients returned the test and 369 (5.2 per cent) were positive. The test was repeated in 360 patients and 118 (1.7 per cent) were positive. A colorectal neoplasm was found in one in three of those with a positive repeat test, compared with one in seven of those with a negative repeat test. In conclusion, screening for early detection of colorectal cancer with a rehydrated Hemoccult II test may be followed by investigation of only those patients with a positive retest. Such a procedure will reduce the work-load by 60 per cent without reducing sensitivity.",367,1
"Improved biocompatibility by postfixation treatment of aldehyde fixed bovine pericardium. Long-standing release of locally cytotoxic aldehyde concentrations is responsible for lack of spontaneous endothelialization and increased calcification of glutaraldehyde fixed bovine pericardium. Postfixation treatment with amino acids made in vitro endothelialization of bioprosthetic heart valves possible. Such treated pericardium calcified significantly less (13 +/- 4 micrograms/mg dry weight) than did conventionally processed pericardium (114 +/- 25 micrograms/mg) after 63 days of subcutaneous implantation in rats. To test the ability for spontaneous in vivo endothelialization, 5 sheep had 6 mm grafts made from postfixation treated pericardium (PTP) implanted into the carotid artery, compared to PTFE grafts on the contralateral side, which spontaneously endothelialize in animal models. In a pregnant animal, both grafts occluded. All remaining pericardial grafts remained patent, but one additional PTFE graft occluded and another one was stenosed. The area covered with red thrombus was significantly smaller in the PTP grafts (3.05 +/- 3.9%) than in the PTFE grafts 42 +/- 14% (p = 0.0036); TEM and SEM showed endothelial cells growing directly on the PTP, but only on myofibroblasts in PTFE grafts. Postfixation treatment of glutaraldehyde fixed pericardium aids spontaneous endothelialization and decreases tissue calcification.",304,0
"Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome.",202,0
"National survey of the pattern of care for carcinoma of the lung. A national survey of the patterns of care for carcinoma of the lung sponsored by the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons has documented continuing changes in epidemiology, treatment, and outcome. The project consisted of a long-term study of 15,219 patients whose diagnosis was made in 1981 and a short-term study of 19,074 patients whose diagnosis was made in 1986. The male/female incidence ratios have continued to decrease and the decrease has moved into the older age groups. Although the percentage of adenocarcinoma is increasing at the expense of squamous carcinoma, the latter is still the most prevalent histologic type. The accuracy of percutaneous needle biopsy and transbronchial biopsy of lung nodules reported from this group of 941 hospitals was high and equal to that reported by single institutions. The percentage of patients having a resection did not increase from 1981 to 1986, but for smaller lesions a move was apparent toward more lung-sparing resections. Little change has occurred in the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, particularly in stage III disease, where approximately 50% of the patients received postoperative irradiation. An improvement in the overall 5-year survival when compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data was noted. Whether this is a true improvement in survival or is the result of selection because of an unrecognized change in the pattern of care for patients with a carcinoma of the lung is unknown.",316,0
"Human T cell lymphotropic virus infection in Guaymi Indians from Panama. Preliminary studies found that 9% of Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro province have antibody to human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I/II). The present study enrolled 317 (21% of the population) Guaymi Indians from Changuinola, the capital of Bocas del Toro province and 333 (70% of the population) from Canquintu, an isolated rural village. Demographic information and family relationships were ascertained and subjects were screened for neurologic diseases. Serum specimens were screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HTLV-I/II antibody and positives were confirmed according to U.S. Public Health Service criteria. Twenty-five (8%) Guaymi residing in Changuinola and 7 (2.1%) from Canquintu were confirmed seropositive. In Changuinola, antibody was virtually limited to residents greater than or equal to 15 years of age (24 [16%] of 153) and rates were slightly higher in males than in females; in Canquintu, antibody rates did not increase significantly with age and appeared higher in females than in males. In Changuinola, there was no evidence for household clustering of infection. In contrast, HTLV antibody among Canquintu residents clustered significantly by household. HTLV-associated neurologic disease was not detected in either population. The atypical seroepidemiology observed in both locations might be explained if the virus endemic to the Guaymi differed from HTLV-I previously described in the Caribbean basin and Japan.",336,0
"Bacteremia with otitis media. To investigate the occurrence and outcome of bacteremia associated with otitis media, charts were reviewed from patients who were 3 to 36 months of age, had temperatures greater than or equal to 39 degrees C, and were diagnosed with isolated clinical otitis media. A total of 2982 patients were identified. Blood cultures were obtained from 1666 (56%). Of the 1666 patients, who had blood drawn for cultures, 50 (3.0%) had bacteremia. These included 39 with Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 with Haemophilus influenzae, 2 with Neisseria meningitidis, 3 with Salmonella species, and 2 with Staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of bacteremia increased at higher temperatures, being 1.9% at temperatures less than or equal to 40 degrees C and 5.0% at temperatures greater than 40 degrees C. Younger children were more likely to have bacteremia; 3.7% less than or equal to 12 months of age, 2.4% 13 to 24 months of age, and 1.9% 25 to 36 months of age had blood culture results that were positive (not significant). Reevaluation of the 50 bacteremic patients showed that 9 patients had continued fever, 3 patients had persistent bacteremia, pneumonia developed in 1 patient, and meningitis developed in 1 patient. It was concluded that (1) 3% of young febrile children with otitis media have bacteremia at the time of evaluation, a rate comparable to that previously reported in children with no focus of infection; (2) the incidence of bacteremia increases at higher temperatures; and (3) most febrile children with otitis media do well. The clinician must therefore weigh the potential benefit of drawing a blood culture to identify children at risk for complications against the inherent cost, inconvenience, and discomfort.",414,0
"The relationship between hypochondriasis and medical illness. Forty-one Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised hypochondriacs were accrued from a primary care practice. Seventy-five control subjects were selected at random from among the remainder of the patients in the same clinic. All subjects completed a structured diagnostic interview and standardized self-report questionnaires. Medical morbidity was assessed with a medical record audit and with primary physicians' ratings. The hypochondriacal and comparison samples did not differ in aggregate medical morbidity, although the hypochondriacal sample had more undiagnosed complaints and nonspecific findings in their medical records. Within the comparison sample, higher levels of medical morbidity were associated with higher levels of hypochondriacal symptoms. This occurred primarily because the most serious medical disorders were associated with more bodily preoccupation, disease conviction, and somatization. Within the hypochondriacal sample, no correlation was found between the degree of hypochondriasis and the extent of medical morbidity. ",200,0

"Risks factors for cerebral infarction in good-grade patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery: a prospective study. A prospective series of 265 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Grades I to III (Hunt and Hess classification) upon admission were evaluated as to neurological outcome and computerized tomography (CT) findings 1 to 3 years (mean 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. A total of 73 patients underwent acute surgery (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 86 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 91 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Fifteen patients died before surgery was undertaken and another 20 patients died during the follow-up period. A total of 104 patients received nimodipine and the rest of the patients received either placebo (109 patients) or no medication (52 patients). A logistical regression analysis revealed the following prognostic factors for cerebral infarction, in order of importance: the amount of blood on the primary CT scan; postoperative angiographic vasospasm; the timing of the operation; and a history of hypertension. The use of nimodipine was associated with a significant reduction of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in patients who received intermediate or late surgery. In patients who underwent acute surgery no significant difference between the incidence of cerebral infarcts was observed.",304,0
"Increasing asthma prevalence in a rural New Zealand adolescent population: 1975-89. A survey of asthma symptoms and spirometry in 435 adolescent schoolchildren was undertaken in 1989 in a rural, largely Maori population. The survey questionnaires were identical to those used in a 1975 survey at the same school. The prevalence of reported asthma or wheeze significantly increased from 26.2% to 34.0%. This increase occurred in groups reporting asthma, and also those reporting wheeze unassociated with colds, but without a previous diagnosis of asthma. There was a tendency for a rise in reported wheeze in Europeans (24.3% to 27.4%) and a significant rise in Maoris (27.1% to 36.2%). The reclassification of other respiratory problems did not account for the increase. Data from this study provides evidence that there has been a rise in the prevalence of asthma in this New Zealand population over a time period of 14 years.",216,0
"Nerve growth factor stimulates protein tyrosine phosphorylation in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. The cellular actions of nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) may be mediated by changes in protein phosphorylation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of two predominant proteins of molecular mass 40 and 42 kDa is seen in PC-12 cells treated with NGF or EGF, correlating with activation of a previously identified serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein (MAP). Stimulation of phosphoprotein (pp) 40 and 42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activity by NGF but not EGF is selectively attenuated by staurosporine and K-252A. Moreover, the time courses of pp40/42 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation produced by NGF or EGF are identical. Chromatography of lysates from growth factor-treated cells on ion-exchange or hydrophobic-interaction HPLC resolves MAP kinase into two peaks, neither of which precisely coelutes with pp40 or pp42. One of these peaks (II) exhibits no detectable phosphotyrosine. The other peak (I) has some overlap with pp40. However, the activity residing in both peaks is almost completely inhibited after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that, at least, serine/threonine phosphorylation is required for the activity of these enzymes. These data indicate that while tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be a critical early event in NGF action, the role of this modification in activation of MAP kinases remains unclear.",315,1
"Diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Clinical importance, surgical treatment, and follow-up study. A diffuse sclerosing variant is not very rare among papillary carcinomas of the thyroid when the patients are female and younger than 30 years of age. The variant is characterized by diffuse involvement of one or both thyroid lobes, with dense sclerosis, patchy lymphocytic infiltration, and abundant psammoma bodies. Controversy still exists concerning its prognosis. We reviewed our experience with 14 patients treated between 1958 and 1988. All patients were young females, their age being from 10 to 28 years with a mean of 19.6. Hashimoto's thyroiditis had been suspected in nine patients before they came to our clinic. Nowadays the diagnosis of this cancer is possible when we have this entity in mind and detect abundant psammoma bodies either by ultrasonography or by soft-tissue roentgenography of the neck. Total thyroidectomy with modified neck dissection was carried out in eight patients, subtotal thyroidectomy with neck dissection in five, and lobectomy with neck dissection in one. All of them are alive and well without distant metastasis at a mean follow-up of 16 years. Because most of the patients with this variant of papillary carcinoma are young women and the prognosis is favorable, a complete resection without causing later recurrence, but also cosmetic and complication-free surgery, should be considered.",304,1
"Paraneoplastic brachial plexopathy in a patient with Hodgkin's disease. We describe a case of inflammatory brachial plexopathy that occurred in the context of a mild, diffuse sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy associated with Hodgkin's disease. Clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic studies helped distinguish this disorder from other causes of brachial plexopathy in patients with cancer. Treatment with corticosteroids seemed beneficial in this patient. We suggest that this may be another type of paraneoplastic condition associated with Hodgkin's disease. ",106,0
"Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia Gravis is a disorder of neuromuscular function resulting from an immunologically based premature destruction of acetylcholine receptors. The disease is characterized clinically by variable weakness accentuated by repetitive muscular activity and usually responding to the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Myasthenia Gravis is a complex disease and requires understanding of the many facets of its natural history and immunological basis to ensure optimal individual patient management. The long-term goal is control of the immunological imbalance; treatment regimens include thymectomy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis. The common use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provides symptomatic relief during variable daily muscular activity. Disability due to myasthenia gravis is to a large extent reversible and death is preventable. Early recognition of myasthenia gravis and appropriate treatment are often rewarded by remission that may be permanent. ",176,0
"A hepatoblastoma originating in the caudate lobe radically resected with the inferior vena cava. Complete resection of a rare hepatoblastoma in the caudate lobe, involving the inferior vena cava (IVC), is reported. After systemic chemotherapy, a 5-year-old child underwent exploratory laparotomy at another hospital, but resection was not attempted because the tumor in the caudate lobe had extensively invaded the retrohepatic IVC. However, because not only the lack of distant metastases but also the establishment of extrahepatic collaterals were confirmed by imaging, we thought it was possible to radically resect the tumor. We successfully performed an extended left hepatic lobectomy including total excision of the caudate lobe and the involved portion of the IVC. Although we did not reconstruct the IVC, no clinical manifestations arising from caval congestion were seen. The serum alpha-fetoprotein value declined below the normal limit. Our experience with this case has introduced a radical resectability for hepatic malignancy in the caudate lobe, even if it has extended into the IVC.",216,1

Our case is remarkable because a stage I squamous cell carcinoma developed on the shaft of the penis of a neonatally circumcised man.

"Vascularized full-thickness parietal bone grafts in maxillofacial reconstruction: the role of the galea and superficial temporal vessels. Reconstruction of bony structures of the face is always a problem as big as the defect and the function that must be replaced. Everything from simple grafts to sophisticated distant bone flaps has been used. Based on the studies of Cutting et al., Psillakis et al., and Casanova et al., we have developed the full-thickness galeoparietal bone flap, initially for mandibular reconstruction, but of great use for all maxillofacial reconstructions. From July of 1987 to December of 1988, 14 patients have been operated on. The experience with this flap is shown in four patients as follows: primary reconstruction of a mandible as a result of ameloblastoma, secondary reconstruction of a mandible with associated old fractures and malalignment of segments, bilateral malar reconstruction in a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome, and severe sequelae of an already treated Romberg case. Small variations could be made to best accommodate the technique used to the defect we were treating. Some technical details, the experience, the results, and possible sequelae or complications are also discussed.",248,1
"Stress and sodium intake in neural control of renal function in hypertension. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors is important in the pathophysiology of hypertension. By examining the effects of two environmental factors--acute psychoemotional stress and dietary sodium intake--in rats with genetic hypertension, an important influence on central neural mechanisms governing the renal sympathetic neural control of renal function has been demonstrated. Additional studies of the central opioid systems have demonstrated an important role of opioid peptides in modulating the renal functional responses to acute psychoemotional stress. The observed renal functional alterations--antidiuresis, antinatriuresis, and renal vasoconstriction--are known to be capable of contributing to the initiation, development, and maintenance of the hypertensive process.

"Characterization in vitro of a human tumor necrosis factor-binding protein. A soluble form of a tumor necrosis factor receptor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic mediator of inflammatory responses. A cysteine-rich, highly glycosylated 30-kD TNF-binding protein (TNF-BP) purified from urine may have a role in regulation because it protects in vitro against the biological effects of TNF. The cytotoxic effect of TNF on the fibrosarcoma cell line WEHI 164 was inhibited by 50% at a 10-fold excess of TNF-BP. The binding of TNF to the receptor was partially reversed after the addition of TNF-BP. Results from biosynthetic labeling of cells with 35S-cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TNF-BP indicated that TNF-BP is formed and released at the cell surface by cleavage because no corresponding cellular polypeptide was observed. A cellular 60-kD polypeptide, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-TNF-BP, may correspond to the transmembrane TNF-receptor molecule and be the precursor of TNF-BP. Thus, TNF-BP appears to be a soluble form of a transmembrane TNF-receptor. Moreover our results demonstrate that the production of TNF-BP is increased when the TNF receptor is downregulated in cells by treatment with TNF or by activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters. TNF-BP may be an important agent that blocks harmful effects of TNF, and, therefore, useful in clinical applications.",309,1
"Adult and pediatric peritonitis rates in a home dialysis program: comparison of continuous ambulatory and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis. We reviewed our 115-month experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) in adult and pediatric patients to determine whether there is a difference in the incidence of peritonitis between patients performing CAPD or CCPD. Peritonitis rates were similar in patients performing CAPD or CCPD in both the adult and pediatric age groups. The overall CAPD peritonitis rate was significantly lower in adult patients when compared with pediatric patients. There was no difference in peritonitis rates for CCPD between adult and pediatric patients. When the data are divided into 3-year subgroups, the incidence of peritonitis is significantly lower in adult patients undergoing either CAPD or CCPD when compared with pediatric patients during the years 1986 to 1988. There is significant improvement over time in the incidence of peritonitis in both adult and pediatric patients performing CCPD; similarly, there is a trend toward improvement in patients performing CAPD. Staphylococcus species organisms remain the most common bacterial cause of peritonitis, except in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years or with nephrostomies, where gram-negative rod infections were more common. Peritonitis resulted in discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis in a greater number of adult patients. These results suggest that the number of catheter manipulations is not important in determining the incidence of peritonitis. Pediatric patients are more likely than adult patients to develop peritonitis with either CAPD or CCPD. Adult patients are more likely than pediatric patients to discontinue peritoneal dialysis secondary to peritonitis.",337,0
"Contemporary management of a potentially lethal fetal anomaly: a successful perinatal approach to epignathus. Prenatal diagnosis of epignathus (a teratoma originating in the oropharynx) has been reported previously. However, in many of these cases the neonates succumbed to acute respiratory distress secondary to airway obstruction at the time of birth. We describe a case of antepartum diagnosis of epignathus using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging as complementary techniques. The ability to accurately define the fetal anomaly permitted us to plan a unique strategy for peripartum management. After cesarean delivery of the infant from the uterus, the umbilical cord was not clamped and the fetoplacental circulation was left undisturbed. A tracheostomy was then performed, after which the umbilical cord was clamped and the infant was stabilized. Several hours later, a debulking procedure was performed in the operating room to remove the tumor from its attachment to the bony palate. Both mother and infant did well postoperatively. The ability to plan and perform a controlled tracheostomy while the infant remained oxygenated and ventilated proved to be lifesaving in this case. ",226,1
"Recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy associated with a fatty-acid oxidation defect in the offspring. A case of a 29-year-old woman who has had two episodes both clinically and biochemically consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy is described. These episodes occurred in two successive pregnancies, and liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in the second pregnancy. Both pregnancies were managed by prompt fetal delivery; on both occasions this led to a complete biochemical resolution of the liver function abnormalities. Two healthy babies were delivered by ceasarian sections. This case is of particular importance because a rapidly progressive and devastating illness developed in both infants, leading to death at 6 1/2 and 6 months, respectively. The illness in both babies was characterized by wide-spread fatty infiltration of several vital organs and a failure of any treatment to influence the outcome of that illness. Studies suggested that the illness in the children was caused by a still ill-defined disorder of fatty acid oxidation. The biochemical disorder evidenced in this family is discussed, in an attempt to shed light on the etiology of acute fatty liver of pregnancy.",222,0
"Primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder: favorable prognostic significance of deoxyribonucleic acid diploidy measured by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy analysis was done successfully on 38 specimens of primary bladder adenocarcinoma treated between 1954 and 1985. Of the specimens 10 (26%) were deoxyribonucleic acid diploid, 8 (21%) were tetraploid and 20 (53%) were aneuploid. Distribution of ploidy patterns between the 14 histological low grade and 24 high grade tumors was similar. Of 38 tumors 35 (92%) showed muscle invasion. One tumor arose in a previously exstrophied bladder, 10 were of urachal origin and 27 arose in an anatomically normal bladder. Of the urachal origin tumors 80% were deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploid. At 5 and 10 years after diagnosis 80 and 70%, respectively, of the patients with diploid tumors were free of disease. By contrast, at 5 and 10 years after treatment only 20 and 12%, respectively, of the patients with nondiploid tumors have not had disease progression (p less than 0.001 log-rank test). None of the 6 patients with diploid, high grade, high stage, muscle invasive tumors had subsequent progression. In contrast, 16 of 17 patients (94%) with high grade, high stage, nondiploid tumors had either local or distant tumor recurrence (p less than 0.0005). Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern appears to be the most significant prognostic information currently available to stratify expected prognosis for patients with muscle invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder. This test probably should be a standard tool in the clinical management of patients with this rare bladder malignancy.",396,1
"Epidermoid cysts of the brain stem. Report of three cases. The authors report the cases of three patients with epidermoid cysts which insinuated themselves into the brain stem. In all three patients, the tumor occupied the pons, although in one it was predominantly located in the medulla. The cyst contents and nonadherent tumor capsule were removed in all three patients, but no attempt was made to remove tumor densely adherent to the brain stem. One patient's cyst was removed in one operation, but maximal resection in the other two required two operations. After surgery, sixth nerve function completely returned in one patient; another patient had a stable pontine gaze palsy but developed new facial weakness; and the third patient had stable cranial nerve deficits with a diminished hemiparesis. The last patient developed a pseudomeningocele and communicating hydrocephalus, and required a lumboperitoneal shunt. In all three patients, computerized tomography scans demonstrated hypodense tumors not enhanced by contrast material. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on two patients; in both, the tumors showed increased signal intensity relative to brain on T1-weighted images and decreased signal intensity relative to brain on T2-weighted studies. Magnetic resonance imaging, the most accurate modality for localizing these lesions and determining their extent, was also invaluable for postoperative monitoring and follow-up evaluation. Safe and adequate resection includes decompression of cyst contents and removal of nonadherent portions of the cyst capsule. Cyst wall adherent to the brain stem, however, should not be removed.",303,0
"Imaging of a parapharyngeal hemangiopericytoma. Radioimmunoscintigraphy (SPECT) with indium-111-labeled anti-CEA antibody, and comparison to digital subtraction angiography, computed tomography, and immunohistochemistry. A 27-year-old male patient with a parapharyngeal hemangiopericytoma was investigated radiologically with orthopantomography, computed tomography, and digital subtraction angiography before the operation. Because a malignancy was suspected, the patient was imaged with gamma camera using radiolabeled monoclonal anticarcinoembryonal antigen antibody including single photon emission computed tomography. The radioantibody accumulated strongly into the neoplasm. Tumor to background ratio was 2.2. Samples of the excised tumor were stained immunohistochemically for desmin, vimentin, muscle actin, cytokeratin, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), and factor VIII. They showed that the antibody uptake was of unspecific nature and not due to CEA expression in the tumor.",201,1
"Angiocentric immunoproliferative lesion/T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome: a case report and review of the literature. The lesions known as lymphocytic vasculitis, polymorphic reticulosis (midline malignant reticulosis, lethal midline granuloma), lymphomatoid granulomatosis, and angiocentric lymphoma form what have been collectively termed the angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions (AIL). Because of recent reports demonstrating clonal rearrangements of the T-cell receptor in these lesions, the AIL are now thought to represent a continuous spectrum of post-thymic T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) represents intermediate or high-grade B-cell malignancies in HIV-infected patients that may be etiologically related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). There have been reports of EBV-associated T-cell NHL, AIL, and large granular lymphocyte (LGL) proliferations, as well as HIV-associated T-cell neoplasia, LGL/T-cell proliferations, and AIL. We describe a case of polymorphic reticulosis (lethal midline granuloma) arising in an HIV-infected individual, who later progressed to AIDS, and review the literature on HIV-associated and EBV-associated T-cell neoplasia, LGL/T-cell proliferations, and AIL. The etiology of this AIL/T-cell NHL, especially in relation to EBV and HIV, is discussed. ",324,1
"Intracranial tumor in infants: characteristics, management, and outcome of a contemporary series. Since 1980, 22 patients less than 2 years of age have been treated for intracranial tumors at our institution. The most common presentation was elevated intracranial pressure associated with ventriculomegaly (73%). The diagnosis was made by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed surgically in every case. In 68% of cases, the tumor involved midline structures in the central nervous system. Tumors were infratentorial in 29% of patients less than 1 year of age and in 60% of those more than 1 year of age. Most tumors were either primitive neuroectodermal tumors (41%, 7 of 9 located in midline posterior fossa structures) or astrocytomas (27%, 5 of 6 located in the hypothalamus, chiasm, or optic nerve). Twenty patients had gross or subtotal tumor resection. Surgical mortality and neurological morbidity were 10% and 5%, respectively. Of 5 patients who underwent a second operation for tumor recurrence, 3 demonstrated a change in the pathological features of the tumor from those of the original diagnosis. Of 10 surgical survivors with malignant tumors, 8 received chemotherapy and 5 radiation therapy. Radiation was not administered before 1 year of age. The overall 1-year survival was 70%, and 2-year survival was 58%. Two-year survival for benign and malignant tumors was not significantly different. We think that the interdisciplinary efforts directed toward the treatment of these tumors has improved survival and that all children should be offered entry to a research protocol and aggressive treatment.",346,1
"Effect of antileukemia chemotherapy on marrow, blood, and oral granulocyte counts. This study was designed to elicit the effects of antileukemia chemotherapy on marrow production, blood carriage, and oral extravasation of granulocytes, and on the phagocytic activity of those harvested from the mouth. Fifteen adult patients with various morphologic forms of acute leukemia were followed through one to four courses of chemotherapy. Oral saline rinse samples were obtained thrice weekly and prepared for enumeration in a hemocytometer. The oral granulocyte counts were compared with concurrent counts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Phagocytic activity of the oral granulocytes was measured by the method of Smith and Rommel. The 15 patients were followed through 30 courses of chemotherapy and recovery. During each, there was a drug-induced decrease in marrow, blood, and oral granulocytes that was reversed when therapy was discontinued and bone marrow activity was restored. Phagocytic activity of the oral granulocytes was not perceptibly affected by the antileukemic drugs. Oral granulocyte counts provide a noninvasive method for monitoring the onset and recovery of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and granulocytopenia in patients with leukemia.",241,1
"Spectral electroretinography in thioridazine toxicity. In three patients with thioridazine toxicity, the electroretinogram (ERG) to red light was found to be below the average normal range. A significant increase in its amplitude appeared with cessation of therapy in two cases. A further deterioration of the ERG amplitude to all stimulus conditions (white, blue, and red lights) occurred when the dose of the medication was increased in the third patient. ",93,0
"Clinical features and associations of 560 cases of motor neuron disease. In 560 cases of motor neuron disease, studied retrospectively from their case notes in three teaching centres, the age at onset ranged from 13 to 87 years (mean 56 years), and the mean duration of illness until death was 2.6 years. In the subgroup of the disease presenting with progressive bulbar palsy presenting after age 59 years, there was a previously unrecognised excess of females sufficient to equalize the sex ratio of incidence of the disease in this age group. No potentially causative clinical associations emerged; no relation was noted between occupational exposure to leather products, trauma or surgical procedures and the disease. There was a trend for patients with motor neuron disease to give a history of abstention from alcohol.",167,0
