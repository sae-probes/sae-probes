If this is accurate, then you can afford to be a bit more lenient with the calls, knowing that you have another chance coming up soon. In fact, the head coach may even tell the play caller to use all four downs during the first down play. Let's see if that's the case as they try to pick up the yards on third down, but there's a flag on the play.

"""Attacking every quadrant deeply, that is what the people in this Oklahoma office are doing. They have enough weapons to bring down Lincoln's rally, aiming for their eighth play of the drive. Mixing up players in the backfield now, it's second down and they're feeling confident. Below the pad, Shepard makes a move and runs inside the 15-yard line, down to the 11. Reading the zone defense perfectly, he gets between the safety and linebacker and watches as Dylan Evans, number 54, tries to make a tackle. Shepard's third catch of the night, the quick pass to Quick, is aimed at the endzone for a touchdown. And what a block by Jarvis Baxter! It's his first collegiate catch.""",158,1

However, at this level, you face stronger and faster defenders who can tackle you behind the line of scrimmage when you run in the wrong direction. The Bears did just that when James Robinson tried to run backward. It was good to see him back on the field after being out for a month due to a hamstring injury sustained during the South Dakota game. Unfortunately, Colby was sacked at the 26-yard line by Chris Chambers in a third-down passing situation. Chambers, weighing around 230 pounds, played a tough game in the luck position this Saturday.""",147,1

"Although these results suggest that a deep learning approach may be beneficial in the development of clinical reasoning skill through its potential to enhance the development of knowledge representations, the substantial shift towards a surface learning approach brings into question previous conclusions that PBL curricula foster a deep approach to learning, and suggests that other factors, such as work load may be more determinants of learning approach than curriculum type. Taken together, these findings emphasise the context-dependent nature of learning approach as well as the importance of assessment as a driver of student learning and strongly suggest that further work to determine precisely the factors which influence learning approach in medical students is urgently needed.",125,0

Earlier, we discussed the weight loss of Matt Grothe, which amounts to approximately 1518 pounds since the offseason, and it certainly aids in his mobility on the field. As we head into the end of the first quarter, it's 14-3 South Florida, and they're once again on the march.
