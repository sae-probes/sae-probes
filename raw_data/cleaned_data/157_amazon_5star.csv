"Title: Great fun
Review: I was able to get two seasons of this from my library, and  I went over budget to  buy this whole set.  Richard Griffiths died this year - what a loss !  His Inspector Crabbe is a wonderful character.  Malcolm Sinclair as hissenior officer/former friend and all of the other supporting characters are great.  It was fun in the first season to see the future Inspector Foyle as a master criminal !!  The restaurant, his wonderful wife and his chickens and the produce man - all make for mysteries with fun which can be watched over and over again.",1
"Title: Not good at all.
Review: This is a ‘Verified Purchase’ I made on Amazon but strangely there is no link to write my review. So I’m writing this without the Verified Purchase thingy.<br /><br />Anyway, the charger LOOKS solid, the gold is nice and looks high-end. But it snags the hair on my long hair when I tried to trim the ends. Tried again to give buzz cut on someone else and he said it pulled out his hair! Like it snags and doesn’t glide well at all.<br /><br />Not worth the price point. Especially when I have a cheaper one at home that outperforms this one even without that fancy Ferrari motor.<br /><br />The search for the perfect one continues.",0
"Title: Nice bag, good size
Review: Unlike others I find this bag to be a very good size.  Not too small yet not too large it holds everything I'd need on a trip.  There's room for the shaver, beard trimmer, and other toiletries I typically take on a trip.  The 2 larger pockets are quite nice and supposedly water proof (I've not tested this but they look like they'd be).  The 2 smaller zipper pockets should hold smaller medicine containers but are on the same side of the bag making them not quite as useful as they seem.  Still, they're OK for the intended uses.<br /><br />The leather is a good quality and soft with strong stitching.  The handle can work from one end or the top and each large compartment has its own zipper (not a dual affair like other's I've used).  I like th",1
"Title: Excessively stupid software
Review: I ordered the DataPilot Universal kit for OSX; this contains USB adapters for a wide variety of phones. Let me say up front that the one cable I tried (Motorola E815) worked fine; and that DataPilot did recognize my phone at once.<br /><br />The DataPilot software is another matter. My aim was to transfer pictures from a camera phone to the computer (since Verizon provides no other means of doing so except to email the picture to yourself at 25cents each). With what I have spent on the DataPilot I could have emailed more than 300 pictures to myself, and the results would have been just as satisfactory if not more so.<br /><br />DataPilot downloaded my phone's address book data, but it apparently doesn't know about the Categories feature of ",0
"Title: Awesome connector for getting sound into your mixing console
Review: I accidentally got this because I thought that it was the connector that I needed to get my sound from a condenser mic into my computer. I was wrong. This is the wrong connector for that task. But, this is the right connector to get sound from your computer or handheld voice recorder into a mixing console.<br /><br />So, if you know what you're getting, this connector is great! It's well put together, and doesn't rattle around at all. There was no interference at all from this connector. I really recommend it, and Hosa has made a great connector with this.",1

Review: This is a very fun toy. They played with it for a while, and had a lot of fun.<br /><br />We have many toys from this company. They make a lot of different products and we have generally been very happy with them. It worked well.<br /><br />This toy was durable. My kids can be a little rough with toys, but this continued to work just fine. We had no problems<br /><br />It was very bright and colorful.<br /><br />I feel like this is good for child development. It kept my children's interest. It would also make a nice gift.<br /><br />I would recommend it.",1
"Title: BETTER OFF BUYING THE SPLURGE
Review: For the most part it does the job. However, the legs do squeeze your thighs so that’s noticeable under tight clothing like bodycon dresses/etc. I’m also not a fan of the huge hole at the crotch because you’ll<br />still feel the need to wear underwear under the suit (otherwise you’ll see panty lines if worn over the suit which defeats the purpose) which makes going to the bathroom very difficult. I also don’t like how thick the straps are and that you can’t adjust them. So, I returned it & splurged on the brand name version even tho it was SO pricey BUT, in the end it was completely worth every cent and I wear it very often. Ok product if ur in a pinch financially, good condition, fast shipping! If you found my review helpful, I would appre",0
"Title: Good Bang For Your Buck
Review: Let me start off by saying that I am using the M-Audio EX-P for my guitar pedal; Boss SYB-5. I found it ironic that this is for a keyboard but it fails to work on my Casio while succeeds with working for my SYB-5 ( Synth pedal). Nonetheless, I got this pedal specifically for my pedals, not my keyboard. The EX-P has held up really well so far, dropped about 2 times. It is made out of plastic and has a rubber grip for the foot-switch. It comes with a knob to adjust the range of the delay, sound or whatever you need it for, which is pretty nice to have. It works great with all my Boss pedals and I have not yet tried it on any other brand. Overall I am very satisfied with this pedal, for the price you can't go wrong with it.<br /><br />Pros : C",1
"Title: The Not so Incredible Hulk
Review: Thee worst marvel film I ever had the misfortune of sitting through. I am stunned at just how boring this film was. Yet the masses here on amazon love this?<br /><br />I wish I could wave a wand to make everyone hate this film, as wrong as that is, I still wish it. That is how bad this movie is. This should be a Guinness world record for most boring movie ever or something. =D<br /><br />Most who didn't like the film seem to rant about the actor Norton. I don't care who is playing as hulk in this film, it's just boring because it's boring. A weak story, and lame plot.<br /><br />Hulk mad... hulk very mad... hulk smash this dvd!<br /><br />EDIT--- nobody like this review? well I am not sorry, this film was awful!

"Title: I loved these compression socks from the minute I put them on!
Review: I loved these compression socks from the minute I put them on. Plus, you get TWO pairs of socks instead of one. BONUS!!<br /><br />They are not too tight and not too loose. It’s sometimes hard to find a decent compression sock that isn’t as tight as a 15-20mmHg or as loose as anything bigger.<br /><br />Also, I wear a size 6 women’s size sock which the average size is 8+. These socks fit properly, which is an almost nil, as socks are made for averages.<br /><br />I wore these for one entire day while on my feet. As a personal trainer I get an average of 12,000 steps per day. Then you count in my personal workouts to include running, jumping, weight lifting, step aerobics, cardio kick, high repetition weight lifting, sport yoga, core trainin",1
"Title: Great for one season, then the wooden handle broke.  Horrible CUSTOMER SERVICE.  AVOID THIS BRAND.
Review: Loved the shovel for the first few snow falls.  GREAT blade and ice/snow removal.  Wooden handle broke recently and I tried contacting Garant.  They are in Canada.  They would not uphold the 1 year warranty and peddled me off to AMES their US company/rep.  AMES couldn't offer any warranty and claimed Garant doesn't ship parts to the US.  What kind of horrible service is this???  WARRANTY MEANS NOTHING here and they do no care about customer satisfaction as evidenced by their inability to satisfy my valid warranty claim.  If you like the shovels, just buy a few of them as spares.  They sell them here as well as ACE.",0
"Title: If you NEED to get to sleep, take these.
Review: If you have less than 8 hours from pillow to dressing in the morning, do not take but a 1/2 tablet. If you have more than 8 hours (10hrs'ish), take 1 full tablet and you won't have any groggy feeling when you're ready to rise and shine.<br /><br />I find that neither keeps me from tossing/turning through the night, but both allow me to fall back asleep should I awake during the night whereas taking 5mg or even 10mg of melatonin, while allowing me to fall asleep JUST as quickly as this Sleep Aid, the melatonin doesn't ensure that should I awake in the middle of the night, I'll be able to fall back asleep.<br /><br />The difference between the Melatonin and Sleep Aid for me is the former has 0 groggy feelings to it, whereas Sleep Aid COULD le",1
"Title: semi disposable slippers
Review: I just put in new flooring and I don't want outdoor shoes inside... so I purchased these for guests ... for the price they are 5 star.  However, they are really semi disposable - not very thick or comfy. But they'd do for a short visit.  I also offer the slip-over shoe covers - they may actually be more useful in the long run for most people - but these are very cute at our beach house.  There are 4 size ""large"" (estimate a 10-11 womens - maybe 9-10 mens?)  slipper sets and 4 size ""medium"" ( estimate about an 8-9 womens size). I personally found them fairly wide - I have normal width feet. They are bright white thin terry tops with slightly non-skid, textured soles.  The decoration is embroidered sea life items.  I never hesitate to update ",1
"Title: Poor quality. While it does offer some nice features
Review: Poor quality.  While it does offer some nice features, the lack of quality diminishes it all.<br />-For an Air Gun, this thing has a lot of kick.<br />-Trigger position is bad, if you just place the finger on the trigger like on any other gun and start squeezing it, the finger will quickly run in to the upper deck preventing the full squeeze, so have to remember to place the finger on the very tip/bottom of the trigger to make a shot.  Imagine this will be even more problematic if wearing gloves.<br />- Scope is absolutely horrible.<br />  * Mounting - does not stay in place even when screws are super tight (I imagine this is due to the amount of kick this rifle has), so when you think you got done sighting it in and make few more shots, yo",0
"Title: My dog won’t eat these chews.
Review: I was very disappointed in the Cosquin chews.  They are full of good things for senior dogs, especially those that have arthritis.  I tried for 2 weeks to get my senior dog to eat these and she completely refused.  I end up crushing them up with her food and she still would not eat them.  I just order the Cosquin round tablets that I was giving her before.  This is a great supplements for dogs with arthritis or joint problems.  Highly recommend the tabs, which you cut in half and she loves to eat them.<br />Maybe it’s just my dog, your’s may like the chews.",0
"Title: It was Nice quality, at first
Review: 10.2ft was long in this case. We replaced the battery operated string lights for these, and it's well worth it! No more dying batteries!! Plus, the remote function is a very cool feature! My 5 year old loves his new lights, and they also dim and make for a great nite lite.<br /><br />Update 2/11/2020: It's been less than a year and several of the bulbs have completely burned out. The rest of the lights are super dim, as if the integrity and quality of the product was questionable. They look nice, but they no longer function as they did 7 months ago!!",0
"Title: Does not capture all motion
Review: It is spotty on motion detection capturing. There are distinct events that it just does not capture..  The night vision is pretty decent though. If you opt in & pay for cloud service, you will not get it. I paid for and did not receive cloud service all last year and they just tried to automatically charge my card for another year of service. I tried multiple times to email them about not receiving cloud service and never got a response, nor a refund.  I will be switching to a different company that has more of a reputation behind them.

Very Skin-Friendly and Comfortable to Wear.<br />Super Soft Floral Print Fabric and Elastic Empire Waist Makes the Flowy Dress Soft and Stretch.""  That's what was described.  But NONE of it is accurate!  There is not a stitch of Spandex in this fabric - it's more like a cheaply-woven linen-like fabric.  Oh, wait!  It IS lightweght!  There is NO elastic in the ""empire waist.  The fabric is not skin-friendly.  The top of the dress fits well enough (but there is absolutely no stretch, so I don't think it would be comfortable for more than 10 minutes.  But the part of the dress below the bustline is HUGE!

"Title: Gorgeous!
Review: This is one of the most beautiful summer tops I've ever seen.  The fit is flattering and it's just long enough to work well with leggings.  I really like that the bodice provides some modesty also since I will wear this at work throughout the summer.  I've ordered a second one in another color.<br /><br />I washed it before the first wearing since it seems that the fabric has some overdie that got on my hands.  I used plain white vinegar to set the colors.  They are still vivid and I will be washing it by hand to keep it that way.",1

Review: Well, disclaimer -- I'm no expert at tingshaw chimes, but I am a classical musician, so I do know about sounds ;)<br /><br />These feel good, are very solid, heavy, and make a nice ringing sound.<br /><br />My guess is all these chimes make different tones.  I used a sound analyzer to listen to the frequencies, and they were VERY DIFFERENT frequencies than what other people analyzed here.....  so I'm not going to bother to post them (I forgot, and I'm to lazy to retest) -- bottom line is, YOU GET WHAT YOU GET, AND BE HAPPY WITH IT... or return them.",1
"Title: Terrible execution of a good idea

"Title: Fashionable and trendy.
Review: Starter is a brand that has been around for a while. I always considered Starter to be a brand known for athletic apparel, so I think this bomber style jacket is a nice addition to the collection. It is black (the Starter logo is on the breast pocket) with white accents (along the neck and cuff).  It zips down the front with snaps at the waist. There is a quilted lining that has therma-star (enhances heat) and dri-star (keeps away moisture) technologies. It is light weight and versatile, so you can layer when it is cold (with a hoodie or sweater) or wear it with a t-shirt. You can wear it with jeans or khakis. The fabric (100% polyester) does have a little shine, but I think that is what makes it cute. Overall, if you can afford it, I think",1

Review: This program is super!  I've tried a couple of different file browser apps and this one seems to do things a bit better than the rest.  It supports browsing and managing files on remote machines and streaming the files to an audio or video player so you don't have to download the file to listen or watch it.  I used to have a seperate app for bluetooth, ftp, etc but this program does it all.  I've also been using this app to connect to my cloud storage on amazon s3.

"Title: Solid and Well Made Cast Iron Casserole
Review: I do a lot with cast iron and prefer it to coated non-stick cookware most of the time. This is the very first 13""x9"" cast iron pan I have ever seen and so far I am very pleased with it. It's a solid product and worth its asking price.<br /><br />Lodge is the largest and most well-known cast iron foundry still in operation in the US. They produce quality products and this one is no exception. This is a solid and hefty casserole pan and it is made to last a lifetime and beyond. I have never had trouble with any Lodge cast iron (though to be fair, it is not indestructible and can be broken). Looking my pan over I found no pores, holes, or burrs, and the finish is uniform.<br /><br />This is a preseasoned pan, and I think a lot of people misund",1
"Title: Elegant but superficial Bach
Review: There are always two kinds of pianists in this world. The ones, prodigiously talented, praised by critics and satisfied with themselves, never question what they are doing, therefore stuck in one place without ever reaching depth of music making which can stand test of time. (Kissin, Ashkenazy, Argerich etc)<br /><br />The others who keep asking questions and aspire to reach higher realm of music making, trying to capture fleeting moment of the divine. (Richter, Rubinstein, Pogorelich, Volodos etc)<br /><br />To me Hewitt belongs to the former. The elegance, fluency and subtlety of her playing are admirable enough, but that's all there is. Her recordings and her live performances Bach give me the impression that she is just content scratchi",0

Review: Love this shaker cup!<br />I’m not a big fan of putting a lot of liquid in my pre and post workout drinks, and this has 8 ounces on each side; roughly the same size as the mini normal shakers.<br />The little grates at the top work well for mixing up the light products I use, but I can see where some people have issues with their protein powder. One thing I might recommend is giving a little ball or something that can be placed within each side to shake up thicker things like that.<br />Overall, love it and would purchase again!",1
"Title: Not only didn't work, but disabled the speakers on two systems.
Review: This device did not work with any Windows 8 system I tested it on. Not only that, it would somehow prevent the on-board speakers from working at all. I would consider myself a power user and have even done some systems programming, not that it is entirely relevant to this review, but every so often I read a review and wonder if it was something that was more of a user error. Well, maybe it was a user error in this case, but if so it was subtle enough that I wasn't able to fix it.<br /><br />Perhaps this is just a windows 8 problem, but I tested this on two different laptops with the same result.<br /><br />I had to pay to have this shipped back, so in summary it was a waste of hope, time, money, and effort.",0

Review: With all the positive reviews, I was really excited to receive this bike. It was easy to assemble, but does not work for me. It seems that no matter the height of the chair, I can’t get this at a height that is comfortable to pedal. It rocks side to side and slides across the floor. It does come with a strap that you can attach to the chair, but that doesn’t stop the rocking back and forth. There isn’t enough resistance nor enough space for your feet to clear the ground without concentrating on it. There’s no way this will work under my desk or anywhere else in my house. Unfortunately, I’ll be sending it back.",0

Review: I bought two of these products for my two adult kids who are now in their own places. One worked a bit and then stopped showing images (and we have several other brand of digital images which work just fine). The other one didn't even turn on out of the box. Toshiba's customer service was terrible. I had documented that they were less than 6 months old and Toshiba refused the replacement of the one that works a bit but doesn't correctly show images. For the other one that doesn't even power on, Toshiba offered me a White digital frame in replacement for my Black one. I cannot use the white frame anywhere and bought a black one for a reason.<br /><br />Jamie at Toshiba threw their hands up and refused to help me any further, saying that was ",0
"Title: Don't waste your money
Review: I really don't get this product.  It is meant to be a combination moisturizing treatment and purple conditioner, meant to reduce brassy tones in blonde hair.  I've used about half the bottle, and it doesn't really seem to do much of anything that it is supposed to.  First of all, on the moisturizing- it's meant to be an extra-conditioning treatment.  It's supposed to be more moisturizing than an actual conditioner.  However, the consistency of this stuff is basically water.  It goes on the hair as water, and has about as much effect as water.  In other words, it did no conditioning of my hair.  Secondly, the packaging is terrible.  This treatment comes in a spray bottle, but the spray is really hard to work- it takes some amount of force to",0
"Title: Disappointing
Review: I ordered this swimsuit using amazon prime, so it arrived very quickly. However when I opened the box I noticed that the plastic bags it was in was ripped open and the other bag was unzipped, so the bottoms to the swimsuit were spilling out. Not too big of a deal since I planned to wash it anyways, but once I took the bottoms out I realized the top was missing. I checked the recipe and posting again to make sure it said set and not just bottoms and it clearly states set. Also, after reading the reviews stating that it ran small I ordered a medium; way to big! The back is also very very cheeky! I'm 5'2 and 125 lbs just in case someone needs a references for themselves. Sadly I will just be returning the suit (bottoms) and looking for somethi",0
"Title: Disappointing
Review: This was a shame! I may have liked it if it didn’t have a label on it when it arrived that it has cancer causing materials in it’s construction and they can cause birth defects. No one wants to sit on that situation. I thought they were a “Green Company” to make matters worse two of the legs had no receiving screw catches to screw the legs into and you do need four legs on this piece. When I packed it up to send back I could hear parts rolling around inside the piece they were supposed to be in. It was not easy to put together but we did all the work to have the final part be defective. I took it apart and packed more carefully than they did and since the label said you ship had to pay $324.00 to ship it back. BIG Mistake and for their defe",0

Review: Save your money! Don't buy this! I had read the reviews and decided to take a chance. Well? I shouldn't have! The negative reviews were dead on. The pipe arrived today and it was a disappointment from the start. The pieces don't fit or stay together. The porcelain bowl loosely sits and falls out. Forget about the stem! I tried wedging it in as tight as I could and it still would not hold. I managed to get one smoke but spending so much time holding it just right ruined any imagined joy I thought I was going to have.<br /><br />Not Amazon's fault but the manufacturer's shoddy work.

Review: Gave it 5 stars because I've not found a reason to give it less.  I've used McAfee for years.  I especially like the Quick Clean feature that cleans up my computer's unnecessary temporary files along with clearing the cache and history and other things that take up space and can slow down a computer.<br /><br />I was hesitant this time when I bought it though, because it was for a download with a subscription code card number.

"Title: Horrible ending
Review: This book definitely needed both grammar and spelling editing. However, that is not what I disliked most about this book. There was not one single character who was likeable!! Everyone got what they deserved, it was a horrible ending. Throughout the book I kept wanting the main character to have one shred of decency so I could care about what happened to him, but he was and remained a sad, pathetic, selfish person and I didn't care a whit about what happened to him. Stop reading if you don't want a spoiler alert but even the person who ended up with the time machine at the end of the book was a horrible person. This book was an exercise in and account of the lives of horrible people, a waste of time. It was too bad too, because the writing ",0

"Title: I can't wait to use this this summer!
Review: I haven't used this in my car yet, but I've fooled with it in my house a little.  I like that it folds up to a pretty small size; about the diameter of a dinner plate, but unfolds into two rectangular panels to place into your windshield.  At first, I was a little put off by the fact the sun shade is made up of two separate panels, but it makes sense to construct it that way so that it can fit multiple cars!  I can see taking this out of my car (a wider sports coupe) and throwing it into my wife's &#34;cute ute&#34; which has a narrower windshield.  The sunshade is a silver color that I hope reflects the suns heat away.  And it also comes with a handy storage pouch to tuck the sunshade away in once it's folded down into its dinner plate sto",1

Once he is done putting together the item he will often make his own creations.<br /><br />I love the quality of the LEGOs. I don’t think we have ever had one break and we have many, many sets.

Not sure on long term use, but my short term, just setup experience was so poor, I can't imagine continuing to use the product.  Why are the included instructions so limited. They omit what can be vital information and recommend a questions website that doesn't provide documentation, but only contact info.

I'm nearing my 40's and I need to start worrying about winkles... well I should started sooner but.....<br /> I've been using this for about two months and really really like it. It's thick, creamy, and just a little bit does wonders for your skin.<br />There's a slight smell but I feel like it fades fast. I've used other products where I felt like a stinky old lady after but I don't with this.<br />My skin has had no dryness, no breakouts, and has a nice glow. I wish the price was a bit lower BUT even th",1
"Title: This is not a reliable product.
Review: Mine looked great in the packaging for the price.  While setting it up as a hard wired access point however I was in the process of connecting devices to it and after the 3rd device the thing stopped working and needed to be unplugged.  I should have taken that as a sign because the thing hasn't run more than 3 hours without having this issue.  The SSID will still show up, but if you try to connect to it windows will say &#34;this is taking longer than usual&#34; and eventually connect.  Once connected the internet doesnt work anymore, connecting within the network doesn't work anymore.. and you cant even access the AP backend until you shut the AP off and turn it back on.

"Title: Not what I was expecting
Review: I purchased this thinking it was the original sized Jenga without obviously reading everything or even looking at the title in detail. I just was excited to have my own Jenga. Anyway, when I received it, the entire packaging fit into my palm. I was disappointed and returned it without even opening it up.<br /><br />I guess I should have known it was a mini version when the price was less than $5.00 but I also have no idea what the price of a normal-sized Jenga would be.<br /><br />Read everything before you press that “BUY” button!",0
"Title: Does not work - diffuser keeps slipping out of adapter
Review: I purchased this adapter to use with an Xtava Black Orchid Hair Diffuser - for Blow Dryers with 1.8 inch Diameter Nozzle.  It was displayed on the same Amazon page as the diffuser, and the diffuser came with instructions for how to use this adapter.  So, I assume that they were made to work with each other.<br /><br />This adapter is just a short cylinder of flexible rubber.  It does allow me to connect the diffuser to the hairdryer.  But, when using the hairdryer/diffuser, the diffuser keeps falling off.<br /><br />Therefore, this adapter is not functional at all.  Beware!",0
"Title: Not Much Consistancy...this time returned
Review: I have purchased this item over 10 different times, and those of you who have noticed it is not as thick are not just seeing things.  I use this fabric for hand dyeing as it takes dye quite well after being washed with textile detergent to remove any sizing.  I think the problem here is that it doesn't always come from the same seller.  If you look, you don't see the seller named.  This is fulfilled by Amazon so my guess is they are using different places to get the fabric.  I have received cloth in the past that was as thin as muslin and some that was much thicker.  I just placed a new order and will see.  One of the sellers (Hancock Fabric in KY seems to be the best).  Their name was on the shipping label.  That is the only reason I knew ",0
"Title: Ready for the reefs!
Review: I've always wanted one of these things. I wish I had it when I was in Puerto Rico for six months! When I saw that this one has an attachment for my action camera, I was convinced.<br /><br />My only hesitation was that I am 6'6"" tall, have a very large head (as compared to the 5'8"" national average) and this mask might not have fit correctly. It DOES. Just barely. But, it does.<br /><br />I took the mask with me, when I was giving my wife some swimming instruction at the community pool. Here's what l like.<br /><br />First, the silicone gaskets that fit around my face form a perfect seal. It actually creates two compartments. The one for my nose and mouth are have the very cool ventilation system built in.  Inhalations come in through one w",1
"Title: Great jacket
Review: This is a very nice outdoor jacket by First Stop.<br /><br />This is a very nice jacket. It is soft and very comfortable. It is flattering on. The fit is very good.<br /><br />We were pleased with the durability of this jacket. The quality seemed very good. It seems like it will last a long time.<br /><br />Because of the neutral colors this is pretty versatile. It will go with most things. It is very attractive.<br /><br />It provides a good amount of warmth. It isn't too thin or too thick - it is a good medium jacket.<br /><br />I would recommend it.",1
"Title: Strands not microfiber, but plastic which fall out. RETURNS NOT ALLOWED. Got a refund.
Review: I am very disappointed with these. They are advertised as microfiber, but the dusting “heads” are made out of plastic very similar to the old plastic grass used in Easter baskets, only thinner. I’d accept that if they worked, but they did not. For example, I used one to dust the top edge of a 2” thin wall display case. Then I ran my finger over the same area and my finger was full of dust. The plastic strands arrived bent which would normally be okay if they were actually a fiber, but being plastic, there was no way to fix the bent strands.<br /><br />When I washed one by gently swishing it around in a sink filled with water, several strands fell out. Twirling it gently to remove the dripping water caused more strands to fall out. I expecte",0
"Title: white faux fur
Review: Used as &#34;santa&#34; trim on a costume I was making.  Washed and dried before using.... did beautifully.  It is very, very soft and looks rich - not cheapy like some of the other straight poly blend faux furs... I think cause it's so soft and NOT &#34;shiny&#34; like some of those fauxs can be.  It IS fuzzy... so where it's cut, there is a lot of excess fuzz... but it eventually calms down. I bought WAY more than I needed... so I will have to figure out what to do with the rest of it.  Gladly.",1
"Title: SCHWINN 430 ELLIPTICAL
Review: I just bought this Schwinn 430 Elliptical and I have not put 1hr of ""USE"" on this machine and it is making this ""extremely loud noise"".<br />It sounds like it wants to break down. I will see what the customer service at schwinn says about the noise and fix.<br />It will probably go back to Amazon. I don't want to spend $600 to a machine that sounds like it is about to break within having it for 6 days.<br />It seemed like a good machine some the reviews I read. Maybe I got a lemon. Will update about the fix and then I will change my rating.",0
"Title: Water tank is a toy, not a model.
Review: This is a toy, not an item for any serious modeler.  (I did not realize that it was really &#34;Plasticville&#34;, which is now owned by Bachmann.  Had I known I would never have bought it.  I remember Plasticville as a producer of cheap plastic structures for toy trains in the 1960's.  Nothing has changed.<br />The tank itself has obvious, poorly glued seams on both sides.  The spout and structural members underneath are loaded with flash and poorly trimmed sprues.  The spout (also loaded with flash) is connected to the counterweights with stiff black thread that is simply knotted in place with the ends hanging out.<br />The company's return policy is for you to pay the shipping both ways.  That comes to over eight dollars on a sixteen dol",0
"Title: As advertised, good pan
Review: I purchased this pan to use as a litter pan for my cats.  I was concerned over the dimensions of the pan; it's longer but narrower than my other litter pan.  When I transitioned to this litter pan, I still had the other pan available for the cats to use.  They slowly took to it.  I am glad I purchased this and I even bought another so that I have a spare while I'm washing the soiled one.  Like other users (regardless if they were using this pan for food or other) I did notice that the finish on this pan has a tendency to &#34;stain&#34; or &#34;varnish&#34;?  I'm not sure exactly what to call it but even cleaning this with soap by hand, some of the finish seems to get discolored so that when it's clean and dry, you can still see &#34;spots&",1
"Title: Great for sensitive skin
Review: This is the only sunscreen my sensitive baby can tolerate. Of course I want to protect her from the sun’s rays and this works great. She’s never had a sunburn while using this product. My only slight con is that is a little difficult to rub in completely to the skin. There always seems to be some white streaking from the sunscreen. It doesn’t help that my baby will turn away when trying to apply anything on her including sunscreen. We will definitely continue to use this product because it really works so well.",1
"Title: Just what I needed!
Review: I’m using this to seal paintings on ceramic, stone, and wood surfaces. That fact that is non-yellowing is extremely important, because it doesn’t change the look of the paintings. The finish is durable too!<br /><br />With the cold weather upon us, make sure that you are completing the sealing process in a warm, low humidity environment. This is how you will get the best results. Oh, and just because it’s low odor does not mean that you shouldn’t have proper ventilation! Work safe!<br />Would recommend.",1
"Title: Love this float!
Review: Our two year old granddaughter was terrified of letting us go while in the water, even with a different brand life vest on. We expected this camping trip to be the same as others, with her climbing us like trees when we took her to the pool, but it wasn't! After only thirty minutes of sitting on the step, and floating in the kiddie pool, she got into the big pool, and walked into the water unafraid!! Within an hour she was actually moving herself in the water! She was terrified of other floats. Now she is starting to swim. We are so happy with this product! My only complaint would be that the arms seem to loosen as the day goes on, but that would probably happen with any float.",1
"Title: What age is this for?!
Review: Most of this book is the kind of picture book you would read to a toddler, showing &#34;things that fly&#34;.  A picture (stock nature photo), with the facing page showing the name of the animal or object - &#34;Bee&#34;, &#34;Airplane,&#34; &#34;Ladybug,&#34; etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are also a couple of pages with relatively detailed information given.  It seems wildly inconsistent, making it tough to know what age group might be best served by this book.<br /><br />The &#34;size&#34; of the book is also filled out with &#34;note taking&#34; pages, with titles like, &#34;List other animals you know that have wings&#34;. Exactly how the child is supposed to write them down on a Kindle screen I don't know, and it doesn't make an",0
"Title: Best rasp I’ve ever found!
Review: I had a few minutes to try this out, right after it was delivered. It literally took about 3 minutes to make some really awful callouses on my heels disappear. I’ve used several different types over the years, and they’re small, too fine, too coarse, or the handle breaks the first time I use it.<br /><br />Not this one. It covers a lot of real estate, seems good and sharp without cutting me, and made my heels look 30 years younger.<br /><br />One very minor issue is that there’s no cover to catch the filings, so you’ll want to put down a paper towel or something so you don’t make a mess.<br /><br />I haven’t tried the pumice stones yet, but I’m very impressed with the rasp.",1
"Title: Poorly written and very dull
Review: Author Lois Duncan’s daughter Kait Arquette was murdered. There is no question the Albuquerque police botched the investigation. But Who Killed My Daughter? is basically a poorly written concoction of what the family assumes happened, mainly because of multiple psychics they consulted. Most of the psychic transcripts included are so vague that it’s kind of funny that they decided the psychics meant certain things because what was said could have meant virtually anything. I’ve read a lot of true crime and this was the dullest I’ve ever read. While the author stated her purpose was to encourage someone who knew what led to Kait’s murder (which is still unsolved today) to come forward, it felt more like a mother wanting to tell the story that ",0
"Title: Each are great!
Review: The quality and feel of these are great! The colors are so pretty. They actually look almost the exact same in color but they have different textures so that alters the shade a bit. The high shine is more shiny and slightly more of translucent gloss but is buildable. The velvet doesn't take as much to appear darker. They really both are very similar in shade and both match with the liner really well. They're also very comfortable to wear- not sticky or heavy feeling. All 3 live up to the longwear in the product details. With the liner it does help prevent feathering. I love each item and the shades. I rate each item in the 5-stars.",1
"Title: Perfect for keeping your tires properly inflated.
Review: This item is just what I wanted. It’s compact in a nice bag. It is easy to use, although I thought the instructions were poor. Still, it was helpful enough to get me started. I used it to inflate all four tires. I set it to inflate to 34 psi. The first two inflated to 34 psi then stopped automatically. The other two inflated to 32.5 and cut off automatically. So not perfectly accurate every time. However, when I used my manual gauge, it said 40 psi.  So I recommend double checking with your manual gauge for accuracy.  Make sure when setting your shut off psi that your digital readout says PSI. The instructions were not clear on this. I am happy with this purchase.",1
"Title: Excellent quality case with both form and function
Review: I’m very impressed with this case. It’s understated in how it looks – just a simple, black leather case. The leather is of good quality with a soft feel and a nice grain texture. The stitching around the edges is tight and even. Zero complaints about the overall durability and construction quality.<br /><br />The inside has a plastic case to hold the phone. It’s also black to blend in with the leather, and is padded on the inside (the part that touches the phone) so it won’t cause any scratches. The phone holder is firmly attached to the case, and is not removable as listed in the product description. The holder is properly sized for the phone for a tight fit, but without blocking ports.<br /><br />On the opposite side of the phone holder t",1
"Title: Fashion and function is what you get with this rope leash
Review: ★ i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I was not influenced by anyone in any way.<br /><br />This reflective rope leash is sturdy and safe with reflective material built into the durable rope material so you and your dog shine bright even at night. Soft grip will help you keep a comfortable handle on your pet. I like that it has a little stretching and the swivel spring snap that easy opens to hook but keeps closed while in use.<br /><br />There are several colors to choose from, and will most likely have your favorite color. I got the purple one for my dog. She's little about 8 pounds so this leash is a little large for her. I am going to put this leash in a donation raffle basket I'm making for the loca",1

Review: The product description claim this part is compatible with 08790-2H000A air filter. But actually it is bigger than the original Hyundai 08790-2H000A air filter. It's too big to be installed to my 2013 Hyundai Elantra. I want to return it, but the shipping cost is virtually same as the price of the filter already.

"Title: An excellent Bluetooth mouse for under $25.00
Review: Smooth and quiet. The scroll works well and tracking is great. This mouse is much better than the Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500.<br /><br />I'm using Windows 10 and I simply followed the directions on the box it the mouse paired easily. Microsoft includes a Duracell battery instead of some &#34;knock off&#34; brand so that's a plus.<br /><br />The battery door is easy to open (very nice touch).<br /><br />Being Bluetooth, no transceiver is needed for Bluetooth enabled computers.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an excellent Bluetooth mouse for under $25.00.",1

Review: Terrible battery. The battery came in a padded envelope with a thick pad around it, but the blue harness around the battery was still broken. I charge the battery before use and it lasted for maybe an hour and we had to charge it again. After the second charging it stopped holding a charge and won’t work anymore.

"Title: Perfectly Petite
Review: How did I wear earrings before all these flat-backed options? I am completely spoiled.<br /><br />These are perfectly petite posts - I got the silver hearts. They came with THREE back options - a traditional screw-on, a completely flat screw-on disc, and a clear soft plastic option. They are so petite that at first I had a hard time with my stubby fingers, but I was able to secure the flat back (my option).<br /><br />These are fantastic! They would also make a good gift - they came in a small ""vegan leather"" (read: PVC) pouch with and alcohol prep as well.",1

Review: I wasn’t able to get a video of the assembly or my 1 year old nephew LOVING it because my phone died. However the presentation as a gift is exactly what I expected based of the description from the seller. The quality is also spot on I was so happy his parents also loved the natural wood, sturdiness and design. It’s a safer option than plastic toys. Assembled in 5-10 minutes!! It’s on the pricier side but I recommend it still. Plastic is not safe and I just know my nephew is at a stage to put everything in his mouth lol",1
"Title: horrible dishwasher from Bosch
Review: We got this dishwasher as a ""gift"" about 18 months ago. I was thrilled to have a Bosch dishwasher and thought this was a great update to our previous lesser-known brand dishwasher. Boy was I wrong. This dishwasher has given us nothing but problems that no one is able to properly diagnose, meaning we have already spent double the purchase price in repairs and it's still not working properly! I would definitely advise folks to steer clear of this dishwasher and I personally will not try a Bosch dishwasher again since the internet is filled with other bad experience stories about other Bosch dishwashers.",0

"Title: No lip plumping action. Blistex
Review: I’m very disappointed in this product. This is advertised as a lip plumper. This is simply lip balm. Think Blistex it’s very similar in texture and moisture and has a Little bit of a cooling feel. Remember Blistex that was all the rage in junior high 30 years ago. That’s essentially what this product is. Your lips will be soft and protected from chapping but they will not be plump. This tube of lip moisturizer has an applicant with silver round balls. The bars don’t roll or enhance application at all but they do make the product look professional. You cannot wear lipstick over this product it’s too slippery. Given that it doesn’t plump or have any cosmetic affect at all if you do purchase this simply stick to using it as a nighttime moistur",0

Review: Arrived as described.  These were a heavier gauge than the factory Toyota hog rings I was removing, but they were still easy to use with a proper set of hog ring pliers.  The quantity in the package was plenty for my project.  In fact, I could do 3 similar projects.  Your needs will vary depending on the way your vehicles seats are built, but this package will almost certainly be enough for a typical auto upholstery project.  I would definitely buy these again if I had another automotive upholstery project.",1

The second valve actually is working after considerable gerrymandering on my part and no instructions.

I am VERY disappointed that Amazon would send out used parts that weren't even tested. Another family member had a similar experience with something recently ordered.",0
"Title: Never Again
Review: I'm shocked at how a trimmer that price ranges from $30-$44 can be so awful. It doesn't trim. It hardly does even a light shave let alone a close one. The only plus side is that it doesn't hurt, cut, or irritate, but that is also a red flag on how useless this thing is: it just doesn't work. The blade is so dull, all the shaving heads are ineffective, heck even the charger doesn't even work right. What ever happened to the models from years ago where sure, maybe the shaver would nick, but hey, it actually gave a close shave, and it didn't cost as much then as it does now? That very same model, I still own, and it still works! I only bought this one because I figured that maybe it's due time to get a new shaver, but alas, I returned this bec",0
"Title: Quality “Book” Boxes Work for Stacking, Shelf Storage
Review: Moving goes much, much faster when you pack everything in uniform-sized moving boxes.  If you’re paying movers by the hour, the savings can really add up.  If you’re moving your stuff yourself, you’ll find it much easier to pack your car, truck, or van when your boxes are all the same size and shape.<br /><br />These CARDBOARD MOVING BOXES (Medium Size - 16 x 12 x 12 inch Packing Boxes - 25 Boxes Per Pack) are good quality “book” boxes.  Because books are heavy--especially hardcover books--you want relatively small boxes for books.  The size of the box itself limits the contents to a weight that a strong man or woman can lift.<br /><br />Even if you aren’t packing books, these medium-sized boxes are an extremely useful size.

Review: I received these as free review samples. When I accepted an offer to review them I was ambivalent, but am totally impressed with them not.<br /><br />As a test I used one on a dinner plate with a raised edge and true to the product description it totally sealed it. I was actually able to lift the plate, which was a surprise. For me the biggest use is as a cover of bowls and soup cups when I am heating up a leftover in the microwave. I typically use Saran wrap, but these work perfectly and I am estimating that I will save at least twenty bucks a year since Saran wrap is expensive and lesser brands are not as clingy.<br /><br />These are also excellent for covering and sealing leftovers in their original pots and pans in the fridge.

Review: It's hard for me to review the actual quality of the air this machine spits out because my house doen't have a cat or anything like that.  However, the air smells clean, and on quiet mode it makes virtually no noise.  The machine is big, but I suppose it has to be, and it is no larger than another similar unit I already owned.  My one complaint is something that many people might like so I didn't take off any stars:  There is an animated design on the control panel that doesn't stop, which distracts me and gets annoying after a while.",1

Review: I recently purchased this bottle jack and have been extremely impressed with its performance. The jack is designed to lift heavy loads with ease and has a wide range of uses.<br /><br />The jack is made of high-quality materials and feels very sturdy and durable. One of the best things about this jack is that it has a lifting capacity of up to 4 tons, which means it can handle some heavy loads. I have used it for a variety of tasks such as lifting my car to rotate tires, lifting heavy equipment in my workshop, and even lifting a fence post out of the ground. The jack also has a compact and portable design which makes it easy to move around.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this bottle jack to anyone looking for a powerful, durable, an",1
"Title: Great for Two Chihuahuas in the Car
Review: My little Chihuahuas ride quite well, but I had hoped to have them ride a little more securely. They have a large plastic pet taxi type carrier, but it's really large, has hard sides and I have trouble strapping it into a seat belt. There are no regulating bodies or standards for seat-belts for your pets, so I've been looking for the past few months for something that would be better than our current situation. My dogs are four and five pounds, so they can share most carriers. My cat is about ten pounds, so he would fit okay for short trips if needed. I like the luggage strap on the back. I've belted this into the seat-belt, and it's as good as I can do to keep them safe. Before, their plastic carrier may have bounced all over in an acciden",1

Review: I loved this. I have a 4 year old with Down syndrome who is way too sneaky and fast for his own good. I liked that I could just walk along and hold his hand with this, but if he slipped out of my grip he couldn't actually run off.<br />Much better than the typical leash style kid harnesses on the market. I didn't feel like I'm walking my child. Sadly about the 3rd time we used it he got mad about it and pulled so hard his wrist piece tore off of the chord dropping him into gravel. Not fun. He is 35lbs. Not a large 4 year old by any means. It should have been able to hold him and the reinforcing wire running the length of the chord gives you the impression that it is strong.

Easy install, just turn OFF the water supply for the ice maker in the basement first. Snip the plastic tubing close to original.

"Title: Brilliant Concept
Review: Robert Adler's book is truly an engaging read. Once I started reading it was a true journey through time and I could hardly wait to find out what ""Science First"" had occurred next. Robert Adler highlights the sudden brilliance of a select number of scientists, which actually seems to be a result of serious study and contemplation.<br /><br />You can literally see how ideas evolved through time and how each scientist discovered inner genius despite immense discouragement and conflict, not to mention religious persecution and their own human foibles. You can see how humans started to observe the exterior surroundings and then started to delve into the areas of cell structure and the invisible atom.<br /><br />This book presents scientists in ",1
"Title: Run away from this film!
Review: Someone whose only qualification for making a documentary on the great Halston is the fact that they love anything that has to do with th 70s should not have made this film. He knows NOTHING about design so can't ask the right (or any) questions to people that you will be shocked to see. I don't know how he got in the same room with these stars to do pointless conversations where he ask nothing because he doesn't know what he is doing. I'm not sure he realizes the opportunity he had to make a brilliant documentary on an amazing designer. His only reason for making this film in the first place is that he loves the 70s (though to him, someone who wasn't around at the time, the 70s seem to just consist of Burt Reynolds and Smokey And The Bandi",0
"Title: Lifetime, Seriously?!
Review: This is easily one of the most unnecessary shows on television. Sure, there are shows dedicated to women bickering and fighting, but introducing the same concept to some random people (how did you find these people, Lifetime?), is a horrible concept. After watching 2 episodes (I tried), it's clear it's made to show that self proclaimed &#34;affluent&#34; (questionable) Blacks act just as low class as stereotypical (bka &#34;urban counterparts&#34; government cheese eating, food stamp having, gold chain wearing- according to leading cast member, Anisha Morell) Blacks. There is an opportunity being missed here, in showcasing how these people became or are continuing their financial success. 2 episodes in, alI I know is that one is a lawyer an",0
"Title: Great Bike Rack For Price
Review: Love this Allen hitch bike rack.  Have used 5 times and bikes are safe, secure, and no wobbling.  Directions not the greatest with securing the lock to hitch - but I was able to lock it tightly.  Since it would be a pain to take it off/on constantly, leaving it on car for the midwest bike season.  The hitch rack lowering to open hatch is a breeze.  Glad I bought the locking hitch.<br /><br />The black pads that hold the bikes is adequate although I've seen other Allen bike racks with red pads that seem higher quality- not a deal breaker.  If bikes are put on just right, it will hold 4 bikes.",1

I needed to wash some things and I like to live on the cheap and I was hoping this thing was going to work for me than break and be a broken expense, with some of the reviews I read this thing was gonna break on me in a month of using it casually or a little longer, but when I got it I noticed it had very thick plastic, very durable plastic.

"Title: Truly, a terrible, horrible book
Review: I'm a big fan of urban fantasy and paranormal fiction, but comparing this book with Ilona Andrews or Patricia Briggs is like comparing Bouef Wellington to a McDonald's hamburger.  Sure, they're both meat, but one feeds your soul while the other just fills you with junk and artificial ingredients, and makes you fat.<br /><br />This is an awful book. The plot is ridiculous and merely a skeleton that was never fleshed out.  The characters are unbelievable, the dialogue is annoying and gave me headache from the number of eye rolls I gave in the first chapter alone.  I don't know what the author was attempting, but the pseudo-southern dialect sounded like nothing I've ever heard from a real person.<br /><br />I get that a lot of people think the",0
"Title: Good quality, and lots of cups!
Review: The cups and lids are sold separately, so if you need both be sure to order both.<br /><br />The 3.25 ounce cups are perfect for many uses. We use them for dipping sauces so that we can each have our own cup of sauce and we don't dirty a bunch of oversize cups and bowls. They are the perfect size for dipping fries, chicken tenders, vegetables and other foods. There is no problem fitting the food into the cup for dipping.<br /><br />I also use them to mix acrylic paints. I can mix a small batch of paint without spilling it when I stir. They are also handy for holding small parts, such as beads and findings when making jewelry.<br /><br />The cups are sturdy and I'm sure we are going to come up with lots of other uses for them, beyond the obv",1

Review: Obtaining an hourglass figure takes hard work and dedication. I've been waist training for over a year and recently needed to replace my old worn out shaper.  This one is similar to my previous one so I decided to order.<br /><br />I ordered a large and should have gotten medium however I am still able to use it. The sizes do run a little small and I overcompensated on my order.<br /><br />This shaper is very comfortable,the inside is lined with a soft almost fleece like lined inside. The outside is a rubber latex feel. The shaper does not pinch or into your skin. I wear mine from the time I wake up until bed with no problems. It provided great support to the lumbar region and as someone who suffers from back pain that is a huge plus.<br />",1
"Title: Something I'd Been Waiting For.
Review: I'm a great collector of Christmas music, preferring the traditional and nostalgic.  For many years one could only get the same few songs from before 1950.  This two disc collection is pretty generous and includes rarities like the Nat King Cole Trio's 'Jingle Bells' and lots of big band novelties.  I'd also recommend the ASV/Living Era largely British Christmas discs, if you can still find them. The original Capitol Records Christmas on the Range has old country stuff that's great, and I love Blue Christmas (also out of print?)with Johnny Otis,  Sugar Chile Robinson, and several jump blues greats. one can have a lot of fun without burning out on Bing Crosby or the tasteless Mariah Carey, though I commend her...volume.<br /><br />Anyway, th",1
"Title: Wasn't safe for my cat
Review: This is the third day my cat has been unable to eat or drink. He's tremendously distressed. Seamus, the manufacturer, has issued a refund, but no amount of money will make this okay. I applied the medicated pad to his front forelegs after a minor injury, and I held on to him, wrapped in a towel, for as long as I could to allow drying time. He squirmed away, but I thought the time had been sufficient; I was wrong. He's suffering. I'm suffering for him, and I don't think the disclaimers are sufficient. I would not recommended this product for cats unless the injury could be wrapped or a cone used. In my case, the product was unsafe to use.",0
"Title: Isn't durable enough
Review: I have owned two of these stands, and I have been fairly disappointed with the results. The first one I owned worked well until one of the legs got stepped on by someone and the flute would simply fall over if placed on it. So I purchased another, but again one of the legs bent (this time simply by extended use instead of an accident) and though the flute still stands upright on it, it leans significantly to one side all the time, which is a pretty big concern.<br /><br />Simply put, the legs are just too flimsy to be durable to last and safely protect your flute. The ability to store the stand in the footjoint isn't a good enough perk for me to continue using these stands.<br /><br />If you plan on getting a stand that you will use a lot I",0
"Title: No online servers anymore
Review: My little nephew is 6yo and loves Star Wars and lives out of state.  I bought two of these so we could play together online in the co-op mode as described in the description.  Unfortunately there are no more servers for this game to be able to play online co-op mode.<br /><br />My nephew loves the game, but I gave it one star because it does not do the one feature that I purchased this game for, which was to play with him online.  Otherwise I could care less about this game, and it just sits on my shelf.<br /><br />If you are planning on buying this game for the single player, or two player on one console mode, than you will probably be happy.  Just be aware that there is no longer an online co-op gameplay mode.",0

Review: I am a bit of a crochet junkie and I have several different hook sets, aluminum, aluminum with bamboo handles, bamboo, rosewood, beech wood, and these aluminum hooks with the soft touch handles. I use all of the hooks that I have depending on what type of project I am working on. (I do love them all!) But these feel very light in the hand, very nice grip without causing the hand to feel tired. Nice short shaft which aids in the conformity of stitches. Works wonderful if you like a tighter stitch or if you are working with fine yarn or thread. I also use these hooks with a medium wt and chunky wt. yarns and have had great results.",1

Hung up the belt overnight to let it air out. (Stupid me! Way too forgiving of a defective product). Next day: still stanky. If the mold spores have penetrated our living space thanks to Amazon 3rd rate China suppliers - well I learned my lesson. Best buy things you need to smell in person. Not online. Lest inferior and obviously defective merchandise show up at your door. Doubtless, the seller vends the moldy stuff on Amazon (where there is no Smell Control) and sends the sweet leather smelling inventory to Macy's. So now I know. So do you.",0

After doing so I was still having no luck. So I order 2 more wands and attached them and same still was sticking on.

"Title: Save Your Money!
Review: One would think from the description that this item is a breakthrought in pill crushing and would do a much better job than a five-dollar pill crusher at the local drugstore.<br /><br />However that is not the case.  This $112 item is basically an over-priced grinder and I had to use it five times just to even come close to being equal with using my $8 pill crusher just one time!  In addition, there is no pill cutter on it.<br /><br />Furthermore, the manufacturer wants to ""milk"" people by having them tied into buying their little plastic pouches--which are very expensive.  In fact, the manufacturer will even void the warranty if you do not buy their over-priced plastic bags.<br /><br />Finally, the merchant, US Medical, delayed in allowing",0

It IS a great solution, it makes tons of ice and the noise stopped (or we got used to it) and it’s wonderful.<br /><br />We purchased this water cooler, after frustration with our fridges ice maker.  At around the same time, out water cooler stopped working, so this seemed a great solution:<br /><br />First the good:  it makes ice and cools water quickly.

"Title: Wow, Great Product
Review: I recently adopted a beautiful 80-pound shepherd/collie blend, and she has turned out to be an absolute monster shedder. So I decided to stock up here on a variety of brushes.<br /><br />This product was over twice as expensive as the others I bought, and I have to say that it is worth every penny. I'm going to buy at least one more as soon as I hit submit on this review, so that we can double up and reduce time spent brushing our newest family member.<br /><br />Build quality is sturdy and excellent. I think this will last for a long time. Functionally, it's a brush -- of course -- but it's a very well designed one. The handle is comfortable and most importantly this brush picks up an impressively large amount of fur on each pass. Cleanup ",1
"Title: Deep pore cleansing.
Review: Hydriance transition cleanser is full of skin friendly ingredients like other products in this line. I like to rotate my cleansers. Usually use a heavy duty cleanser at night to wash away makeup and dirt and light one in the morning. This cleanser takes away all traces of makeup and dirt and cleans your pores s well.  I wear waterproof mascara and usually have to take it off before washing my face, but with this cleanser I just wet my face, take a small amount of cleanser and apply to my face. Gently rub my lashes and the mascara comes off easily. It is big plus for me since sometimes I forget to take off mascara and when I wash my face with other cleanser, I end up with raccoon eyes. You don’t need a lot of this cleanser so the bottle is g",1

The Rift S, however ... has been the worst product experience I can remember. The first unit I got was defective, and would hang at the ""sensor check"" on setup ...

Review: We purchased this cable in March of this year (2011).  It worked for about 4 months.  Now we get no sound out of the mic.  If you jiggle the connection at the keyboard, you can get a slight intermittent sound.  I know it's the cable because I tried a different microphone and cable.  I got both of our mics to work on a different cable.

This smells good!<br /><br />The gel cream is made for body, but can also be used as a face wash as well as a hand wash. It rinses well, has a nice scent, but doesn't cling as much as the bars of soap do. Doesn't leave skin feeling parched. Just clean.

I tried to wear one of the camis, but I had to keep pulling it into place, because my bra would show.  That never happened with the older, original product.

This is a smaller waterbottle than we are used to, but it still holds enough for a day at summer camp with few refills.  The top is a plug, not a screw on.  Initially I was against that becauase of potential leakage, but it is tight enough and the rubber is supple enough to make a good seal. But I would still feel a little better with a catch or a thread to hold the top on.<br /><br />All in all this is a great bottle with elegant looks that makes it stand out from the summer camp crowd.  We'll see how long she can keep track of it.",1
"Title: Most People Have Heard a Few of Their Singles from this Album
Review: If you have to ask who the BoDeans are, you didn't listen to the radio much in the late 80s and early 90s.  They had a lot of airplay.  I'll preface this review by saying this: I DON'T buy many concert tickets.  I figure for the price of one LOUSY seat at a concert I can get the BEST CD available.  I took that to task with the BoDeans.  I WANTED to see them live and I did.  And BOY was I glad.<br /><br />Black & White offers some really good music.  Most people have heard at least a couple of songs from this disc alone.  Paradise, Naked and Going Home received a fair amount of airplay.  One of my favorites, the third cut, Black, White and Blood Red is a haunting, haunting thing - even moreso live.<br /><br />When I listen to this disc from ",1
"Title: A Wonder Drug for Pools!
Review: I have a 24k lined pool. Even with heavy rain within the past couple of weeks, I had noticed that the level was getting close to the bottom of the skimmer inlet. I filled it Sunday morning and by Wed afternoon it was back down. A little research and the potential for a lot of unplanned expenses and downtime going into the summer months was not a pleasant outlook. Extensive looking led me to this product. Reviews were mostly good so for the cost, if it didn't work, I'm not out of that much, and if it did work, I would have time to set some rainy day money aside. I followed the instructions and my leak stopped immediately. I mean ""Now"". I marked the skimmer side and ran the pool on recirculate for 10 to 11 hours and the level never moved. Dur",1
"Title: People should not complain as much as they do over things that are not that big of a deal.
Review: I have not seen the magazine yet, but for all of you that ate complaining, it's very apparent that it cannot survive on Subscriptions alone nor on Grant's from wealthy donors, and it does not help when each of you keep bit..ing about the ads. Or it might be possible they do not have a number of writers and photographers to keep you interested every month. Furthermore, the individual who was unable to see the rest if the article and the magazine might have been an issue on your end. How well did you treat the Amazon Customer Service when you called to complain? Why don't you splurge and buy an annual print subscription to read. You might find an advertisement for a medication that helps with irritability. The Mental Health community has come",1
"Title: Generous amount. Color-coordinated twist ties
Review: Rl<br /><br />These are printed cellophane bags with Halloween designs on them. You get four different designs. They come with color-coordinated  twist ties for sealing the bags. (I would add color-coordinating ribbon, but you could use only the twist ties if you want.)<br /><br />These will be good for making treat bags, or using for popcorn or cookies.<br /><br />One thing to note is that these bags do NOT have any gussets or square bottoms. They are two pieces of cellophane heat sealed together. So these will NOT stand up on their own.<br />But they would still look cute and stay upright if you put several of the bags in a big bowl.<br /><br />You get a generous amount of bags and ties. This would be perfect for making Halloween goodie b",1
"Title: I. Love. This. Dress.
Review: I bought this dress as an experiment, and I am so glad I did! I have worn it half a dozen times now and I get compliments every time.<br /><br />Because I bought it as an experiment, and because I know at some point someone  (me, probably) would accidentally shove this in the wash, the first thing I did was put it through the washer and dryer like I wash all my other clothes (and my hubs clothes, and my kids clothes, and, you get the idea). Low temp wash and low temp dry is how I roll. This dress came through like a champ. Looks great.<br /><br />[1 caveat: the side zipper is a little bumpy, but that may be because I ran it through the wash like I did.]<br /><br />And... It has deep pockets that don't make it look weird! I can actually put ",1
"Title: Doesn't stay on doors
Review: I used it for my door because we have very thin walls and the door leaks a lot of noise through from my roommate. The door is only slightly textured (wood) but half the panels cannot stay on. They included extra adhesives but they barely held on to the foam and were a pain to peel off. It helps slightly with noise cancellation for the 2 min it stays on but the amount of panels just isn't enough (pretty thin). They're also sending offers out for five star reviews so I came here to write an honest review.",0
"Title: Great for sound mixer rack.  Save my back.
Review: I just received this last week and has already put it to good use 3 days in a row.  I do sound reinforcement for events, and have a populated 10u slanted mixer rack weighing around 140 lbs, which I had to lift at least 4 times for each event, which is a back breaker.<br /><br />I had tried aluminum loading ramp, which is also heavy and bulky to load in the suv (since I need the ramp to load and unload the rack).  Beside that, I still have to push and pull the rack up/down the ramp.  So that didn't work out that well.<br /><br />I decided to try this jack.  It has worked out almost perfectly.  The thing still is a little heavy, but it's a lot more compact than a pair of loading ramps.  It also help with lifting the mixer rack up to the stage",1
"Title: SPF50 Gorilla Glue? Protects BUT... Difficult to Spray, Sticks Forever
Review: I did fight to get it to spray out of the 'locking/safety' nozzle, and it sprays so thickly you still end up rubbing it on.<br />That should have been a warning as although it protected fine the times I used it in full sun, IF you don't remove it (maybe by showering in scalding soap/water? Maybe a quick sulfuric acid wash?) immediately after exercising it will tenaciously remain until you scrub off that epidermal layer!<br />I wanted something protective but light and easy to apply- and shouldn't that include easy to remove?<br />This seems to be designed to hold up to hours of immersion in extremely chlorinated pool water or something.",0
"Title: Pairs with Fitbit. Easy to Use
Review: My first Renpho was destroyed in a bathroom flood, so I had to go out an buy the exact same one.  I love this thing.  It is very accurate and easy to use.  The thin profile makes it easy to slip up against the wall between the counter.  My favorite part is that this scale comes with a SUPER easy free app.  The Renpho pairs with my fitbit so I never have to enter that data.  In addition, my fitbit pairs to my myfitnesspal.. so essentially my weight is tracked in three places all from just stepping on the scale a few seconds.  I am not certain what this product is made out of, maybe glass?  It appears delicate, but seems like it will last as long as I dont drop it.",1
"Title: Zynga allows players to cheat.
Review: Zynga allows players to cheat. I have notified them numerous times about a Boggle With Friends player who has gotten EXACTLY the same score for 23 days in a row. They have allowed this player to continue cheating while telling me the problem is in my app, that the player is just scoring his “average”, that I should update my app, among numerous other excuses.<br /><br />This is not how legitimate companies deal with honest customers. I now suspect that zynga is a somewhat sketchy company and I don’t want their app on my phone.",0

When replacement cd arrived, I tried to play it in all 3 CD players & again it was defective & would not play. All 3 players work fine with other cd’s playing.

"Title: The Wait Is Over!!
Review: I have been reading P Nelson's books since I ""discovered"" them last year.  She writes spicy, hot romances based at a fictional and exclusive BDSM club called The Cage in Vancouver, British Columbia.  And while she's writing, she treats BDSM the way it should be treated, not as some sort of fun toy, but with respect and she also shows that same respect to the practitioners of that wonderful lifestyle.  All that said....<br /><br />This book is, FINALLY, here and now we can read about Calla Jones and Master Flynn Banrock.  The questions are answered, Calla gets to be with the man (and Master) she loves, and Flynn finally admits that his world revolves around her.  And they work through everything that has stood in their way, as if the whole w",1
"Title: Nope—doesn’t work for me
Review: I was excited to receive this product.  It had a lot of positive reviews and I was looking forward to seeing if the hype was true.  Would this multicolored serum provide adequate color correction?  Not at all.  I have a medium complexion, lightly freckled face with normal skin (not too dry or too oily).  I was hoping I would see a difference by using this product before I used my foundation.  I have used it for a few weeks now and I notice no change at all.  No lightening, no brightening and definitely no color correction.  The product goes on smoothly at first then quickly absorbs.  It isn’t sticky, but it isn’t exactly smooth either.  There weren’t any moisturizing properties; the product was actually a bit drying.  The scent is light.  I",0
"Title: Upgrade to a Spreadsheet
Review: The constant advertisements are a PAIN IN THE BUTT and they're on my OWN COMPUTER!  I can't avoid them or . . . if I can . . . I haven't taken the ½ hour tutorial to figure out how.  Additionally, the recent upgrade required me to tell Intuit ALL my contact information over again just so they could send me more junk email and try to sell even more services and products.  Intuit wouldn't let me log in to my own data unless I gave them even more personal information so they could try to sell me more stuff.  If you need to watch your blood pressure, better not even touch Intuit products.  I just wish I could give a zero star.  What I really want is my money back.  Worthless!<br /><br />And don't get me started on Intuit wanting to charge me to",0
"Title: Perfect for thicker dips
Review: Note: I purchase these locally so my review is focused strictly on the chips and will not address ever changing variables like price and shipping.<br /><br />The chips are delicious and go with practically any dip. I use them for some of the creamier cheeses, but they are sturdy enough to lightly spread gorgonzola. They are perfect with hummus too.<br /><br />This is not good for tastings because flavor is not neutral - there is a hint of rosemary and, of course, sea salt. However, the flavor is not so pronounced that it dominates dips and spreads. However, if you are putting out a meze spread, tapas or antipasti these are a wonderful addition.<br /><br />Since this has sea salt the sodium is fairly high. Each one ounce serving (about nine ",1
"Title: NOT a quality sticker. Not even 3x5""! Garbage
Review: I was really looking forward to these stickers; I was going to put them on my AR-15 magazines, but right off the bat I  knew I would be disappointed. The stickers came stuck to the inside of the ziplock bag and they were bent from being thrown in with another shipment. The stickers are NOT 3x5 as advertised, they are about 2-3/4 x 4-3/4"", and the adhesion quality is terrible. I wouldn't expect these to stick on anything save for a clear indoor glass window. Highly recommend buying elsewhere. The only nice thing I can say about them is they have a rich color.  That's it. They are not thick and I wouldn't expect them to hold up to UV rays for any period of time.<br />I don't know how to better describe this, but the stickers have an imprint o",0
"Title: Read before you buy
Review: I purchased the Mityvac MV7400 a few months ago to change the oil in my German (diesel) car. As some of you may know, the oil in a diesel vehicle get extremely BLACK and makes a real mess on whatever it gets on. Well, this morning I used my Mityvac once again and got the same, less than desirable results. This sparked me to write this review!<br /><br />Every time I have used the Mityvac MV7400 it spits oil out from under the black pump handle. There is a small hole just below the black plastic handle that will spit the oil everywhere. At first I thought I may have filled it too full, however, it will do this with less that a gallon of oil.<br /><br />I purchased this thing to make my life easier, however, it has done just the opposite.

"Title: Great Night Lights!
Review: Until I got these, I didn't realize how much I needed them! I wake up earlier than the rest of my family and after I take me shower & get dressed, I head downstairs to enjoy a cup of coffee and some &#34;mom time&#34; before the kids start waking. I don't want to turn on the lights as I go down the stairs, but it's really dark, so I used the screen light (not flash light) from my cell phone to light my way. I always have to push it back on at least one more time before I get to the bottom of the stairs. Now, I have placed one of these lights on the wall of the landing near the top of the stairs and another one in the entry way by the bottom of the stairs. I am amazed at how much light these produce. It's so much better than using my cell ph",1
"Title: John Grisham is a writer not an MD
Review: So let me preface that I am NOT an MD. I have, however, worked in Radiation Oncology for over 10 years.  Yes, HIFU is out there.  So do you know WHY doctors are reluctant to prescribe a brand new treatment they have no historical knowledge to back up??  Hmmm.  They don't know what will happen in 5, 10, 20, even 50 years.  Medicine is based on hard data and there is not enough data for doctors to say what will happen to you years down the road.  Even some therapies, such as Mammosite, are not as popular with some physicians due to lack of long term data.  Yes, the latest and greatest thing always sounds cool, sounds easy and pain free, but John Grisham has not proven to be a prophet either and does not know what the long term side effects co",0
"Title: Duck Bubble Wrap 12 x 60 8 pack Ripped Off by Amazon
Review: I was completely ripped off by Amazon on this order.  Was supposed to receive what I paid for, that being an 8 roll pack of 12'x60' Duck Brand Bubblewrap.  Instead I receive 1 roll, which I ordered October 12th and didn't receive until December 22nd (still have another package in transit since I ordered a qty of 2 of the 8 packs).  There isn't even a place to contact customer service about this. I paid 13.99 for 1 stinking roll of bubblewrap.  I feel completely cheated. I agree with the other reviewer this was a bait and switch.  So Amazon, do you want to pay me for all the other rolls you owe me and maybe some interest on the money of mine you held for 3 months to boot. The most horrible online shopping experience I have ever had.  Additio",0

Review: What a pleasure it is to read another book by Maddie. I really enjoyed going to New Orleans, I just wish they spent more time in New Orleans and I also wish she was more descriptive while there. I always like when books travel to different cities or countries but I also like to hear about the food and different places to go. With that said I very much loved the book and I only have one more left in the series and I'm hoping that Miss Maddie will have written a new one by then. You have alot of fans!!!!!!!",1
"Title: Don't waste your money !
Review: I'm so disappointed for so many reasons. First kit came with the canvas cut crooked and in bottom left cut into picture. I figured I could have frame cover it. I was missing 2 pkgs of the gems out of 8 pkgs. I used other gems. I wrote to this company 3 times .NEVER heard back from them, NOTHING. I decided to try and do this for my granddaughter. The worst rhinestones I've ever worked with. 3 out of 5 we're trash no backing on them. The colors that came didn't match at all . The canvas was shadowed and misprinted in several places. I'm 3/4 way finished and I think I'm gonna scrape it. By far this is the worst diamond art I've bought. The company doesn't care as they never responded. Don't waste your money. I'll never order from this company ",0
"Title: Great Shirts
Review: I just received my order today and I had ordered four different designs(Toy Story, Monster Inc, Finding Nemo, and Lion King) from this company.  The shirts were the actual size advertised. They were super soft, the colors were nice and bright, and the designs on the shirts were in amazing quality.<br /><br />Though keep in mind that the shirts are 100% cotton blend so one should expect over time the shirts may shrink a bit. I am looking forward to wearing the shirts for my upcoming trip this coming spring and many times after that in the future.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like has the ""To Infinity"" brown shirt. It was really really dark brown. I mistaken it as black at first and had to go outside for better lighting to tell it was b",1
"Title: Awesome printer...until it broke in less than 3 years...
Review: All I have to say is wow!!  What a great printer this Canon has turned out to be...It replaced an HP B209 Touchsmart that was the biggest P.O.S. on the planet, that just broke down on me after less than a year's use.  The MG5220 prints quickly and accurately, it is quiet, the design is amazing and the pictures it puts out are beautifully rendered.  I have to say that so far this is the best printer I have ever had, way better than any HP printer I have used for sure.  Highly recommend this unit!!<br /><br />EDITED 11-27-2013<br /><br />Printer is giving me error codes galore, and nothing seems to fix them.  It looks like this printer is broken beyond simple diy repair or resetting, so it will be cheaper just to buy another printer, since it",0

It does begin step by step series of screens promoting Facebook, AARP, etc..I am so fed up I hesitate to even begin pouring through the book itself.  When will publishers ever get it right????

"Title: Honeywell Giveth, Honeywell Taketh Away
Review: 01/09/2015 - I finally found someone at Honeywell 1-855-733-5465 (Brian) who admitted that indeed there WAS an update sent to their entire line of WiFi thermostats late last year that restricted the lower temperature display reading to 40 degrees! The reason was that they found that the temperature sensors were inaccurate below 40 degrees. Their canned response that they were told to say is that they are &#34;Residential&#34; thermostats and therefore do not have to read below 40 degrees. The snowbirds that go south for the winter and come home to broken pipes in the spring will also have to accept that answer.  BEWARE...These thermostats DID at one time read below 40 degrees up until this winter, so don't be lulled into a false sense of se",0
"Title: Thick pages!
Review: Love this book. Just got it. First time user. I did a pen test with the over hundred writing tools/markers/pens that I have and they all passed except for thick sharpie because it's alcohol based. So impressed! Even my brush markers didn't ghost. If you put multiple layers of ink down on top of itself with a dark marker, it will ghost but I'm talking about you need to go over it multiple times. I tested everything from felt tips, to gel, to generic crayola bold, super and fine tips. I tested a tombow, and a zig memory system fine tip. My favorite are the papermate flair ultra fine 0.4.

Upon opening and revealing the canvas, I was impressed at how beautiful and well made it was. It is a very thin canvas and is not very heavy considering it's size.

One day my 3 month old hadnt gone (very regular every day 2x in the morning and 1x evening). You could tell she was uncomfortable.

I'm usually kind of scared to order clothes from Amazon, but this dress was a very pleasant surprise -- the quality of the skirt fabric is fantastic (a thicker, stretch material) and the fit is really flattering! I'm 5'3&#34; 120lbs and size small fit perfectly, with the skirt hitting right at  my knees. I wasn't sure this dress would be worth the price, but I needed something quick (thank you, Prime shipping gods!), so I took a chance and I'm so glad I did!",1
"Title: Terrible Machine & Service
Review: I bought this very expensive washer 2 years ago and have had nothing but problems. Within a month of owning the machine it quit balancing the loads and would either spin forever or not spin at all leaving me with soaking wet clothes. In addition there was a loud knocking noise, burning rubber smell and small rubber particles all over my clothes.  The gasket was stained brown within the first weeks of use despite leaving it open after every wash to dry completely and using all color & fragrant free HE detergent and softener.  I went back and forth with Elextrolux over the repair - terrible service.  Boot was replaced ...same problems. They then wanted to replace the drum and other parts.

"Title: For grave locating, they absolutely work!
Review: I purchased these rods to use exclusively for locating unmarked graves.  I am the clerk for our local cemetery and the burial records for the oldest section of the cemetery, dating back to the 1850s, have been lost.  Many of the headstones have deteriorated away or the graves were never marked to begin with.  A few weeks ago I had a customer who wanted to buy a quarter lot so she could bury her brother next to their father.  There was no stone and no record of a deed sold to that lot.  I had our local sexton come in and he used his probe.  He then took a pair of marking flags, bent them at a 90 degree angle, and proceeded to walk back and forth across the lot.  Every time he would come to the next marked grave, the wires would cross.  I had",1

Review: It is hard to find this kind of case for my HTC Desire Eye. I ordered a Sojitek case, but the magnetic closure didn't work properly.<br /><br />I wanted to return this Reiko one, but the return shipping was costing as much as the case, so I guess its &quot;Prime Free Shipping&quot; status wasn't quite so truthful after all ...<br />The last cover I bought from the manufacturer &quot;Terrapin&quot; on Amazon for my HTC Desire Eye was better. The Terrapin one is no longer available.<br />The Terrapin one: had more cushioning, had a carry-strap, had a smoother texture.<br />This Reiko one: does not have a carry-strap.

"Title: Going, going, gone! We thought there would be too many.....
Review: We love the Byzatine Country Olives, 5-Pound Unit but admit that we love the Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Unit even more. Because I'm not usually fond of too much rosemary, I doubted that I'd like these as much, but I was oh so wrong! The assorted olives, garlic and red peppers are heightened by the large caperberries which I've rinsed off and deposited into a martini on occasion. This is a lovely assortment of Greek olives, each having its own unique texture and taste. If you are an olive lover, I think you'll enjoy this selection which arrives in a vacuum sealed package inside a cardboard box. As soon as I open a bag, I transfer the olives into very clean jars and share them with friends. I also add olive oil in some of the ja",1

Review: This camera has a great interface and a great mobile app.  I can pull it up in seconds, move it about, talk two ways since it has both a mic and a speaker built-in, and generally do anything I'd like with a standalone camera.  But the best part comes if you have a Reolink NVR because the camera can be plugged straight in  or used over wifi to record to the NVR and to be controlled by it.  I just got my NVR, so I haven't tried that out yet, but I'm very excited to have these around my house!  The only downside is that it doesn't support PoE, so if you want a clean one-wire install, this is the wrong camera.",1

I have a sour taste in my mouth because Dr. Tung's sloughed my query off. I would not bother with this toothbrush. It did not achieve anything it promised but behaved on the contrary causing pain.

"Title: Great stand albeit a caveat or two!
Review: The stand is great. It's sturdy, seems solid thus far and is a simple enough endeavor to break down and bag up after a gig. However, I assumed that the top part of the stand that converts it from a standing stand to a taletop stand would have been a removable piece rather than an entirely separate attachment. But that's hardly a big deal. The real issue I have is with this music binder. I don't think that adequate enough words exist in this language that would properly express my utter disdain for the design of this virtually useless binder. It's just some little thing thrown in to sweeten the pot but I would rather it just not have come at all. Again, great stand!",1
"Title: ""Key Piece"" ruined the puzzle!
Review: I have never written a 1 star review, but... I bought this for my son, as he loves his little dachshund. Unfortunately, we were so disappointed! The pieces fit loosely together, which could have been fine, but when he finally got all the pieces together he couldn't get the support piece to screw into the last piece at the end (which happened to be the rear). They would NOT fit together. It's like trying to fit the wrong screw in. Being that it's plastic, it was a disaster! It kept pushing the pieces apart and since the pieces were already loose they started coming apart all over the place and we had to keep putting it back together. Finally I started helping, but 2 of the back pieces eventually broke (the poor dog's leg won't stay on becaus",0

Review: I bought 3 of these so my grandson could mix and match as advertised for fun play.  I bought from 3 different sources hoping to get different robots.  I did not.  They were all identical.  When I contacted the company and asked how I could identify the packages to make sure my child would not have all the same toys on Christmas morning they told me there was no way to identify them and that was part of the fun.  Shenanigans!  It is a way to sell more robots.  I will buy no more of their products and I hyoid them so.",0
"Title: Effective pain relief
Review: The AUVON TENS Unit and EMS machine is lightyears ahead of my old analog unit that resembled a 1960s AM radio and only had 2 channels, this has four!. At one time you needed a prescription to obtain one of these units they cost hundreds of dollars. This is a very comprehensive starter kit, and when I say starter kit, I do not mean it's less effective. It's all-inclusive and more powerful than my original machine with the convenience of a rechargeable battery (vs 9V batteries.) The menu makes it very easy for those who are new to using TENS/EMS machines.  II not for my EMS machine I would not be able to move parts of my body without incredible pain. It's very effective for tendonitis and I reccomend it.",1
"Title: Might better be called, ""love, hate, and treasure""
Review: But this book is a treasure.  Readers interested in WWII and the aftermath will especially appreciate it's somewhat different take on the period immediately following the war.  Aside from the fact that it's simply a very good read, it gives a slightly less black and white picture of the times, especially the attitude toward Jews of not only the Nazis, but many of the Allies as well.  Going back and forth in time and featuring different characters, each layer adds to the picture, until the mystery is unraveled.  But don't expect a happy ending with all the knots unraveled.",1

"Title: The concept is great, but in practice it's not
Review: As with other reviews posted here, this product is not as what is advertised. The concept is great, but in practice it's not. First, the dimensions posted by the seller are not accurate; therefore, the shelf will not fit on your standard 19&#34; rack. I'm a physiologist who has 3 professional racks and have been in this business for 25 years, this is my first time buying a shelf that did not fit. The outer dimensions of the shelf where the crew holes are located are 19 1/2&#34; wide. This extra 1/2&#34; makes all the difference in making it virtually impossible to fit the shelf unless you take a hammer to either your rack or the shelf. The second drawback to this item is that the keyboard sliding shelf does not fit a standard computer keybo",0
"Title: One of My Favorites Now - Low Impact/High Burn
Review: I got the demo not really expecting to enjoy boxing as a fitness game but I loved the demo so much I ended up purchasing the game.<br /><br />It's a great low impact exercise (I was doing a lot of just dance and having knee pain) but still a great workout and burns a decent amount of calories.<br /><br />Don't underestimate the game. It can be a full body workout when you start getting to harder combos with ducks and weaving.<br /><br />The only thing I've noticed is that when there's a large combo with a bunch of moves sometimes it feels like the game lags slightly and I don't get perfects like I do when it's slowed down.  My controllers vibrate when I do the move and they seem off as well when it happens. I googled this issue to see if it",1

It’s accurate against the Pedometer that’s my phone. But what makes a huge difference is I don’t have to put it aside like I do my phone, I could wear it while doing the dishes, the laundry and other obnoxious water involving things. It keeps track it and it never bothers me except the being too still buzz to make me stand and move. I wear it at night to keep track of my sleeping it never gets tangled up or breaks the chain although; I’m getting a spare chain for it just in case. No one knows I’m using Pedometer so I don’t have comments about my weight or my walking And I don’t h",1
"Title: Just when you think you've got it, you get whacked upside the head
Review: I prefer dark humor, wicked language and reading about experiences I don't encounter myself --- Stahl brings me all three.  ""Pain Killers"" is a novel which incorporates an unbelievable yet real evil past with an even more unbelievable present, using a sick sense of humor which I adore.  Like when reading Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen, I stop and say to myself, ""There's no way in the world this could or would happen,"" with Stahl also, I read on, amazed at the brains which come up with these ideas and then put them into words.  I'm envious.<br /><br />""Pain Killers"" deals with subjects I savor, The Holocaust, pharmaceuticals, television, and surgery.  It also brings to forward the dysfunctionality of love and family and the relationships whi",1
"Title: Easy to install screen protectors and protective bumper
Review: I bought this set for my Garmin forerunner 245 am very happy with it. Other screen protectors I have tried on watches easily scratch and/or can be manipulated around the watch face after installation, however, these stay in place and provide good coverage.  I bought these screen protectors as soon as I bought my new watch and my watch ended up having an issue that had to be exchanged and the screen protector came off easy and didn't leave any residue. The case also works well and it looked like it came deformed compared to other, however it is work just fine, if not better than others as it stays on the watch face and is only comes off if you intentionally are taking it off. We have had no problems with it ever coming off, even during worko",1
"Title: Contemptible slander
Review: Patricia Cornwell seems to have needed to recover some of the cash she spent in her alleged &quot;investigation&quot; of Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper. Why else would she publish such unfounded trash? Not only is the book poorly written (need a new editor, Patricia?), but the alleged evidence presented is never more than pure speculation from an accomplished fiction writer! The only thing I got from this book was a sincere desire to sue Ms Cornwell on behalf of Mr Sickert for &quot;slander and Libel! I should hope that this book will not be purchased by anyone else so as to deprive the author of any more revenue that may encourage further garbage. I like a good speculation about the identity of &quot;Jack&quot; as much as anyone might, ",0

Review: I've been coloring my hair at home for a long time. I decided to use something totally different than the few other brands I've come to be happy with. What a mistake!<br />I let the old color grow out for a while. And, after my last hair cut, knew it was time to color. The gray is coming out a bit more. I've seen this brand at the store, so I figured I'd try it out. The description sounds good (sure, every company thinks their product is the best).<br /><br />First off, three of the four points singled out in the beginning of the description on this site turned out to be completely false, in my recent experience (tonight, actually).<br />  - Intense, long lasting color with EVEN RESULTS.  NOPE! My hair was saturated with the product and the",0

Review: I was going to order the all black version of the lettering from the dealer but I saw these first and I love the effect way more! Having the chrome still show to help the black stand off is a dynamic 3D effect.<br />I went with the gloss so that it would shine with the car and blend and I think the effect is beautiful.<br />Putting them on was so easy! I followed the instructions and used the soapy solution, using a small amount of Dawn dish soap.  You don't need too much, a tiny hand held spritz bottle was plenty.  Two sprays per letter and they slid in place and dried quickly. I did it on a breezy, sunny, summer day and was done in 20 minutes.<br />I've gotten compliments on them already!",1

In researching magnesium L-Threonate, which is great, but expensive; I found Magnesium Glycinate is the form best absorbed.  Four years ago, my husband started taking Magnesium Glycinate to control muscle cramps in his legs. We needed to travel so the space saved by only needing one capsule seemed to be a good idea.

"Title: DEAD After Only 14 Months! -- More Expensive To Fix Than Replace.
Review: My previous machine was a KENMORE Top-Loader that lasted an incredible 18 years.  Then, when it was necessary to replace this antiquated laundry hero, I considered a newer high efficiency machine, and ultimately settled on a not-so-cheap LG WM3370HWA, which lured me in with its advanced features.  I felt it might provide an edge cleaning set-in stains, and handling sizeable loads, while reducing impact on the environment.<br /><br />After four months, problems began, with the washing machine and matching dryer, so I called LG support, and they had me place my telephone against the machine and push some buttons so they could listen to tones the machine produced, to find out what was wrong.  Okay, so it told them I needed to change detergent ",0
"Title: Misleading picture: It is not fully transparent
Review: My excitement turned to disappointment the moment I opened the packaging...<br />The picture perfect clear bag on the photo is not what it looks like. In reality, it is screaming with the huge letters of its brand name and other visual pollution. I need a transparent bag with my own label or just see-through clear shell so I will know what I placed inside. I don't need to see a commercial if it's blocking a content view. Totally opposite effect of clear organizing and takes away a zen out of it. At least the company could have put their logos on the bottom so if I need to get another one, I will know where to find it. There is no need to make it shout, like if stressful enough.",0

Each set is protected in plastic and the entire thing comes in a big protective zip-lock bag. So nothing is damaged! My experience with ordering paper products from China has always resulted in disappointment, as something is always damaged or not looking like the picture. So I'm really happy about this!

I repaired the damaged wires but after contacting an authorized parts distributor, after two weeks of waiting I received an e-mail response telling me the manufacturer no longer makes the part I need. This unit is poorly designed. Any engineer who would route small wires near springs that move each time the lid is operated and not provide some type of protection to them should be fired for excessive stupidity. I would suggest anyone looking for this type of appliance look elsewhere than Sanyo. Poor design and lousy customer support are not the hallmarks of a company tha",0

The dealer wanted an arm and two legs.  I found a locksmith March 2021 who would do it for $125.  Took these remotes to him and he was not able to program them.

Seldom do products live up to the advertising hype, but the F1 does.<br /><br />Installation took less time than I budgeted, and that included a visit to the hardware store to get some weatherstripping.

Overall I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this highly.",1

These I just bought, well, more expensive than the hunters I bought, and way more thin material especially near the top. Just don't seem as substantial as the older ones.

Review: The only way this works is to fill the sink with two to three inches of water, pull the plug, and turn it on.  Then it takes several -- many-- seconds to create a strong vortex and pull the water and scraps away.  It seems to be designed for manual dishwashing, where you would have a sink full of dirty water, but I mostly want to clear the sink after food prep.  My previous InSinkErator was fabulous for being able to work with just the sprayer herding scraps into the drain.  This model leaves debris on top of the rubber gasket which I have to push down with my hands.  If I wash a bowl of greens in a two gallon basin and there are tiny bits of leaves, sand, etc, it leaves them in the sink even if the water is poured off while the disposal is",0

Originally purchased it after boyfriend purchased the same case for his son's Samsung s8+. I decided to give it a try for my note 9.  I already had a 360 case by another brand but don't really like the screen protector so wanted to give this case a try.<br /><br />This case is gorgeous and the screen protector is much better quality. However, the stand in the back broke within the first five minutes of being on my phone.

Well this gate is perfect. Extra-strong and is designed to prevent kids or pets from climbing over it and pets and kids can't stick their hands or paws threw it, because of the clear panels. I like this gate because it is pressure mounted and can easily be installed even without the use of any hardware. This gate is ideal for bottom of the stairs and between rooms. Parents and pet owners will love how easily it folds up and how easy it is to store when not being used. I highly recommend it.",1

Review: I love this game!  It's a little similar to Taboo in that you are getting another player to guess the pairs on your card but the only 'Taboo' words are the pairs themselves.  We have played it numerous times with different friends and whenever we get together for game night, this game almost always gets requested.<br /><br />I love that you don't have a team you play with.  This game is set up so that each player will give a clue to each other (Ex. Player 1 gives clues to Player 3, another round Player 3 gives clue to Player 2, etc...)  You end up guessing and giving clues to each person playing.  Some of the cards seem easy but that 45 second timer goes quickly and some pairs may seem easy until you are trying to guess them.<br /><br />Thi",1

Review: I took some lessons with them when I lived in California. Since I moved, I've been able to keep up through their videos. It's amazing how much you can get out of them. Sometimes even more than an in-person lesson, because of the thoughtful editing, and the ability to rewind, slow down, and practice the moves again and again.

Things only got more violent, sicker & more twisted.  This is one of the darkest, most sickening tales I've ever read.

Review: Both me and my baby have been traumatized a couple of times when cutting his nails (accidently hurting my baby is the absolute worst. Mom guilt to the max). Someone recommended this to me, and I’m so glad I tried it. It takes only a few seconds to sand down each of my baby’s nails, and less than two minutes to do both of his hands. My baby is extremely squirmy, and this took away the worry of accidently clipping him with the sharp clippers. This does have regular nail clippers attached, but I do not use them. It also has a built-in light that actually is quite useful. This does come with a charging cord, but does not come with a wall adapter, which isn't a real issue for me since I have a ton of wall adapters at home. This comes with five d",1

Review: The outside design of the lego-like bricks is what drew me in, it's beautiful. Everything else, unfortunately falls very short. As you slide it you can hear all the loose magnets inside. When it's sliding, there's a gritty sandpaper feel to it and just makes me cringe like nails on a chalkboard. The middle was not responsive at all, so I took it apart to see why, and it's because (by design) there are a lot of gaps inside where magnets should be. I attempted to add more magnets myself to make it more enjoyable but the internal design makes it impossible. I do not recommend this, even as a beginner's fidget slider.",0
"Title: Suction cups are cheap
Review: Suction cups are garbage. They do not work right. They're like the dollar store ones, that are almost a rubbery plastic rather than a thick rubber like quality ones you'd find on a GPS or phone mount for a windshield. Granted, they don't need to be that strong, but due to the cheapness of the suction cups, it won't even hold up a dry sponge. I have even used rubbing alcohol to clean the stainless steel sink just to make sure there is absolutely nothing behind the suction cups. Garbage suction cups really cripple an otherwise great looking sponge holder.",0

Review: Let's compare Frangoulis to his peers, not to Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras. He is no where even close to opera. He is nowhere even close to Bocelli, Watson, or Amante. All of whom can carry their voices at least 1/2 way through an opera house. Frangoulis's voice wouldn't even carry the front row. Ladies, keep the moist spots down to a quiver. Concentrate on  the lack of substance in his voice. Nothing is there. He does not connect. Like not a Bocelli, Watson or even Michael Amante does. There's a reason he is not a star in the U.S. It's called lack of talent. Get over it ladies. Stick to your stiff night sticks and forget about Frangoulis!",0

I have to say that we are very pleased.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed when unpackaging was that everything seem to be designed and made with attention to detail and care.  That was a little surprising for us. Many times you get cheap packaging and apps that look like they were created in a single afternoon. Not so in this case. We had to double check to verify that this is a start up company. By all outward indications, it feels like it’s a well polished company that has been in business for quite some time.

Review: 1.  I just received this T-shirt.  Amazon (or the vendor) sent this item individually in a thin, un-sealed zip-lock bag.  With no further protection, the address label is just stuck on top.  Fortunately it hasn't been raining these few days.<br />2.  After I tried it on, a lot of fiber was left sticking on my body.  And after the first hand wash, I noticed the laundry water's color turned to brown and laden with clumps of fine fiber that came out from the shirt.<br />3.  Of course I am not satisfy with this product.  The quality is way inferior than those I can get from retail stores.  But since I have put it to wash, I have no way to return it.",0
"Title: Made in China.  Much better than gas for my needs.
Review: This chainsaw has a 16 inch bar, weighs 15 1/2 lbs, has overall length of 35 inches, width of 8 1/2 inches, and height of 10 inches. It’s outer is made of a sturdy plastic-type material with a grippy area on the trigger handle. Looks are attractive. The wrench that is used to adjust the tension on the chain is held neatly on the underside of the unit. It does take chain lube, so there is a reservoir built in that needs to be filled as necessary for use. No chain bar oil is included with the unit. It has a chain lock guard to stop the chain if the saw kicks back. The battery itself is a 60Volt 5.0Ah design that measures 5 1/2 x 5 1/2 x 7 inches and has a nice, grippy handle on the top for removal to charge. The included charger allows the ba",1
"Title: A New Take on Old School Composition Notebooks.
Review: First thing worth noting about these notebooks is the size. They are SMALLER SCALE - the size of old school composition notebooks - 7.5"" x 9.75"". Think of this as a remake of those. As such - they are a big improvement. They open flat and have college ruled perforated pages. They also have a nice thick plastic cover, front and back, offering durablility without the bulk. I really like this new take on those old notebooks. They are far more practical, lacking only the sentimental appeal of the black and white marble cardboard cover we are all used to. As an aside - I was expecting pastel colors and instead received primary colors. Still - these are great notebooks to either use as composition notebooks, or to scale down the size of the stand",1
"Title: Lighted helmet!
Review: I was able to wear this with a low ponytail fine.<br />I liked that it had a light on the helmet on the rear for safety.<br />I'm not that much of a biker to know when to use what visor or why I need two options, but the visor option did help with the sun.<br />It was easy to switch visor options to see which one I liked better with my face shape, but I'm sure that wasn't the goal of the options. It fit comfortably and having the extra padding by the strap around my chin strap was nice. The padding is removable, which is nice, also.",1
"Title: Don't waste your money.
Review: Three times the retail cost thanks to scalpers and simply repackages two other collections that are sold separately anyways.<br /><br />Requires downloads and updates out of the box. One of the collections, 2.8 isn't worth the cost of admission considering it is simply a animation, a game and a demo.<br /><br />Once PSN stops offering the downloads and services needed to properly play these games, this product becomes essentially worthless.<br /><br />If you MUST play these games, don't bother with the overly expensive physical collection, just buy it digital, since for all intents and purposes the game disk are essentially physical copies of redirects for the downloads anyways.",0
"Title: Terrible! No sole, look awful after one use
Review: This review is for the girls pink lace up boot… the sole is so thin, it looks very strange. The first thing I noticed when I opened them is the tiny, like millimeter thick little sole on the bottom.  Then my daughter wore them and they look like she’s been wearing them for a year.  The suede-like material just holds on to dust, dirt, sand, whatever.  They looked so bad after one use that she’s never even worn them again… which is all the same because with that sole they probably wouldn’t have lasted long anyway.  Worst shoe I’ve ever purchased.",0
"Title: Finally a winter where I’m not battling White Walker hands
Review: Usually by mid to late winter, my hands have deteriorated into painful, scaly abominations thanks to the prolonged dryness. Lotions containing colloidal oatmeal are the only ones that offer any relief or heal my hands once they start to get raw, but this year I have managed to avoid them even getting to that state by using this lanolin, and I’m not even particularly good about using it regularly.<br /><br />Yes, it smells like a barn, that’s how you know it’s legit and not over processed. I’m fine with it. The smell goes away eventually, and it’s a small price to pay to not have painfully raw flaking skin. And as a knitter who works with natural fibers, I recognize the sheepy smell and don’t find it that offensive. Best to use this before a",1

Review: They state that these are replacement for the original cups and the second picture clearly shows a lid with a flip close sealing mechanism.  These DO NOT have a sealing mechanism for the lid despite what the picture shows. If you have liquid in this cup and it tilts, it will spill out.<br /><br />Not as advertised...<br /><br />UPDATE:  They appear to have removed the other pictures showing the lids with flip closed tab<br /><br />UPDATE 2:  Once again false advertising has crept in to the pictures as of 8/26/19.

"Title: Enlightening discussions on world peace
Review: This journal has articles on a variety of topics that are related to world peace. It speaks to an international audience and has been in continuous publication for 25 years. One thing that I love about this journal is that it publishes different viewpoints from people around the world. It provides a forum for young scholars to promote new research, and it promotes dialogue. You won't find vitriolic essays from the usual pundits here; the essays are reasoned, civil, and constructive. I highly recommend the International Journal on World Peace to those who are ready for an international and interdisciplinary perspective on shaping a more peaceful world.",1
"Title: Smells like poop...literally
Review: I purchased the Seaweed Bath Co. Active Defense SPF 50 Sport with Aloe and Watermelon from Whole Foods and it smells like literal poop.  I've never returned a sunscreen before, but I'm going to see if I can return this because of the poop scent. I wish I had read the review about how it smells like an elephant habitat beforehand, but I agree with that reviewer. As soon as I put the sunscreen on, I knew I had made a mistake and thought, ""oh, lord, this smells like poop"".  The elephant habitat review confirmed that I wasn't hallucinating.  I'm not at all sensitive to scents, so please know that it's bad.  It's so bad.",0
"Title: Great look, great value, perfect for an industrial look
Review: Great pendant to go with an industrial modern look and feel (and finally replace the glass and chrome I've been trying to get rid of...).  These lights were one of the last pieces in my home I needed to install to finish off the look I'm trying to achieve.<br /><br />Hands-down the best thing about the lighting was the price; unfortunate to see it has more than doubled now. Not sure how I received such a great price but no complaints, other than I want to buy one more pendant just in case I ever have a need for three.  They were easy to install. I would say the overall quality is a good four out of five.  Comes with a generous amount of cordage if you have taller ceilings,  I ended up getting rid of at least 2 feet of the cord, and my light",1
"Title: Christmas in the Lake Country
Review: Alan Sutton Publishing has a series of these ""Christmas anthologies,"" excerpts from diaries and novels in the area of England noted in the title (a few are done for eras, like WARTIME CHRISTMAS and BRONTE CHRISTMAS), the first which I bought at a book sale several years ago.  I had two others picked out originally, then decided to get this one and A FENLAND CHRISTMAS because of thoughts of Beatrix Potter and Lord Peter Wimsey, respectively.<br /><br />I was expecting a selection from Potter, actually, or something about her life on her beloved Hill Top Farm, but instead was amused to find her included in ""Party Time at Sawrey,"" the remembrances of a young ""cottager"" who attended the children's parties given by the wealthier members of the c",1

Review: I admit it, I bought this for myself.  I am retired and looking for things to do.  I have alot of fun with this.  I use it to clean up after my dogs and it takes a crappy job and actually makes it fun.  I also tried a little snow removal with it and found that enjoyable to.  The controls are responsive and it won't when any prizes for it speed but what do you need it to.  I like the fact I can turn off the lights and noice it makes, I really don't need that. I'm also impressed with how long the batteries last.",1
"Title: No good
Review: I had hoped these would help my 2 kids. It looked promising. I put one bag on the back of each chair. My son put his plastic EMPTY water bottle in 1 of the bags, just as he was getting out of the car. The next day we get back in the car to find it laying on the floor. The only thing inside was the empty plastic bottle. The bag that had nothing inside was still on the back of the chair. These could possibly work if you have only paper to throw away, like receipts. Even then, you couldn’t let it get too full as it seems any weight at all make the bag fall.",0
"Title: Perfect for my project
Review: Used this while putting the engine bay of my Scout II Traveler back together.  Originally they had used a a form of butyl that was dabbed and spread in different areas.  This was great to work with for attaching items to the fire to seal holes and keep things from rattling.  The name does say tape, but don't expect it to hold anything together, it's simply a filler to seal gaps.  In some cases I cut shorter strips and stretched it out so I wouldn't have to deal with as much squishing out, but it's easy enough to cut off what squishes out with a plastic blade.  Very soft and sticky when warm, but also stiff when cold.  Around 65F is a good working temperature for installation.",1
"Title: Too expensive- MLM product- buy another brand on Amazon
Review: I got a sample of this from a friend who is part of the MLM that sells this. The price is outrageous. I pointed out to her that you can get chia seeds for 25% of the cost of Mila. There is no magic with Mila- it's overpriced because it's a multilevel marketing scheme.<br /><br />I do like chia however- just not from Mila. i have  TBSP 3 x a day with 2 glasses of water. I do not care for it in food and like the ground Mila rather than the seeds. Goes down better and I get the benefit of the water too!<br /><br />Just read that Chia MUST be ground or milled to be effective. Whole seeds just, uh, go right through.",0

Review: Have you ever just wanted to say Goodbye to free your soul. Well, here goes. My buying from Amazon became one of convenience. It was great at the beginning. I needed something, buy it, and it shipped. As I ordered more and more items, I found that prompt shipping came with a heavy price.

"Title: Face it, Korn is DEAD!
Review: What ever happened to Korn. It's like they took a break after Issues and said &quot;Hey, let's start becoming more mainstream and sellout&quot;. Well, &quot;Untouchables&quot; was only the beginning. While that album warranted 3 stars max, this one doesn't even the 1 star I gave it (I only gave it that because Amazon won't let you go any lower, if I had it my way, I'd give it no stars at all). Take A Look In The Mirror, is a waste of time and money. I listened to it once, tried listening again, but just couldn't do it, it was just pointless, I had already wasted 50 minutes of my life, and I wanted it back, so I took it to the Wherehouse, traded it in and bought some better music (Soul Embraced &quot;Immune&quot; and Live &quot;Birds of Pray",0

"Title: Horrible product, and shipping from seller ""Gravity-US"" not worth the wait and shipping.

I finally received it 1/13/2014. I paid $4.13 in shipping and handling and I get a package that came in beat up and wrapped with a black plastic bag and tape. When I opened it one of the colors popped out of the plastic holder. Good thing this wasn't a gift. I would be embarrassed to give this to someone. Not sure if this is a issue with the seller or product itself, Ive seen the product at the store and it looked like it was printed at the factory. The one I got from the seller it looked like the box was copied and its a fake.",0
"Title: Thin and uncomfortable
Review: i have an obsession with slippers... that's almost all I wear.  I really was excited about trying these because they look so soft and fluffy. The only thing I like about these slippers is that they are soft to the touch. Walking on them is like walking on the bare floor.  For some reason the left foot is very crooked and when I walk my heel comes off of the slipper and actually hits the floor.  Also, the thing part where you put your toe is plastic and cuts into your toes is awful<br />I was pretty disappointed. I hate leaving bad reviews so it hurts to have to write this.",0
"Title: Never miss your luggage on the carousel again!!!
Review: These tags arrived just at the right time as we are going on vacation next week and will be using luggage.  These tags are like nothing I have ever seen.  They are approximately 2 1/2 by 4 1/2 square of a PC composition with a metal ring at the top.  They are attached to your luggage with a steel cable that screws open and closes when attached.  The cable is super strong to never leave your luggage handle.<br />These tags are bright colored and also larger than most so that locating your luggage is much easier.  On the upper side of the tag are 5 lines of information in white that you can write with a permanent marker.  The construction of these tags are very strong and they are made flexible so snapping or falling off will almost be imposs",1

"Title: Not Near As Good As Addi Rubo
Review: So I bought the ChiaoGoo circular needles some time ago and am finally using the first one- a 32"" No. 6  on a sweater for my large husband.  I worked off the 20"" Addi turbo onto the 32"" ChiaoGoo and I must say that the Chinese product is incredibly inferior to the German, not that we're surprised, just disappointed.  For starters, the needles on the ChiaoGoo are stainless; the needles on the Addi needles are nickel plated- the Addies are much, much faster- the ChiaoGoo have about as much drag as the aluminum Susan Bates that you can get just about anywhere.  The other problem with the ChiaoGoo needles is the cording, and this is my primary beef with them: I'm used to my work just slipping along the blue nylon cord on the Addies; the ChiaoGo",0

This is a good sized doll. It isn’t too big or too small so she can carry it along and it doesn’t seem overwhelming.<br /><br />I am pleased with the quality of the doll. My kids had no problems with her. She held up well to their handling.<br /><br />This would also make a very nice gift. My girls like getting dolls the best of all.<br /><br />She is reasonably soft. She looks just like the picture. I think the price was fair. I would recommend it.",1
"Title: Look for ""Spanish for Kids""
Review: I was terribly disappointed with this dvd. After reading the reviews, I couldn't wait for it to get here. However, both my husband (who is spanish speaking) and I felt it was more for entertaining than learning. We have really enjoyed the one DVD we got that is called &#34;Spanish for Kids: Adentro y Afuera&#34; I was looking for something a little cheaper, but now realize I'll be sticking with the &#34;Spanish for Kids&#34; DVD's.<br /><br />My kids have watched this dvd twice and haven't said one word in spanish. After watching the &#34;Spanish for Kids&#34; dvd once, they had already picked up a couple of spanish words and knew what they meant.

"Title: It will move you to tears of repentance
Review: This CD is volume 2 of a two-volume set (each sold separately -- volume 1  is for Rosh Hashanah).  It was originally produced for Public Radio  International in 1996, a year after the broadcast of the Rosh Hashanah  album, and it features the same performers (with both male and female  voices).<br /> The music is done a capella, just as it would be on Yom  Kippur itself. (In consideration of those who feel the Name of God should  not be pronounced except in real worship, the Name is rendered  &quot;Adomai&quot;, with an &quot;M&quot; instead of an &quot;N.&quot;)  From the opening with a soulfelt &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; to the closing  shofar blast, this is a liturgical CD that will open your heart to God.

Review: It was worth the wait! This is honestly a high quality outfit given the price. I wasn’t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. The jersey itself is comfortable. The shorts have the white mesh insert which makes it feel more authentic, too.<br /><br />I would suggest ordering a size up if you want a looser fit. Obviously these are Asian sizes, so I got the biggest size and it was fitted (I’m 5’7” and 260 lbs FYI). So any plus-sized gals looking to represent their Haikyuu boyfriend can be rest assured you’ve got options.",1

About an hour after I put it in the back of her neck, she clearly was not feeling well. Her eyes were squinting and she developed this awful twitching, and drooling. She then defecated on our bedroom floor, which she has never ever ever done outside of her box in her whole 8 yrs of life.<br /><br />I immediatly bathed her with Dawn as another person suggested that they did when this happened to their cat, and we just got out of the tub.

Review: I tried ordering N95 masks from another company that sells Made in USA, but they never arrived, so I found these.  I don't care about the color, I care that they are NIOSH approved.  Would have been awesome if they were individually wrapped, but not a deal breaker and doesn't diminish my 5 star rating.  They are headband style, which means they are NIOSH approved, and each mask has the approval stamped on the mask, ear loop masks are NOT N95, they are KN95, and I would rather spend the extra money and get masks made in the USA, and are NIOSH approved.  These also come with user instructions, which is amazing.  Will certainly order more.",1

"Title: Excellent Strategy Game
Review: Caylus is an excellent worker placement game. It does take quite a while to play (2-4 hours) but the time is worth it. You won't even notice the time go by while playing.<br /><br />Caylus has a theme of you trying to help build the castle and getting kings favors for working on it. You place your workers on different buildings allowing you to obtain different goods like wood, stone, food, etc. You use this food to build other buildings or to help build the castle.<br /><br />The parts of Caylus are very well built. As with most Euro games it includes wooden bits instead of plastic bits. The buildings are all printed on thick cardboard and are well built.<br /><br />Other than the time investment, there aren't a lot of negatives about this ",1

I also have gum issues and I normally use ACT restoring mouthwash as an aid to my gums and teeth. Problem is, I can't use ACT at night before I go to bed due to the alcohol content.

A one gallon the can is not useable as the water is at the very top and any movement whatsoever causes it to spill. The real capacity is 6-7cups not 8 as advertised.

Review: At first when I got it my dog was interested in it but would get the treats out a little too quickly to get a lot of time out of it.  I then put it away for a bit and forgot about it but recently I got it back out and I got the idea to put kibbles in there - then he could have a higher amount of things coming out.  He LOVES it.  He works on this thing forever and gobbles up his kibbles like they are gold and this is funny because he has a whole bowl full in the laundry room of the exact same kibbles.  He's not a big eater, especially of kibbles so I found this amusing.  He really likes it, the one negative is that he barks at it which I don't like.  I think he's doing that because he's either frustrated or excited but he keeps at it and enj",1

"Title: Great VK Mini-Album
Review: Versailles was one of the best Visual Kei bands out there. This mini-album is from their original incarnation, before the passing away of Jasmine You. There are only 3 tracks, but they are good ones. The first track, Prince, I would classify as a Rock Ballad type of song. The second track, Princess, is a little harder to classify. It has soft melodic parts and some lightning fast hard rocking parts. Sort of half-ballad, half arena rock. The third track is an instrumental. Silent Knight showcases the incredible skill of the band members. The high adrenaline guitar work in this piece is what got me hooked on Versailles in the first place.",1

Very straightforward and easy to get started with whether the adult has a background in programming or has never programmed before in their life.

"Title: Heache -- only for the Chinese Market or someone who wants to tinker with a phone
Review: I bought this from Amazon Market sold by CN-WORLD. This was nothing but a headache: would not recognize any Tmobile or AT&T sim cards. So only wifi worked -- thus for me, it was an expensive wifi tablet. In addition, the google play store would not open, the Hauwei App store was not on the phone, but rather something called Mobo Market. Google services would not load, so you can never sync any google apps, if you were lucky enough to download them by this non-official google store. This is strictly a Chinese market phone. The seller, CN-World emailed me that they had rooted the phone before sending. I did not want a rooted phone. In any case, it did not work.

"Title: It works, but attaching it was problematic. Look elsewhere.
Review: TLDR: It does what it is designed to do, but due to the difficulty of installation and lack of instructions, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to like this paddle clip. I thought it would be great to clip the paddle and forget about it while I fish or just lay back and enjoy whatever view I was taking in. Although it works, I had to jerryrig it to my kayak because of the lack of instructions and the seemingly wrong set of hardware included.<br /><br />I consider myself pretty handy, having worked in the construction field and as a mechanic for a while, and I could not make heads or tails of the hardware set that was included. As I said, there were no instructions and I felt that the two ",0
"Title: Nice armband for hands free iphone use
Review: This is a very nice sports armband for the iphone.  I have an iPhone 6 and it fits really well into this armband.  I do have to take it out of the case, but my phone is in a large wallet type case so of course that wouldn’t fit in there!  I think if you had a really slim, low-profile case you might be able to get it in there without taking the case off. The armband also makes it really easy to get your headphones plugged in.  The touchscreen is still accessible and responsive through the plastic window which is great.<br /><br />I have relatively small arms and this fit around my upper arm just fine.  I always find these types of armbands a little tricky to get on (since you have to do it one handed) but it’s not bad once you figure out how",1
"Title: Nice looking, lots of room, and quiet!
Review: Giving this 5 stars for now.  We have only had it in service for a couple of weeks but are very happy with it.  It looks great in our kitchen.  I was concerned because of other reviews which said it was noisy, but so far ours is extreamly quiet.  There is a lot of room in this frig.  It looks empty compared to our old one.  The LED lighting is great and makes it easy to see everywhere in the frig.  We did have one minor issue.  The deli drawer controls did not work.  I called GE and they quickly sent out a tech who replaced a board in the frig and all is good now.  For now, this is a short term review, but if things change, I'll update.",1

Review: I live in what would seeming be an older, quieter neighborhood, but it has been the target of repeated break-ins. The house directly across the street from me is a weekend lake home and someone pulled up in a moving van and robbed it in broad daylight. Because it was a weekend home no one suspected any foul play. The house to my left had the front door kicked in while the folks were at work….during the day.  The house to my right had their cars broken into and the radio systems stolen. The window in the back of my house on the lower level was kicked in, but they did not go into the house mainly because I have 4 barking dogs…….I think. Most of my neighbors have put some sort of security system in except me. I am using the SABRE security deca",1

I just ended up sending it all back and I ordered another suit ordered another suit was a little bit more expensive but better quality and much better f",0
"Title: Excellent gift for a young Marine Infantryman. 100% Grunt Proof.
Review: I was looking for a sheath for my son who is a new Marine Infantryman. I had a Ka-Bar when I was a Marine and I could hang it from my Load-bearing harness and belt. The Marines today need to attach the Ka-Bar to their Plate-Carriers. I read the reviews and examined the pictures. I saw one review that gave one-star and I was a little nervous to order this after reading such a bad review. I received it and I'm very pleased. It's very sturdy and fits the knife perfectly. It mounts to the plate carrier in multiple places and works perfectly with off the shelf  Molle attachments. I strongly recommend this product. It follows the dictum of Marine equipment design, it's Grunt Proof. I will have my son send me a picture and post it on here.",1
"Title: No problems
Review: This smoke detector was very good. It was very easy to put up. We got it up easily and securely in no time at all. It looks fine. It blends in okay with the ceiling. It is pretty much the standard size most of them are. It didn’t take long to set up at all.<br />It seems to work just fine. We tested it and it worked without a problem. It was very loud and noticeable, which of course is important if there is a fire.<br />I like that it has the long-lasting sealed battery. It is nice not to have to worry about it for a long time. We are having some work done and the city said it needed to be this type in order to pass inspection.<br />I thought the price was reasonable. I would recommend it.",1
"Title: Good guiter for a novice
Review: I purchassed this because I always wanted to learn to play guitar. I am just a beginner (in my 40's), but it appears to be quality construction and it sounds pretty good. It came with a tuner, but I have never used it because I have a nice electronic tuner. The strap is cheap, but you can buy a nice, leather Levis strap on Amazon. The soft case only unzips at the end, not along the case length, so it can a little difficult to get the guitar in and out. But the guitar deserves 5 stars, especially considering the price.",1
"Title: Not A Winner
Review: My wife tried out this product alleged to provide a more comfortable hair removing experience. That claim turned out to be nothing more than a bunch of hooey. There is no detectable difference in hair removal with or without the use of these wipes. The wipes do add an odor to the legs but how many times do you have a leg sniffer come up to you, sniff your legs and remark on the pleasantness of your leg odor? Who would pay 12 bucks, shipping included, to purchase wipes to provide nothing more than some leg fragrance? Not my wife.",0
"Title: It's okay for the price. But won't fit on a phone with any kind of case on it.
Review: The picture quality is okay. The buttons on both sides do nothing. You focus by turning the dial on the side which moves the lens in and out. Zoom is actually you moving the camera closer or further away and adjusting the focus. There's a dial on the cord to adjust the brightness which will only dim so far before it turns completely off. Worked with both the phones I tried it on (Galaxy S10+ & Galaxy A71), but not so much with my computer. Sometimes it will work but more often it gives me an error message. My computer does not have a disk drive so the installation software disk was useless. The adapter for USB C is too big to fit past any phone case, so you must take your phone out of it's case to insert it into your phone. The stand is a j",0
"Title: Lightweight, Easy, powerful
Review: This little machine is fantastic. It’s powerful. It’s easy to carry and go the stairs. It’s easy to pull behind. And it’s easy to clean. When we moved I wanted to try something besides an upright. There’s no comparison. It gets all dirt and dust right up to the baseboards edge and it easily cleans under furniture and cabinets. Our house is all hard floors downstairs. It cleans quickly- makes it a breeze. Easy to get under and around odd pieces of furniture, like 3 legged iron side tables. I’m extremely impressed. My one con would be the short cord. But I’m getting a long extension cord to use with it. Easy fix.",1
"Title: Super clean laundry, lightweight, time consuming
Review: Update- 16 months after purchase,  this washer is functional again. Turns out that there was a sock stick in the drain of the spinner side.  It must've flown out of the spinner during a spin cycle.  I now know to use the white round thingy as a spinner cover when I have small items in there.  I use this for baby/kid clothes,  delicates, cloth napkins,  and cleaning rags. I don't recommend doing towels in here.  It does a terrible job at filtering out towel fuzz. It is best for small loads that you don't mind air drying.  I sometimes use this to make up a load for the dryer. It takes me all day to get a load that large done,  between varying for my kids and manually doing the load, it's very time consuming.  However, everything comes out rid",0

Review: When I sent for this, I really was not expecting a lot.  I figured it would be a weanie type fan that would be neither impressive or helpful.  However..  well, let's take a look..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS FAN LIKE?<br />This fan is pretty straight forward.  It is about 10 inches tall, and has a foot print of 4x4 inches.  It is a swirled plastic form like you see in the photo.  There is a grate which takes in the air, and long vents that push it out.<br /><br />CONTROLS<br />The controls are TOUCH.

I was anticipating this package, but seriously...thrown at the front door?  Anyways, regarding the filter...my filter was clogged.  The water coming out was at a trickle.  I was so glad that when this was replaced, the water from the fridge gushed right out.  You are supposed to let the first gallon or so filter out prior to drinking.

Review: The most BORING movie related remotely to Martial Art!<br />If there is a vote on the most boring movies that ever filmed in the Ancient Worlds of China.  It is certainly listed as one of the top ten.  I would rate it as the worst.  Some viewers said the cinematography is great.  I feel it is OK, not bad.  By the way, there is no nothing wrong with the actresses and actors.  I watched many of their movies and they act well.  I have watched hundreds of movies in the Ancient Worlds of China and its cinematography is nothing extraordinary.  You could compare it with the films from Director Wong Kar-wai and Director  Zhang Yimou.  The problem is that the Director is more interested in making the movie &#34;different&#34; and &#34;artistic&#34; ",0
"Title: This isolator completely solved a speaker hiss problem
Review: I have one computer speaker system that accepts inputs from two sources.  I connected two computers to it only to find that I got a seriously annoying hiss from it under certain conditions when the video card was being used intensely.  Researching, I guessed that the two computers and their connection to the speaker system formed a ground loop.  This unit has tiny isolation transformers in it which break that loop and stopped the hissing perfectly with no negative effect on the sound quality.  A very inexpensive way to solve a very annoying problem.",1
"Title: Not just for pet food! Kind of a loose fit
Review: Ideally, these needed to have a slightly tighter fit. They barely hold on to the various can sizes, and a snugger fit would just be more secure. Having said that, it fits a wide variety of cans! Not just pet food! This is a great multi pack for your kitchen, with enough to share with friends or loved ones. Super versatile item, dishwasher safe, and fun colors. The tab on the side makes it easy to put on and takeoff. I love that it’s one size fits most. I took a few photographs so you could get a sense of the scale and functionality. I hope you find this review helpful!",1
"Title: Other remotes (TV) cause the fan to do different things!  :(
Review: Nice fan in and of itself. I keep it in the living room for when we are watching TV. The problem is that whenever I pick up my Amazon Fire remote to adjust the TV volume, it makes the fan beep loudly and activates the fan's oscillating function and the fan starts to swivel. If I have the fan on low setting, the Amazon remote will make the fan go full blast. And so on.<br /><br />I only unboxed it a few hours ago and it's already driving me nuts.<br /><br />I work crazy hours, I don't have time to return it, so I'm stuck with it. The fan itself is fine but I don't recommend buying it unless you are going to use it in a room where you don't have any other remote controls.",0
"Title: Not durable, NOT for aggressive chewers.
Review: This lasted less than an hour in the jaws of my persistent, but not particularly powerful chewer. She got the rope untied on one end, took the chew toy off, and then proceeded to quickly begin shredding the rubber ball. Obviously, I took that away from her, but left the rope for her to play with.<br /><br />Even the rope is poorly made.

"Title: Nicely made and a pleasure to use!
Review: I really like the frosted glass housing and how it's put together. The cord is plenty long enough to reach where needed without getting in the way. I enjoy the options of the many different colors, works great as a night light (even if the &#34;dim&#34; settings could stand to be less bright), and I appreciate that it reminds me it's running because it's still lit and then shuts everything off, light included, when it's done with the cycle or runs out of water. I don't always use essential oils in it, but I enjoy the intermediate setting for when I do and it continues all day or all night!

"Title: Beautiful Chrome Finish
Review: The GROHE Ladylux is a real looker if you ask me. It reminds me a little bit of a tire iron for your vehicle, and it has the same heft and weight to match.<br /><br />But that's not what's to love about it.<br /><br />First of all, is the intuitive design for turning the faucet on and off. It is controlled by knobs instead of by a lever, which I believe may be difficult when all soaped up, but it certainly looks great.<br /><br />The second thing you'll note is the sheen and sheerness of it all. This faucet needs to go in a high performing sink. Something super sleek and cool looking that you might see in Iron Man's bathroom.<br /><br />Jokes aside, the pull out mechanism on this faucet is really a thing of beauty. It reminds me a bit of go",1

Review: ...Well, a mixed economy.  I don't think full-blown socialism is very effective.  But listening to Dead Prez, I was able to identify with many of the shortfalls of unfettered corporate capitalism.  As the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, you need more and more police and military to defend the status quo and spread false propaganda to the ignorant masses.<br />Most modern hip-hop, unlike the old school stuff, is polluted with too much corporate wealth.

"Title: All but Symphony 4 are superb, and the sound defies its age completely
Review: Sergiu Celibidache, the generally accepted master of slow, believed that slower tempi enabled the listener to have a ""transcendent experience"" in response to the music.  Reportedly indeed, his concert-goers sometimes received that very benefit.  To be fair, Celibidache would be as likely to take fast tempi faster than the accepted norm as well.  Despite the criticism of tempi taken, few can deny that this conductor possessed the almost magical ability to bring a fresh perspective to much that he conducted.  In the present DG set of Brahms four symphonies, Celibidache leads the SWR Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra in performances recorded in 1974, 1975, and 1976.  These recordings have been remastered using original bit processing which, a",1

Review: As a reviewer on Amazon UK has pointed out, the tracks listed are not those on the actual CDs.<br /><br />Disc Two and Four are correct.<br /><br />Disc One is ALMOST correct. However, when you insert the disc in your player it will list 20 tracks, and not 19 as advertised on the rear cover. This is because between tracks 3 and 4 &#34;Four O'Clock Blues&#34; has been omitted. All 14 tracks of the original album are on the CD, but the listing for this 1 track has not been printed on the rear cover. So, therefore, all the track numbers from &#34;Mister Freddie&#34; onwards have to be shuffled forward one.<br />The biggest kerfuffle is Disc Three though.<br /><br />Tracks 15 through 19 are correct (the first 5 tracks from the album 'Alone with",1

Review: To set the context, I've been working with network technology for 20+ years (having set up many networks).  I apparently made a rookie mistake by thinking a $62 device like this would easily solve my wifi/ethernet needs for an IP phone.  The core issues with this device are as follows:<br /><br />(1) The setup software, while simple is not nearly as intelligent as what you get with Linksys.<br />(2) The error reporting is good (to a point), but once you get stuck, you truly will remain stuck.<br />(3) The support line is not very good and they can help you through the basics for dummies.<br />(4) I spent 2+ hours diagnosing this TP device and why it would not discover my 5GHz router signal.

Review: I ordered these to install a baby gate in a tricky spot. These worked perfectly. They are little longer than the average baby gate spindle rod, making it a perfect fit for that tricky spot.  I also purchased some pressure pads for the wall to add some extra reinforcement. Before buying these I accidentally bought 10mm rods that were just way too big to fit in the holes, so I had to return them. These 8mm however were a perfect fit. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a baby gate spindle in the 8mm size. Almost forgot to mention, they shipped really fast too.",1

The threaded rod, which allows both pivoting and height adjustment, was quite crooked on one of my seats. Also, the threaded tubing on one of the frames, which accepts that threaded rod, was welded in place very crookedly; not at all square. As a result of these defects, the seat was tilted more than 20 degrees relative to the floor.

That is, if he can stop him from killing his sister!<br />I won’t tell you more than that because it’s a great story and I think you’ll really enjoy not knowing every detail before you start. You’ll quickly find yourself absorbed in the story and addicted to it. I definitely recommend this one and love that it’s a 23 book series.",1

Review: These really impressed me. They were easy to program since they could be programmed while not plugged in. The instructions suggested they be plugged in for a short while to charge their internal batteries but there was sufficient charge when they arrived. The most useful capability was the ability to set a precise time so that the lights on various circuits came on at least within a minute of each other. You can't do that with the mechanical timer wheels. The price was right. Only used for a month and then stored so we'll see if they work next season.",1

Using your four main buttons on the PSP you tie together strings of rhythmic beats while the little Patapons keep the beat and repeat everything you hit.  Each beat has it's own command that tells the warriors whether to attack, defend, move forward or start a special chant.  Successfully completing a certain number of rhythms in a row will result in frenzy mode which makes the little guys attacks much faster.  This game even comes with a great story line that is pretty easy to follow.<br />  While fighting you'll even be able to pickup upgrades which will apply to certain warriors to help you progress in the game like armor, weapons new drums, food and materials for crafting new warriors",1
"Title: What happened???
Review: These used to be so good, and were my go to for inexpensive rose Turkish delight. This last bag though? Awful. Now they’re all individually wrapped and they were soooo dry and just crumbly, and crunchy even. The taste was a bit off, and I really felt like I should have contested things with Amazon, but I went ahead and ate them anyhow. Then I found a different brand to buy in the future. I’ll gladly come back to these if they work out the kinks, but I really don’t like the individual wrapping for them, so I guess I don’t see that happening anytime soon.",0
"Title: Great workout.
Review: I love this game.  I find it to be more engaging than the original Your Shape, more fun than Biggest Loser and overall better than EA Sports Active 2.  That said, there is no real ""program"" to follow, so I find myself doing a lot of fun things like playing ""wall breaker"", occasionally doing the boot camp workouts and occasionally doing the kickboxing or other cardio workouts.  The workouts are very varied; the tracking is pretty good, and the workout is very very intense if you set your fitness level at the highest level (don't do this unless you are indeed very fit, otherwise it'll probably kill you).",1
"Title: CHEAP PLASTIC MOUNT; GREAT Visibility & Brightness
Review: Great product! I love this light. Super bright for the price and has three light modes; bright, less bright, and flicker modes.<br /><br />I used this for nighttime riding on my dirt bike in the woods and also used for my street bike when biking throughout the city at night. This thing was great and lasted for multiple house. Recharge can be done on the go with a battery pack and micro usb cable running from your backpack to the light, allowing you to ride for even longer.<br /><br />I HAD to give this item a 1 Star as the bracket (100% plastic) broke after two weeks. I had to unscrew the light from the bracket and will continue to use as a basic flashlight.<br /><br />I am going to look at other options for a sturdier light with mount, but",0
"Title: Excellent taste, viscosity and freezes well
Review: I normally do not purchase a six pack of size 10 cans of processed nacho cheese sauce but when I saw this Rosarita brand case at a great price, I jumped on it.  I mean, let's face it, we are going nowhere these days where we could even consider purchasing from a concession stand and we are eating things that we usually do not eat, just to experience some variety.  Being fans of potatoes in any shape, color or recipe, my first thought as I awaited the package arrival was immediately baking potatoes and topping them with the nacho cheese sauce as a baseline.  Nothing else, just the potatoes and sauce.  Yummy!  Then we added things like green onion tops, garbanzo beans. toasted nuts, candied jalapenos, potato chip crumbles, well you get the id",1
"Title: Beautiful Display
Review: It's light weight and comes in a really nice case for transporting and storage. The screen is ample in size and gives a nice, clear picture. You can play DVD's or CD's on it. The sound system is excellent. The layout is simple and it is easy to operate. The directions manual leaves much to be desired, but with a little investigating, and you will be able to operate it in no time. The whole machine casing is made of plastic and is pretty solid. If I were to change anything, I'd make the door to the DVD/CD deck heavier; you'll just have to treat it with care when using. Otherwise, for the price, this is a very good buy.",1
"Title: Fun, silliness and excitement!
Review: This is a blast! It is, perhaps,a little highly strung. Frequently the 1st piece down ends the game!<br />But its fun - lots of screams and giggles ad the pile eventually gets higher<br />I love that it doesn't need batteries!<br />I love that the game is so simple, anyone can play it<br />I don't like that some of the pieces really do &#34;fire&#34; too easily (putting an overly sensitive one down, alone, very gently will cause it to launch)<br />I love that three minutes into this, all the cell phones were in pockets, and all focus was on the game.",1
"Title: As An Avid Student of History, All I could Say Was WOW!
Review: I have collected history books for many years.  I have been an avid student of history since I was quite small- collecting books from the 1800's and even 1700's if I could find anything (which I once did but it got lost).<br /><br />Anyway, I would normally not do this, but I saw this DVD and was so amazed that I sat with my mouth open much of the time.  Never have I seen so much valuable information gathered in one place about the REAL history of the US and Black America that is not twisted to manipulate the viewer.<br /><br />What we saw in this DVD literally changed our lives in a positive way.  If I had the ability I would purchase tons of these to distribute to students throughout the US of all races to give hope and pride back to us a",1
"Title: Disgracefully thin
Review: These bully sticks used to be the ""best"".  I always buy the jumbo odor-free 12-inch.  Since Covid, they are consistently and substantially smaller.  I just purchased yet another bag that I would consider thinner than their actual ""thin bully sticks"".  ALL other brands are exactly the same - trust me because I have tried them all and I buy them frequently.  I'd like to see their rating dropped in the same way they are now (post-Covid) misrepresenting their product.  It's fraudulent really...<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Since I need bully sticks frequently for my dogs and I'm paying a very high price and not getting what I paid for, I did try purchasing the 12-inch odor-free jumbo bully sticks from the actual vendor website.  It took over a week t",0
"Title: Just like LymDyp for mites/mange on cats & dogs! Great stuff.
Review: LimePlus Dip is just like LymDyp which apparently is not made anymore. This stuff is stinky because of the sulphur, but it sure does work. Get the big size just to have it on hand because mites can hide in bedding, rugs, etc. and return until you kill all of them on all of your pets. Easy to dilute and don't rinse it off. It needs to hang around to kill off the mites. Your pet will have yellowish fur.<br /><br />I did not need to use an Elizabethan collar, but some say that you should to keep the pet from licking their fur.<br /><br />Great stuff, kills it all...fleas, mites, lice, ticks, etc.",1
"Title: nonsense waste of money
Review: This item is garbage and a waste of money. The puffy thick stickers are supposed to go onto a child's names?? How??? It was a ridiculous waste of money. The lip gloss pots were in flimsy plastic tray. My niece picked it out ... she's 6... next time I know not to buy this nonsense again. Don't waste your money on it. Wish I could give a negative 5 for the product itself.<br /><br />The seller was good though. It came on time without any problem. I appreciate that of course so 5 stars to the seller.",0
"Title: An expensive hunk of junk.
Review: Despite the fact that this is, clearly, aluminum, it’s intended purpose is to prevent climax for mail. I don’t know of any man alive that has parts down there small enough to be able to use this product. Additionally, you have to use a hex wrench to put it on and take it off, it does have screws that have the little sides to them where you could try to do it with your fingers, but, usually there’s lubricant involved that process and your fingers simply will not  grasp  it. This is a waste of money, don’t purchase this.",0
"Title: Wide, Won't last, Stretch Out!!!!
Review: At first these were fine, after a week I was getting concerned about how much these were stretching out, they are wide to begin with. Now after a month or so they are completely too big, not exaggerating too big, and  there's no back strap to help me stay in them. Also the rhinestone strip is peeling off one sandal. I paid a lot more for these at a local store, if I didn't feel bad already, I was really sick when I saw them here at nearly half price. I purchased a size 6, just like every other shoe in my closet. Worthless, can't wear them, waste of my money!",0
"Title: Does not stick to shower.
Review: The listing claims, ""Holds tight on all shower surfaces."" That is not true. It will not attach to my fiberglass shower stall. I bought this mirror because I don't want to mar my shower. The package includes a plastic disk with a peel and stick adhesive that can be glued to the shower, then the suction cup is supposed to attach to the disk.  I don't know if that would work or not because I don't want to permanently glue the disk to my shower. The suction cup might work if you have old fashioned shiny hard smooth ceramic tile, but is worthless in a modern shower.<br />When the first mirror I received wouldn't attach I returned it for a replacement. The replacement won't stick, either.",0
"Title: The set is fantastic for beginners in the world of fountain pens
Review: The set is fantastic for beginners in the world of fountain pens, especially for students. Light in the hand, perfect for small hands. The fountain pen has a short nib that has a smooth ink flow. The ballpoint pen matches the fountain pen exactly and is a good writer itself. The set comes with a pack of washable blue fountain pen ink and a blue refill for the ballpoint pen. The fantastic thing about the washable ink is, you can purchase an eradicator which erases the ink on one side and writes over it with the other side. Perfect for the finicky writer that does not like to scratch out any writing mistakes. In all, this is a great value for the set.",1

Review: Some were a bit harder than others. Maybe they were not that fresh. Idk. The grape flavor was a huge disappointment, hard and off tasting. The others, they were hardly okay. Not what I expected or quality I’m use to.<br />My 3 kids, who loves fruit snacks: my girls said they weren’t that bad. My son said they are gross. None of them wanted anymore.<br />Unlike other reviews, I did receive all 48, 8 of each flavor as shown.<br />Now what do I do with the rest…Halloween treats, other kids may like them, or trash?

"Title: My new daily driver
Review: This mouse is amazing. It's grippy, accurate, lightweight, has macro and color customizations, and  an ambidextrous design. I primarily use the mouse for fps gaming and web browsing. I've been playing Rainbow Six Siege with this mouse, and it's very precise and helpful for quick movements. I do feel as if I'm doing better while using it. The one thing that's taking me time to get used to is the additional buttons on the left and right hand size of the mouse (to use as a power user). The back and forth buttons most mice have, this has on both sides. This lets you use the other two as you please. The default is page up and page down, which is very convenient for web browsing.

"Title: Get ready for TONS of junk mail. Also magazine content crowded and uninteresting for kids.
Review: I ordered this subscription a few years ago and for over a year, I received TONS of junk mail as they gave out my mail address to other companies that sell kid related items.<br />Also, the magazine is poorly put together in a crowded and confusing manner so that even the kids were not entertained by the content.  They are missing out because this magazine had the potential of being something interesting, but falls way short!  And, it really irritated me that they gave away my address and I was bombarded with so much junk mail as a result of my having subscribed to this magazine.",0
"Title: One of the worst &quot;Fidelios&quot; ever
Review: Toscanini was a great conductor and a great Beethoven interpreter, but everything works against this &quot;Fidelio.&quot;  For one thing, this was a period when he was conducting everything much too fast.  For another, he omits all the spoken dialogue which compresses the opera even further.  The cast is also dreadful, with almost every singer miscast: Bampton's Leonore is thin and shrill, Peerce's Florestan relentlessly loud and beefy-sounding, Steber's Marzelline too heavy.  In addition, neither Bampton nor Peerce sing with any feeling or dramatic conviction.  And then there are the Studio 8-H sonics, so dry and boxy that every note sounds like a thump on the head.<br />Try to find the legendary 1941 Met broadcast conducted by Bruno Walte",0
"Title: Not even close to ""heavy duty""
Review: Heavy duty? Seriously?! I cut through one, one-inch thick piece of galvanized pipe letting the machine do the work (in other words not pushing hard) and it went roughly 3/4 of the way through before it started throwing significantly less sparks and cutting massively slower. After two pipes it made a 1/8&#34; dent in a third and refused to do anything more so I had to replace the wheel. Burned through the whole 4-pack on a single job before replacing with another brand that lasted five or six times as long. I like my DeWalt cut-off machine, but these wheels are awful.",0
"Title: Been 2+ years with Kp with 0 (zero) problems
Review: Installed Kp internet security 2015 on Windows 7 laptop without any problems and no need to uninstall 2014 KP first.  The new version's interface is more sophisticated than previous with some time saving additions. Reviewing and changing defaults in Settings is quick and easy. Re its abilities to keep malware off my machine and preserve my privacy, I give it 5 stars. My older Intel Core 2 machine continues to run very fast suggesting  good Kp efficiency. So with a tweaked  Windows 7 for performance, it's about 90 seconds from hitting the power on button to what appears full OS and Kp functioning. And, Kp 2015's low amazon pricing is competitive vs other retailers' and the other top rated internet suites.. I paid ~$26 with  actual faster tha",1
"Title: It’s really not at all what is advertised in the merchant’s listing so be forewarned.
Review: I returned this after one day. It really is not at all as advertised. It is NOT “3D” whatsoever, nor can you “program it” because all it can do is “pulse” side to side rather strongly and not really “vibrate” like the platforms I’ve used at gyms or at my chiropractor. As a result, it is very violent and forceful. You can only control the level of violence from short violent bursts of motion to one’s that can injure yourself so use caution. The levels of “pulse” are not very gradual, either... just rather abrupt modules. The time can also be adjusted... but that is all. Another major consideration is that this unit is NOT “UL” certified, so I was concerned about a potential overheating and fire danger. I’d suggest looking elsewhere.",0
"Title: Great idea, poor implementation
Review: This product did not work as advertised. The IP address for the wireless device is the same as my router, which caused a problem upon setup because the utility would try to communicate with the router and not the extender. After talking to tech support, I was able to set things up through a work around. Things were smooth for a couple of weeks but then I started having connection problems due to the same IP conflict. The problems kept growing and now reached the point of dysfunction. Here are my gripes:<br />- The IP conflict issue is simply poor execution. This shouldn't be hard to foresee and a simple fix should be easy to provide.<br />- Tech support is awful. My latest call to them were a waste of time. I couldn't understand what the te",0
"Title: Superb guitar music to soothe the soul
Review: This collection of guitar music from William Elwood and another artist are so soothing! I purchased it because I've had other CDs by William Ellwood and enjoyed them very much. While each piece is different, they've been chosen to blend very well, one after the other. (There's nothing more jarring when listening to a CD than to have some crashing music after a gentle piece!) I play this music when I'm drawing or painting and it is great to help me let go of stress and get into the beauty of color and design. I think it'd also be good during meditation (which art is for me.)",1

Review: So I would like to start off saying that very, very rarely do I leave anything under three stars, even if it had grammatical errors and issues.  But this book?  Wow this thing was horrible.  All the darkness and everything doesn’t affect this rating at all, trust me I’ve read way darker.  No it’s all the horrible loop holes, severe time jumps and the author expecting you to know what has happened in the past. They just threw the characters in with very little depth and damn they suck. This was a very poorly written book with so many frustrating struggles and qualities that I found myself struggling so bad to read it and even skimming and skipping through the pages.  Save yourself time and just skip.",0
"Title: Did not work despite going through all hoops of tech support. Worst Amazon purchase ever. Filament jam purgatory.
Review: It was exciting to receive the printer and set it up. I knew in advance from friends with all kinds of different 3D printers that there was going to be a lot of fiddling. So I followed the manual and found the calibration was not right so I recalibrated and lo and behold, I was able to print out two objects that I had designed in the amazing SketchUp 2015 modeling package. But then it stopped working. It would lay down the filament that it always does on the side of the platform but then when it came to printing the object, the print head would go all over the platform but leave no trace of filament. This despite multiple attempts at calibration, nozzle cleaning, filament loading/unloading and every other debugging maneuver found in the man",0
"Title: Good grill rack. Arrived as advertised.
Review: I have a small grill that gets too hot even at the lowest setting and burns things easy. I needed an elevated warming rack to cook foil wrapped vegetables, tater tots in foil, and other things. Its high enough to grill meats below it and reach under with tongs and a spatula. I installed it in a couple seconds. It adjusts easy to size, and stays in place just fine when the lower legs are inserted into the lower grate. The legs sit on top of those metal burner covers below the grate. Its high enough I can cook tots wrapped in foil, then open the foil to crisp on this rack. I like this rack, and I can keep my cheap grill.",1

Review: Not effective. I’m allergic to mold bc of some exposure and I struggle with contact allergies from it. I was hopeful that this would work or be an single solution in helping to remove it or lint etc that it carries on... Mold is everywhere so it’s been hard to deal with and so far, oxi-clean and detergent work better. It worked a little better than allersearch tho for those who want to try it.

"Title: All You Need To Upgrade
Review: Most compressors don't include the hose, and the one we got a steal on definitely didn't but there was an accompanied branded hose on a great deal too, so we just grabbed that, made sense at the time.  However, that hose worked fine, it kinked a lot. Also, on some applications wasn't nearly long enough.  So we grabbed this and another hose, by a different color and length so we didn't have to play guessing games to remember which hose was how long.  For this price, I have to say, it was such a decent deal that I was kinda skeptical, much to our surprise, actually a perfect upgrade.  Very maneuverable, but also sturdy, kept in the garage during very cold weather, no cracking and I love all the adapters it came with.  I highly recommend this ",1

Review: Every time, something wrong. Bought new at HP, and had high hopes. The issue is always different. Issues with print heads, issues with connectivity, software corruption. And the monthly pay plan for ink... really? The only reason this makes sense is because this printer drinks black like a trucker and coffee. The actual print quality is  marginal at best, once you get it working. After a year, I am underwhelmed and disappointed. I bought it because it was attractive looking, and on paper - does everything I want. Only... not really.",0

Review: This has to be my favorite album of all times. Even though there are a wide variety of sounds on this album, from soothing to energetic, I can't think of a bad track. I had to pay to download this since it seems you can't buy it new anymore. It's beyond me why they don't re-issue this. It's an album that's a must hear in my opinion. This was the best album The Creatures released, the other albums such as Anima Animus have great tracks too, but this is the most consistantly great album. If you can get hold of a copy, buy it you won't be disappointed.",1

Review: I don't know how the product works, but the company is impossible to work with. They don't care about customers, and this is the last thing from Black and Decker that I ever waste my money on. This chainsaw either came without instructions, or they were inadvertently thrown away. I figured it was no problem, I'd get them from Black and Decker's website. Uh-uh. Not there. I e-mailed them and asked to get the instructions. They sent me a link--to a white, blank screen. I e-mailed them again and told them that a blank, white screen doesn't do me any good.

One of these colors match what some part of any outfit I have put on.<br /><br />I love this collection. Sometimes I pick a watch first then go find something to wear that matches one of these cool watch colors. The only numbers are the 12 & the 6, but golden bits indicate where the other numbers would be. The zirconia on the sides of the watch design dress them up from plain to classier.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like was that while the time was accurate, all ten watches were running, wearing out the battery.

For Mothers Day and birthdays, he always finds a car with a toilet on the cover, or animals going to the bathroom - something non-sentimental.<br /><br />So, this is a bit irreverent and non-motherly to send to him.<br /><br />Turnabout is fair play kind of thing.  It's made from a well-managed forest which sounds good.  It's a simple card, but the message says it all.  You don't need decoration to distract from the humorous message.

Review: Update September 2: hose started leaking at the source where it is screwed on at the dehumidifier.  I’ll try a new washer but cannot give this any positive rating at this time<br /><br />The “hose” is just cheap plastic tubing.  In no way would I have bought this from a store.

After spending a few nights sleeping in my arms in bed with my husband and I, I began looking for a better solution without spending a fortune. This has fit the bill for us! He is sleeping fine and my husband feels a lot more comfortable that he is slightly safer. I like that it is easy to reach in and lay a hand on him to soothe him. I'm not sure how long we will be able to sleep in it, but I'm truly hoping it will be a temporary solution and we can continue to try and get him to sleep in his pack and play again.",1

I wanted something that the two big ones could possible lay on together or at least three of them lay on. As soon as it arrived, I put a fitted sheet on it. They Doberman and the smaller two loved it at once. Honestly, I haven't really noticed if it makes a noise or not when they get on it. But when I got on it, it does go down and pop up in one spot. But I am a a grown adult. So that is to be expected. According to other reviews, I probably would not use this for a baby. My dogs seem to like this.",1

Review: I really wanted to like this natural, gentle face wash. With fantastic ingredients like almond oil, green tea, vitamin E, and aloe vera, I expected it to be the healthiest cleanser ever. But after two weeks, my face looks like a pizza.<br />Perhaps it was too moisturizing for my skin. Although I have been told my skin could use a little more moisture, this might have been too intense - even though it's supposed to be gentle enough for sensitive skin. I used it every morning for two weeks (with my usual toner), and by the end of the first week my face had completely broken out. I used it for an additional week so my skin might become acclimated, but it only got worse. Blackheads, underground zits, and red bumps all across my forehead. Very d",0

He and Blair were high school sweethearts that couldn’t make it work but he’s totally surprised when she shows up to tell him their divorce wasn’t finalized. But their attraction is still there and both have grown up.

Review: I really like my new little lamp. I wanted something bright for night time reading/seeing next to my sofa. I went for a lamp with a cord because I don't want to mess with charging all the time.

Review: First, bought to take down 3 tree stumps that have destroyed 2 lawn mowers thanks to my lack of attention.<br /><br />I have both Dewalt & Ryobi 4.5"" elec angle grinders.<br /><br />Most 4.5"" grinders are suited for 22mm or 7/8"" bore type wheels. The 16mm grinder shaft, it will fit, but you have to take the backing (washer) off to ""register"" on the shoulder. The outer diameter of most spanner nuts will not fit inside this wheel to tighten down though. Small OD flat washer and a 5/8-11 jam nylock may do it? Will try this later.<br /><br />Was not going to modify the grinder nuts, so I opted to toss this to the side, and purchased ($60.00) a 114mm x 7/8"" bore wheel to do the job intended.",0
"Title: Deliberate unadulterated garbage
Review: This show is horrible opening scene woman is raped in order to join the ""Boys CLub"" just another disgusting immoral piece of evil indoctrination. Casting couch for evil villainous super heroes idolized like the false gods they are. Also filled with PC BS leftist jargon. I was really uncomfortable at the effort the writers went to obliterating CHristianity... Seriously so tired of wicked intentions pushed on the public sexual content is bizarre and I guess normal for today. I do not recommend this dark waste of time series. Just more rape, sex, murder, filth, foul language, lies and gore. Hollywood's immorality at the cost of our nation is... anti everything good.",0
"Title: Sorry, but I don't get it....
Review: While I can't tell you in such a beautiful or complex way that this CD stinks, I can certainly tell you in simple terms... This is one of the biggest tops to flops that I've heard in some time. Not that the Remedy CD was exceptional in my opinion, but it was good... There is no song on this CD that can match &quot;Red Alert&quot;... Also missing is the Reggae influenced tracks... This is a total mix-and-match beats paradise. The music is highly confusing. The blends of sounds just don't match. And I was left with a strange look on my face after listening to it. The only track that I can say that I fully liked was &quot;Just one kiss&quot;. Other than that, I can throw this CD away. In what is seen by a creative CD by many, I guess I'm in th",0
"Title: Batteries leaked?!??
Review: I ended up not needing these batteries immediately, so after they were received, I left them in the original packaging in which they were shipped. I opened the box today to unpack them and put them away for future use, at which time I was horrified to discover that the batteries apparently leaked?! There was some sort of yellowish moisture around the outside envelope (that was inside the shipping box), and it was coming from the batteries – all still wrapped in their original blister pack. I'm honestly not even sure how I'm supposed to dispose of these, but I do feel fairly certain that this isn't something that should have occurred.",0

Review: I was pretty much forced to purchase this by FOSCAM who said I needed this because their camera would not work unless they were within 5 feet of the router. I bought this and even though it did nothing for the issues I was having with the Foscams, it just did not work. The signal kept dropping and when I called Netgear support they were rude and dismissing.<br />It was not worth anymore time and effort spend so it ended up in the junk drawer the very day it arrived.<br />There &#34;may&#34; be other wifi extenders that work but I would not spend any time or money on this one",0
"Title: Pretty Lame
Review: The writer is decent but in this particular novel, he didn't seem much like he cared about it. This novel is based in South Carolina about a family that has never met their father's relatives but something causes them to leave their home in Connecticut (where the father's life has been planted for at least twenty years & his wife, plus 2 children know of nowhere else to call home) They arrive, meet the relatives, things happen & even more things happen but the novel just lacks any depth. The only interesting 1 is the killer. The characters are one dimensional...I will tell you that it does read like a bad-horror-flick.",0
"Title: Best earl grey tea
Review: I love Rishi Earl Grey. It's hands down the best earl grey I've ever had. I also loved the old packaging in the tins. But since the company switched to the paper packaging, I saved the last tin I had, and started buying I these one pound packages and I fill the tin as needed. I store this one pound package in a large ziploc bag in the cabinet (because tea should not be stored on the refrigerator or freezer.) these one pound packages are ounce for ounce a better deal than buying the tins previously, and it is the same great tea inside.",1
"Title: Rip Off
Review: Just when you thought this series couldn't get any worse along comes Raspberry Danish Murder. You will be led on throughout an entire book only to have the last page leave you hanging yet again in the most ridiculous of all scenarios.  I don't see Ross being such a jerk as previously he was presented as a very nice guy all along.  Why would he do such a cruel thing to Hannah and then leave his life savings to her with absolutely no explanation?  Clearly, this author is taking advantage of her readers. I'm disappointed that the author chose to go this route with all these characters that were once so interesting.  At this point, I don't even care about her, her fat cat, her stubborn and ridiculous refusal to carry a cell phone when her life ",0
"Title: Great, convenient, tasty product.
Review: Very happy with this find.<br />When I look for coffee making devices, my most important question: how much will it cost me when I (inevitably) break the carafe? The answer in this case is: 9 bucks for 4 carafes at the big W.  However, the 1x coffee it makes is rich and delicious.  Also, I have been using espresso grounds, which is what I had in the house, and the tube does allow lots of those small particles thur.  I still use it because the coffee is awesome, but I am careful not to shake or otherwise disturb the tube as I am lifting it out.<br /><br />I already have devices for making flavored water, but if I didn't, I would buy another tube for that.",1
"Title: Not the same quality as in previous years
Review: I was originally given this blanket set as a gift two years ago.  I purchased a second set a few weeks ago because we loved them so much!  This new set is not the same as the previous blankets and is a cheap knock off.  Instead of high-quality, ultra-soft cotton muslin swaddling blankets I received scratchy muslin fabric that is smaller in size and much lower in quality.<br />A high-quality swaddling blanket should be soft so it doesn't irritate baby's skin, breathable and light so baby doesn't overheat, have a bit of stretch so baby can move a wee bit, and be large enough to wrap and tuck snuggly around baby. There are many excellent Summer brand swaddling blankets out there - but this particular listing is not the one you want!",0
"Title: Windows 7 Upgrade
Review: I purchased two of these upgrade products.  One was installed on a Dell notebook updating Windows Vista.  Absolutely no problem at all.  The second was installed on Dell off-lease desktop computer replacing an XP custom built computer that was beginning to give me problems.  Since upgrading an XP operating system required a clean install I did it all at once.  Installation of the Windows 7 operating system upgrade went without incident - just had to put my old Windows XP system diskette into the drive for the upgrade to ""see"" it and away it went.  Very satisfied with the results and am now contemplating purchase of another Windows 7 upgrade for my sole remaining Dell XP machine.....no fun reinstalling all the software but it is worth it.  W",1
"Title: great little light, easy to use, very versatile, tent, car or home use
Review: I collect flashlights and lanterns so naturally, I had to see this.  Last winter, here in Texas when it got below zero ( which is rare ) we had rolling blackouts.  Since I have many lights our house was never dark.  This little light would have been great for that time.<br /><br />This plugs into a USB power supply ( which most of us have ) I even have flashlights that can power this thing.  Most newer cars also have USB plugs in them.  This light can be used in many places.  I think a tent would be an excellent place to use this.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  It also puts out a good amount of light.<br /><br />I am pleased with this light and happy to have it.  For the money, how can you go wrong?",1
"Title: Genuine Design is trash
Review: Whoever designed this shelf is an idiot. If you look at the left and right edges, you'll notice that 100% of the weight on this shelf is held by 2 thin chunks of plastic (the hooks) that are MAYBE 5mm x 2mm at their thinnest point.<br /><br />This shelf, being the only asymmetrical one in your refridgerator, keeps breaking because somehow the right side ends up bearing more than its fair share of that load, and is EASILY snapped.<br /><br />You can keep buying replacements, genuine or otherwise...<br /><br />Or you could just support the shelf with gorilla tape underneath and over where your partial remaining clip(s) are. And then you'll likely replace that gorilla tape LESS.",0

As stated in the product description these are screw-free sunglasses. While  that usually causes design flaws, none could be found in these stylish and unique frames (see attached photos for screw free nose pads and temples) . I love the light weight, the high-low detail on the corners of the lenses and the subtle gradient lenses.<br /><br />I have a round face that makes finding sunglasses a tad difficult, but the style of these would look great on any face sha",1
"Title: Excellent setup, solder-free installation
Review: Solder free was the main draw for me.  The listing on Amazon doesn't do a great job of explaining it, but the EMG website does.  The installation is solder-free assuming you can salvage the ground wire from y our existing guitar.<br /><br />I am not good with a soldering gun.  I dropped this into a Mighty Mite Strat kit that I built and it sounds phenomenal.  Still have to ground it (ground wire not incldued) and that requires soldering a wire to the tremolo claw if you're building a kit (or just not de-soldering the wire if you have a full guitar already), but then the pick guard connects everything using a series of screw-down connectors for the pickup signal/ground and volume/tone pots.  Come for the easy installation, stay for the tone.",1
"Title: Very basic but works very well
Review: This little razor is super simple but works surprisingly very well.  I call it an ""old school"" electric razor with the two little rows of razors.  Kind what you see in the older movies.<br /><br />I'm not bald so I don't know how well it works on bald heads, but it does work on your face too!  It's pretty easy to clean and it charges really easily too.<br /><br />It has a simple on/off button and that's really all you need.  Charger is included.<br /><br />For a super low price it does the job.  Could be used as a little travel razor or you could even leave it in your car or at work in case you forget to shave and need to do a touch up before a meeting or something.",1

"Title: Excellent double album set
Review: Both albums in this set share Earl Hines on piano and Benny Carter on trumpet (and also on alto sax on the first fifteen tracks), as well as Leroy Vinnegar on bass and Shelly Manne on drums. The gems are the tracks featuring Barbara Dane,which start at track 16 despite that one being credited to Carter. In fact, the first fifteen tracks are co-led by Earl Hines and Benny Carter, and is the album titled Swingin' The '20s that was recorded for the Contemporary label. The Barbara Dane album is titled  Livin' with the Blues that was recorded for the Dot label, and features the Earl Hines Orchestra backing her.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples and you will notice that the music has a seamlessquality to it. Of course, with both Hines and ",1

Review: Dick Farney is one of the finest performers that Bossa Nova  ever had. Farney's  exquisite phrasing and intimate reading takes you to the Rio De Janeiro myth and invites you to sit down  have a beer or a great chat while watching women passing by, this in fact the Bossa Nova idea.  Tereza Da praia and Copacabana are two of his greatest interpretations. Once again His sophisticated voice turned  these simple  songs into classics.

"Title: Nice puzzle set!
Review: My son and I are going to be making all of these over the next few days.  We're both hooked.  So far I've colored most of the VW Beetle and he's working on the T-Rex.  These are also DOUBLE SIDED so you can essentially take them apart and completely change their design whenever you're bored.  Looking really cool!<br /><br />Markers are pretty typical, but they do the job.  None were dried out or anything.  Will be supplementing with others, though, for more colors.  Haha<br /><br />Pieces are easy enough to pop out for a kid, but I'm taking my time and being careful with my Beetle.  If you want the nicest edges possible, use an hobby blade to release them from the page.  Pieces seem to go together very nicely, but again I've only done about",1

Review: I had thought that this would be good for a very small drink of water or juice, and the picture looks very cute.  Not so in real life. It is plastic, and much of the metal paint had been scratched off by the time I got the package, even though the box was intact.  This bottle is very small and hold no more than 4 oz of your preferred beverage, which is too small for juice or water (for me). Besides, it just looks cheap and tacky.  If the bottle looked half as cute as it does in the picture, I could put it on my dresser.  As it is, I can see no use for this.  And if I give it away, I will have insulted someone in a big way.

"Title: Don’t waste your time
Review: So I have a ton of smart devices. The one thing I didn’t have was a smart thermostat. I have a heat pump and over 3 degree fluctuations in t-stat settings will turn on auxiliary heat and it defeats the purpose of having a heat pump for energy savings.<br />That being said I decided to order and try THIS one.<br />I will say that wiring and setup was really easy. The directions were easy to read and easy to follow. Once setup it seemed to perform as designed. After the WiFi setup it (the t-stat) has a registration screen pop up with a QR code and a four digit code. I scanned the QR and it wouldn’t connect and register. I tried several times and it wouldn’t register. I noticed on the t-stat screen it said “register from the app”.<br />Then I ",0

Review: These bras are very comfortable.  I hardly notice I am wearing them.  The band under my breast is soft and, so far, hasn't started to dig in.  The shoulder straps are wide and soft and they stay put (I feel crazy when my bra straps start slipping off)<br /><br />My only complaint is that they don't provide very much support.  I am wearing them around the house, doing some light housework, watching tv, reading, but I can't imagine going for a walk or even across the street to pick up some milk in these bras.

First, it isn't just a normal round shape but instead, it's oval and is thicker towards the back of the cup while it is thinner towards the front which totally helps when pouring the resin and even mixing the resin.

Review: Fundamental problem: there's a sticker on the bottom of the mouse that grabs a little bit, so for office work maybe OK. But for gaming, awful! The sticker on the bottom makes moving it across mouse pads or flat surfaces spotty/sluggish, so it catches a little bit sometimes. If you're going to put a sticker on the bottom of a mouse as a branding effort, make sure the rest of the mouse's surface extends further so the sticker isn't catching on things.

The deckle scissors in this set (and I guess all the rest of the scissors) are so dull and so cheaply made as to be useless.

"Title: Makes me laugh every time I think about it.
Review: I am the first to admit that I am a little corny, which explains why I like this Byairls’ pet tag so much.  When I read it for the first time, I literally laughed out loud at the sentence on the front (“I’m an ** and ran away”). We are a two dog household, but I selected Joey, our 18-month-old rescue, to wear this witty tag even though he is chipped. Between the two, he is more likely to escape than my 13-year-old, diabetic and blind pooch. So while I honestly don’t think he would ever wonder off, at least I know this tag will help bring him home, especially after I have my phone number engraved on the back. You could also add another tag with your personal information. The stainless steel tag is well made and the perfect size (about the si",1
"Title: One of my faves!
Review: I absolutely love this summer striped dress. It has an attached belt that ties in the front along with two front pockets. The fit is very flattering. When you tie the dress on the front, you get a bit of a cinched look that accents your waist. The dress is extremely comfortable. You can wear this dress casually with some cute sandals or dress it up with a pair of heels. It is amazingly comfortable and will be great to wear shopping, to dinner, etc.<br /><br />This fits true to size. I normally wear a small or medium in dresses and this medium was a perfect fit. However, if you are wanting address to be loose fitting, I recommend sizing up one size.<br /><br />See my pictures for details. Overall, I highly recommend this dress. Thank you for",1
"Title: DESIGN FLAW
Review: After only 11 months of using our dishwasher we had to replace the pump due to breakage of the small fanlike part connected to the shaft on the outside of the pump. Now again after only two months of use this same part has failed again.  This appears to be a design flaw since the part does not hold up during normal use.  We always rinse our dishes so the cause should not be because of food debris.  We really hesitate spending the time and money to replace the part again when it has a history of failure.  We have contacted Whirlpool to report this apparent design flaw",0
"Title: Worth it for the Black Currant alone
Review: My taste reference: strong coffee, red wine, Old Spice deodorant.<br /><br />I bought this because I was too lazy to drive to Walmart but I was pleasantly surprised with what I got.<br /><br />Notes on each scent:<br />Espresso: Doesn't compare to the real thing: too nutty. Reminds me more of a bakery than a cafe. Still good though.<br /><br />Caramel: Artificial smelling, more candle than candy. Still gives some decent Thanksgiving/Christmas vibes.<br /><br />Raspberry & Cinnamon: Heavier on the cinnamon. Spicy. Reminds me of a craft store aisle where the wreaths are kept. Not a fan.<br /><br />Black Currant: Sharp and sweet. Nectar-ripe flowers in spring rain. Not overwhelming and in-your-face, but subtle. I've had this running for two da",1
"Title: This is a W I D E angle lens
Review: This is a wide lens. On my Sony a6300 I wanted to see how wide it can get. I put it on my counter top and put a tape measure in front of it at its minimal focus distance. It is able to view over 12 inches wide. The two photos are at f/2.8 and f/22. These photos came right out of the camera with no editing. The lens hood does not show up as vignetting unless the hood is rotated. The darkness at the bottom of the photos is from the camera body blocking the kitchen light. The lens hood can be removed, but be careful to not unscrew the front cover of the lens that is holding the outer lens in place. The other thing to look out for is your hands. The lens is so wide that you can find your hands getting in the shot if you don't keep your fingers ",1
"Title: Bizarre angular animation flavor du jour ruins another classic
Review: Not to say the original series had good animation - far from it - but it had a charm, intelligence, and pacing this dismal knockoff does not. Using the latest trending freaky angular animation that became passe 15 years ago, something studio execs seem to think is still hot (including Dreamworks here, and Disney Channel on the latest Mickey garbage), this reboot lacks all the sophisticated and timely goofiness of the Jay Ward creation. This is destined for the same dismal scrap heap as all those Twilight Zone rehashes, finally settling with a thud next to other lost opportunities, like the Thunderbirds movie, the Man from UNCLE remake, and Mario Bros.",0
"Title: Don't bother, the sound quality is terrible and little information is provided!
Review: I bought this CD because my parents had the original 78 version.  I played it many times as a kid, and the sound quality was a lot better on the shellac records.  With all the technology available, Kipepeo Publishing could have made the transfer at least as good as the original.  And to top it all off, there is no information provided other than the names of the songs and a replica of the album cover.  There's nothing to tell you that it was a studio recording with (variously) Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Jack and Charlie Teagarden, Glenn Miller, Jimmy Dorsey, and Babe Russin.  Jack Teagarden sings on ""The Sheik of Araby.""",0
"Title: Cozy!
Review: I'm loving this cozy pullover Vera Bradley! I didn't think I would actually be wearing it this soon, as it's not even Thanksgiving yet and I live in Georgia, but due to Global Warming, it was in the low 30's last night. I was thankful this arrived! It's even better than I expected! I ordered the 3X size because of my previous experience with VB clothing. I'm currently an 18/20 or 2X, but when I have ordered anything from VB with long sleeves, I have found them to be too tight in the shoulders. This fits loose (but not baggy) and isn't tight at all. I even wore this over another shirt without any difficulties. It's very soft. I find myself ""petting"" it. I love the pockets. They are actually connected so it's a kangaroo style pocket. It kept ",1

"Title: Nope
Review: If I didn't already remove one of the huge annoying logo labels I'd return it.  First of all-  The larger strap is useless.  It's a strange size that is much to large for an ankle or arm, yet too small for a waist.  I have a 25 inch waist and this fit very tightly across my waist (not that the waist would be all that convenient a place anyway, but I couldn't think of where else to use this).  The smaller strap is more reasonable and can be used on the wrist or ankle, but the strap covers the part of the wire that attaches to it, so everytime you want to set yourself free from the wire you have unstick the velcro first and then do it-  Just an extra step that gets annoying really quickly.<br /><br />I think this was just a huge waste of mone",0
"Title: Great for helping figure out plumbing issues
Review: I have my own house which means not only do I have my regular day job but I'm also a plumber/electrician/general handyman also, so I got this to specifically help with some plumbing issues I've been having.  TO charge it you charge the handle via USB C then you screw the camera in.  The charge took no time at all so that's a plus.  The handle has a flashlight so if you are working in dark places you can actually see and the snake has its own light on it which you can control from the handle also.  You do have to download an app but they give you a card with a QR code and an ads-free code so you don't have to have ads on the app, getting these on my android was super easy.  The cradle for your phone is nice as I have had other endos that jus",1
"Title: Should have been no-hit wonders
Review: I heard the song &quot;Steal My Sunshine&quot; on the radio a few days ago, and it reminded me of what utter rubbish this band put out - small wonder, then, that this album now appears in bargain bins everywhere.<br />Len's debut album, You Can't Stop The Bum Rush, is not worth picking up unless you find the concept of a bunch of people from the Great White North rapping in high-pitched whiny-voiced appealing - everyone else need not apply.  &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot; is a cheesy bubblegum song with an irritating &quot;doo-da-doo-doo&quot; hook that's not helped by the presence of Poison's CC Deville.  &quot;Steal My Sunshine&quot; rides a looped sample of &quot;More, More, More&quot; (Andrea True Connection) throughout its duration and wr",0
"Title: Rude SurpriseRead ingredient labels very carefully and watch for changes over time, too!
Review: Read ingredients labels carefully and watch for changes over time, too. This product contains more preservatives and chemicals than Pampers Baby Fresh Sensitive Wipes. How sad that this product is marketed to new parents who are trying to do the so-called BEST for their new babies. These wipes cost twice as much and are anything but safe for tender skin. The wipes were for me, a grandmother's age, after allergy testing positive for 6 preservatives and being told Pampers Baby Fresh Sensitive Wipes were on a &#34;do not use&#34; list per my dermatologist. He has since updated his list after I shared the ingredients of both these products with him. Yes, Baby Fresh Sensitive Wipes improved the ingredients during the past year and they are NOT b",0
"Title: New design; crap quality
Review: We have been getting these for a while and were happy with it but recently it looks like the design has changed and these compare terribly with the original which were very absorbent. These diapers don’t work well after the baby pees in them - they get bunched up horribly with clumps and are uncomfortable for the baby. Very unhappy.<br />Also, these CANNOT be returned so I’ve ended up with new designed (probably at a cheaper facility to meet the huge diaper demand during this CORONA crisis) crappy (pun intended) diapers.",0

Review: I love this case.  I had an Otterbox for a couple months.  Really durable, but too hard to push the buttons because I have some arthritis in my thumb and wrists.  This case maks the buttons very accessible and operational for me.  It is lighter weight in appearance and way less bulky.  It is crystal clear, shows off my lovely iPhone 8 plus, and has nice bumpered corners.  It has all the nice design features (lip edge over the screen, fits tightly, nice cutouts, etc.) that I would look for in a case, and I am told my voice is more easily heard when I make a call.",1

Review: I bought this to replace the stopper in a bath/shower combo. It wouldn't stay in place in the drain with any of the different size rings that it comes with. When I finally did get it to stay for a while, it wouldn't allow enough water to flow through it during a shower. The chrome plated piece is plastic and seems like it would break in fairly short order - had I been able to get it to stay in place that is.<br /><br />Bottom line - it's a piece of plastic junk. Don't waste your money like I did.",0

Review: This review is addressed to Samsung; Dear Samsung,<br /><br />I purchased your Samsung refrigerator model no: RSG257AARS/XAA, back in Dec. 2013 when I bought my first home.<br /><br />While I am not customarily someone who uses ice in my drinks, there are certain beverages wherein I do use ice, such as with a soda or a cocktail. But for water and juices I do not require ice and as I rarely drink a soda or have a cocktail I can't say the ice maker on my unit has had much use considering I am a one person household.<br /><br />This little to no use of the icemaker is potentially why this problem with the ice maker/dispenser did not appear until 6 months later, in July 2014.<br /><br />I first noticed the problem when I dispensed ice and disco",0
"Title: Great Baby Walker!
Review: The Safety 1st Ready, Set, Walk DX Developmental Walker is an affordable and fun walker for babies.  I loved how easy it was to put together, there were no tools needed for assembly.  All the pieces snap together very easily and can be put together in five minutes or less.  This is mostly plastic and it is easy to clean all the areas where that the baby will have contact with. It comes with a tray that you snap into place and it has four interactive toys that snap into the tray. One toy is a big button that you need to insert two AAA batteries (Phillip screwdriver needed to open battery compartment and batteries not included). The button has an on/off switch that you can turn on/off and the baby shouldn't be able to turn on/off.  When the b",1
"Title: Stan Mikita should have stabbed this game in the snow.
Review: I remember getting this as a gift for a kid and trying very hard to play it. I tried to get my sister to play it. I tried to get my friends to play it. But after dying a few times, everyone would put the controller down without making eye contact.<br /><br />Here's how I got sucked back down this rabbit hole: I was cruising through a used video game store and saw this for $7! Then I had those terrible memories of how bad it was, but I thought I was just a kid and maybe didn't appreciate the simplistic gameplay when I had other choices with explosions and aliens. I had just got a Retron 2, so it seemed too good to be true. Also: WAYNE'S WORLD IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE. I figured it'd be good for a few laughs and maybe I'd even slog through and be",0

Review: Another rare entity to find in local grocery stores and I have little time to head down the the speciality shops: and here it is on Amazon.  Definately recommend that you try a sample first: it is an acquired taste for adults!  I love it and always have done: it has a strong 'meaty' and salty (only 8%) flavor that I love to spread on toast (GF, of course) and butter.  Also great to add to a stew as it brings a deep flavor to the palate: works brilliantly on either red meat or chicken thighs (not too sure why it does not work with white breast meat, it just doesn't).",1
"Title: Styk your toe in the water!
Review: These seem to be the best boats on the market for the money.  They come with everything you need, and some nice touches that are over and above what I would expect.  First of all the boat is very rigid, the technology has been borrowed from the military, a drop-stitch that produces something that feels very solid.  The Puffer is JimmyStyks second largest boat and is around 11 feet long by 31 wide, but is very easy to carry with handles and  webbing.  The pump is dual action, which means you are pushing air on both strokes so inflation only takes five minutes or so.  Fully extended, the paddle goes past eight feet, there is a leash, carry bag, puncture repair, and a cinch strap so you can roll the whole thing up when done.  The fin is detach",1

I've tried taking water out, putting water in, unplugging and plugging back in, changing plugs. I'm at a loss. It will probably cost me more to ship it back then to get a new.one from another company.

Review: From someone whose periods have turned very heavy in recent years, the Softcup has been a lifesaver!  These things do NOT leak. They do take a few times to get use to inserting/removing without making a mess, but stay over the toilet, have your other hand ready with TP to catch/wrap for the trash can.  You'll get the hang of it. I have leaked through heavy tampons WITH liners combined in an hour, but the softcup will hold it all for 8 hours. No more ruined clothes. No more messes while sleeping.  These are fantastic!  BTW, yes, I have had children but I don't think my older teenage daughter would have difficulty using this.",1
"Title: Complete Soundtrack...
Review: Note: This review is for the Complete 3-CD Soundtrack of the film ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence.""<br /><br />The soundtrack for Steven Spielberg's under-rated masterpiece is nothing short of fantastic and worthy of joining the ranks of John Williams' other scores. I really can't say which tracks i like best, but i really love the sentimental themes (which includes the scenes with Monica & David), the two versions of the haunting ballad ""For Always"" (which has made me like Josh Groban's rendition) and Ministry's song at the Flesh Fair. ""Abandoned In The Woods"" is a great track; sad but poignant. I also like ""Reunion,"" the alternate track of the same name & ""End Credits.",1

Review: The final installment and the final Bendixon sister had two of the tropes that endears me the most - enemies to lovers/single parent. Camryn had her perfect life ripped from her hands, forcing her to return home with nothing but her tattered dreams and a broken heart as well as the loss of her confidence. She returns to her hometown and her childhood home. She has decided to help salvage her family business along with her career. She is faced with might prove to be an insurmountable task of digging the business out of a financial hole. When competing for what would be a lucrative contract, Camryn comes face to face with Will from the opposing company in the fight for local construction contracts.

"Title: Amazing game! But not worth the $$ for special edition
Review: I have the original not-special-edition Skyrim and have played the Special Edition to compare. Skyrim is an absolutely incredible game that has given us literally weeks of gameplay. I mean, it truly is robust, beautiful, captivating, addicting, epic - everything a game should be. However, I found that the Special Edition version on PS4 did not add much...to me, it would not be worth the money to purchase just for the enhanced graphics. Now, the advantage to this edition is that it has other DLCs already available, so if you don't have Dragonborn or Dawnguard or the other DLCs, I think this version would be worth the money. Also, this version enables some mods on the PS4, which is a new feature, but not something that really revs my engine.<",1

Review: What guitarist doesn't have one of these Snarks? If it's you, it's time you got one. Joking aside, it works really well. Some people moan about being a few cents off, but you know what? Get better gears and a much more expensive tuner. This little guy gets you close enough for funk. It's actually pretty accurate despite the naysayers. I will say that if you've got a loud bassist on stage while you're trying to tune up with it, the bass vibrations could interfere with its readings. For this reason, I have to get a pedal tuner.<br /><br />I'm also starting to think it's bad form to have one of these attached to your guitar on-stage in a band. I feel it's tacky. That's personal preference, though, but shows how popular these things are. If you",1

Company wouldn't replace it because Amazon gave me a refund I never asked for, before I even received it, so watch out when talking to customer service.

I have worn all types of lashes and I will have to say these are hands down my new favorite. I have used other magnetic lashes before. The eyeliner didn’t stay on, or it was clumpy, and almost more of a charcoal color. Not only that they were expensive and they had little magnets that would bother me after a while. However these!!! Ok, let’s talk about the liner. It was so easy to use. The marker made it easy to make a perfect little flick (cat eye) at the end. The liner is also smudge proof and waterproof!!! It’s also a rich color black which I love. As for the lashes... I purchased the 3 pack and they are beautiful. Not too dramatic...",1

Review: This would make a great gift for the family member who is into fitness and exercises regularly.  This is not for the novice - but more for the seasoned person into body toning.  The fact that it is a rigid strap rather than a stretchy one, is the difference.  It gives a stretch as if you were working with someone.  And it is for the person who understands what the strap is capable of and how to use it to gain the most benefit.  Comes with a travel bag and good instruction book.

Review: Last night I had the opportunity to watch episode 1. I really enjoy the new lead and find her engaging and a sympathetic character. HOWEVER, trying to shoehorn this new character into the old narrative is ridiculous... it makes NO sense... Dougray Scott is possibly the worst actor on earth and has NO business in a narrative involving THIS batwoman. the ancillary characters other than Fox also make no sense as they have NO connection to this new Batwoman.  The writing is still uptight and rife with hitting you over the head types of social justice messages.. there's no subtlety to them.  It is sad because I am really impressed by Javica Leslie... but with these characters, storylines from another character, and poor writing.. she has a snowb",0
"Title: Christmas Miracle Alpha
Review: This is exactly the type of story I love reading about. A strong independent Omega facing adversity on many fronts, and how He overcomes the various challenges that keep cropping up. For the Omega this started as a an adventure after leaving his dull small town with his &#34;boyfriend&#34; or at least the guy he was sleeping with, who had the car and was driving them. But it got old soon. Stopping, finding odd jobs, and sleeping in the lowest rate motels, in order to pay for their ultimate trip destination - California.<br /><br />But it seemed only one carried more than his share of the financial burden, being responsible, loosing his sense of adventure, arguing more - until the big dust up when the pregnancy stick turned blue. And his &#3",1
"Title: Robbins expertly teaches you how to trigger states of mind...
Review: Specifically, this is what this program comes down to: Tony teaches you how to trigger states in yourself. First, he makes a convincing argument that the quality of your life comes down to the states that you live in, and then teaches you how to trigger yourself into states that you would prefer to live in (happiness, confidence, intensity, peacefulness or whatever states you prefer). One piece of advice: It is best that you come to this program (or just about any program for that matter) with an overwhelming desire to change and have some sort of specific idea as to what kind of person you want to become (the kind of person who lives in the types of states you want to live in). It's a clique, but as they say, ""You've gotta want it.""<br /><",1
"Title: A high-quality hoe, but I was disappointed when it came
Review: I thought I was getting the wiggle loop hoe to review, because that's the picture they showed in my Vine offerings. I've wanted one of those hoes for years, and I confess I was disappointed when I opened this and saw that they'd sent the Dutch hoe instead. Dutifully, though, I went out to trial it in my garden.<br /><br />It's a very well-made hoe. I love the ash handle, and it comes up to my shoulder (I'm 4'11.5""), so it's definitely a good size for me. It's clearly a quality product that will last for many years (assuming a carpenter bee doesn't try to nest in the handle, as one has done with my shovel). The blade is not that sharp, but I was able to behead a bunch of cats' ears pretty quickly. Still, I'm very sad I didn't get the wiggle ",1
"Title: MAGNAFLOW CHANGES MUFFLER DIMENSIONS BUT LEAVES SAME PART NUMBER, THIS PART NO LONGER FITS.
Review: Several years ago, I put together a custom exhaust for my car using Magnaflow part number 11386.<br /><br />It is now 2018, and I need to replace the Magnaflow brand muffler in that exhaust. It has the Magnaflow name stamped into it, and common sense tells me that Magnaflow would still have the same muffler under that part number, or they would no longer carry it at all.<br /><br />As it turns out, Magnaflow no longer makes a muffler with the same specifications as the muffler I initially purchased.<br /><br />Magnaflow has a muffler with the same part number, it's part number 11386. But the new part's dimensions are different. The center-to-center distance on the inlet and outlet pipes are closer together, and the  new part will no longer ",0

Review: Love, Love. Love it!!!  I purchased this for my upcoming & very 1st trip anywhere...to Washington DC in a couple of weeks and I wanted a purse that was ok to bring on the plane but also one that would be good for walking around as a tourist so to speak.  I wanted something safe.  I already have one Travelon bag and really like it so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.  I love the RFID protected pockets.  There are a lot of pockets and is converts to a crossbody bag as well.  I love the color and can't wait to use it.  Thanks again Travelon!",1
"Title: An excellent, flowing blend of intermediate yoga and Pilates
Review: Yogilates is a blend of yoga and Pilates, and in Workout 2, instructor Jonathon Urla leads an intermediate-level class. The practice is broken into three sections, thus allowing you to customize your workout. The first 12-minute segment focuses mainly on stretches from a seated position to warm up the body. In the second segment, you'll start immediate with a shoulderstand/plow series and then move right into the Pilates rollover, which was a nice flow. You'll continue with additional Pilates-inspired abs work and then do some additional core work from an all-fours position; this entire segment lasted about 17 minutes. The third segment was the longest at 29 minutes. After some opening stretches, you'll move into a sun salutation series fro",1
"Title: Toxic For Cats
Review: This product is dangerous for cats as Pyrethrin overdose and toxicity can result in a variety of symptoms, especially in pets, including drooling, lethargy, muscle tremors, vomiting, seizures and death. I researched this product as I found a lot of reviews saying that the fleas just jump off their pets.  Pyrethin is an insecticide that is normally okay around people and animals, however, as cats lick themselves and have hydration issues to begin with, it is very, very unsafe to use on them.  Please look some other product without this ingredient for the safety of your cat!",0

"Title: Dancing With the London Brass: Great Musical Joy!
Review: I guess if I have to find fault with this disk it is solely in its title, which seems to promise contemporary popular-style music. While it's true that Youmans' Tea for Two is present, it's the only item I'd call popular music, and even it is dressed in Shostakovitch's garb. The rest is ""classical"" I'd say, but not the long-hair stuff many dread. Rather it is some of the best dance music written over the past 400 years or so, played with great musicality, vitality, style and flourish, starting with Praetorius and going on up to Youmans/Shostakovitch, most stemming from the 19th and 20th centuries.<br /><br />This great 65-minute 1988 digitally recorded disk seems to be deleted now, but some copies are still available, and if you love brass ",1

Review: Ladies, please please please; stop giving a good review if you had to order THREE sizes up to get a good fit. I am giving it a single star for getting the overall length correct. Everything else is obviously shoddy work from a facility that has zero quality control. :(<br />Bought this for my wife and like so many other reviews, I also ordered a size larger than her usual. No luck for us though. As she tried it on we could hear seams popping!  She has a borderline B to C-cup bust and she could not button this all the way up. The sleeves were too small, most especially where the decorative pleating is.<br />From the shoulders down the whole coat was asymmetrical. The cords for the hood were an obvious clue of how badly tailored this coat was",0

Review: My child has been through some traumatic things in her life that we are working through. Things that scare her turn bedtime in a very challenging thing. I guess I should of read reviews before we started this book. We read about 15 chapters. I was getting hesitant because its about a kidnapping. And there was alot that happens and its mystery type story, which she liked but then you get scary shadow man... Well it triggered something in my daughter and we had a bad night last night. I decided to look more into it and check reviews to see if it wasn't going to get worse. So I read there are deaths including a mom dieing in a boys arms. Is it really that difficult to make children's stories without so much death and bad shit happening. As if ",0
"Title: Not Safe For Baby
Review: I really liked that this was highly-rated and had a Greenguard certification. I had to return the first one I purchased because after two months of an infant lying on it, it had formed a deep ridge in the center on both sides. You can see it in my picture, even without any weight on it. It was much worse with the weight of a baby on it. When my son started rolling, he often couldn't roll out of the middle. Not safe at all. I called Sealy to see how they could address my concerns and I was informed that this product is not manufactured by Sealy at all. This is made by Kolcraft. After calling to speak with them, they agreed to send a replacement. The replacement mattress, unfortunately, has the same issues as the first. After calling Kolcraft",0
"Title: The Worst Book I Have Ever Read
Review: This is not the worst book ever. I'm sure there are thousands more out there. But this is the worst book I have ever read because of its childish simplicity, obnoxious pretenses of wit, and grating style.<br /><br />This book is pure garbage. It’s a single bad joke that beats a dead horse into microscopic dust. I suppose the hit podcast which spawned this godawful cash-grab might have a little more depth when given sounds, music and voices to play with too. But as words alone on a page, I’ve never encountered something so bad and stupid.<br /><br />The book’s only joke is: absurdity. Does it not make sense? The stupider the better = comedic gold to these horrible “writers.” The first page is tolerable, the second is annoying… English litera",0

Review: When I ordered this, I thought I was buying the perfect card wallet for all of my cards - they would be displayed in a way that I should've been able to easily view all of them and choose the right one at a glance.  However, I was mistaken.  The whole purpose of this wallet is to keep your cards safe.  The pockets on this wallet are very loose so I feel like it is easy for the cards to fall out.  I don't know if I got a used wallet or what but I am afraid to use this for fear of my credit cards falling out and losing them.",0

I bought it because of that, thinking it was Organic yet when it arrived, nowhere on the label does it say it's Organic and it also does NOT list the name of the farm as being YS ORGANIC BEE FARMS!

I will not be buying again, I am trying to only eat organic after hearing the horror stories on what's being done to non organic food.",0
"Title: Pictures Seem Touched Up - Real Wig Very Bright, Ostentatious
Review: The wig is the same wig as in the picture, but I feel like the colors must have been edited in the photos. The purple at the top of the wig is very bright and whimsical - more of a bright violet than a mid-tone purple - and the purple in the middle is not the indigo that I expected but more of a pale lavender. I thought I was ordering a much more sophisticated wig, but the overall effect is much more bright and gaudy than I expected. Because of the tight curls and the boldness of each of the colors, it doesn't even look like a smooth color transition.",0

Review: I thought I'd try this after reading all the hype about it and I don't know if I got a bad batch but all of the scents in the sampler pack smell absolutely awful. I was so self conscious about the way I smelled wearing it that I washed my pits when I got to work and applied a new deodorant that I had as a back up in my drawer at work for rushed mornings when I may forget to apply before I run out the door. I returned it and I'm still getting charged for the deodorant. I really wanted it to work for me but I wouldn't even use it it you gave it to me for free.",0

Review: This mat, upon inspection seems like it will be great. It's thick and soft. Great for stretching and laying on, and would probably be an amazing sleeping mat. Yoga - not so much. It tears, rips and slides. I DO NOT RECCOMEND this for yoga at all if you're going to be doing anything other than slow stretching. If you're looking for a nice mat to work out with and do sit ups and stretch on. It is perfect.<br />Note: if you have a dog or cat, I would be careful. My dog walked over my mat once and tore the top of it just by walking over it.",0

Review: This is one of the worst pieces of technology I have ever tried to use!  I tried using this camera on 3 different devices - a Moto Z Force Droid from Verizon, a ZTE Z-890, and a tablet.  None of them would recognize the camera as a USB device.  I ordered a set of USB-C to micro-USB adapters that the manufacturers web site recommended and still had no functionality.  I had Amazon send a replacement and it did the same.  The only thing worse than this camera is the Seek Customer ""NO""-Support!  It took them almost 2 WEEKS to answer my first request for support and when they did respond all they did was point me to the same FAQ page that I had already tried!  I responded and told them about this and ask for some actual assistance.  8 DAYS later",0

Review: Nice product line in general. I was very happy with them until recently. Their product line does not work the recent Mac Big Sur OS update/upgrade. I contacted J5Create and they were unable to provide any concrete expectation of when their drivers for their product will be updated so that they will be compatible with Apple/Macbooks. Their solution is to not upgrade your mac and wait until they are able to catch up. So this means that both of my computer screens will not work with the j5Create adapters.",0

Review: Part failed within 3 months. I decided to personally look over the installation my mechanic did and found the part internally was not the same. I had to remove the cover protecting the solenoid and found metal debris in the filter screen of it. I'm assuming from manufacturing of the product because I see no metal, yet, within my oil pan. I'm PISSED.<br /><br />I ohmed out the coil using a professional grade fluke multi meter and a new Klein cl350 and it reads OL or sporadic resistance reading indicating bad coil.

Review: Udalyn has once again made some really nice earrings.<br /><br />There are six pairs, three round centers and three cushion centers.  Each of them are a larger center stone surrounded by small round stones.  All are lovely CZs and are as sparkly as they can be.  They come in gold, silver and rose gold finishes.  My preference is rose gold, but seeing these in three different metal colors helps me appreciate how such a subtle bit of metal in differing colors can enhance what I am wearing.<br /><br />The earrings have butterfly backs, another preference of mine.  They are comfortable to wear, and for the price I will likely be ordering more for gifts.",1

I wonder when PP will stop putting garbage that's kills birds on the market? My honest advise is not to buy anything EVER from PP.

By the way, their parent company is Woodstream Corp., so I wouldn't buy anything from them either!!!",0

Review: First, I bought 3 sets. Needed NINE fans in the build. Fans work flawlessly.<br />Second, the RGB control boxes and wiring are GARBAGE!<br />One control box has 10 fan connectors. So, it SHOULD be able to run 9 fans. And it does. BUT, Aura Sync can't do what it's supposed to do, other than STATIC ONE COLOR for ALL fans.

Review: pretty good vegetable blend. Has carrots, onions, potatoes, peas, tomato paste, celery flakes, bell peppers, parsley, and green beans. 16 ounce mylar bag provides 1, 540 calories (eleven 140 calorie servings). Has loads of potassium, fiber, some protein, calcium, iron, and some sodium. Whether for every day use, or to tuck away as a prepper item, this is a decent blend, and provides a decent amount of calories and nutrients for the price. Even better as a subscribe and save item.

So in reality you get 9 colors and of those 9, 3 are in glitter colors.<br /><br />The bottles are decent in size and the polish spreads nicely.  You can be generous and put on a thick single coat and pretty much get full coverage.

Review: In case you downloaded this one, and thought it was a new release, then saw actors who are long dead, you were right. This stinker was originally entitled The Shaft and was released in 2001. Either way, this is a mean-spirited exercise full of unlikeable characters and dialogue. There's very, very little to like here and to root for. I found myself not caring about anyone or anything after about 30 minutes of eye-rolling and head shaking. Oh, and just in case you forgot it takes place in New Yawk, everyone has obviously been coached in the dialect. Not for kids.",0

"Title: Don't Order from this Amazon Seller if you may want to return the item
Review: Can I leave zero stars?<br /><br />Don't waste your time/money folks; I strongly suggest NOT purchasing from this seller. This seller will charge you a return fee, so since there are many other options for free returns on Amazon (and elsewhere), and since a free/hassle free return process is often the rule for Amazon purchases, I frequently shop on Amazon. Save yourself the headache and don't purchase from this seller.<br /><br />I have no complaints about the actual product. It was never installed. It was only taken out of the packaging to look at for less than five minutes and then repackaged. For reference, this is a small pot filler.

Who certainly lived a beautiful life and experienced many opportunities, overcome hardships, and were blessed in many ways. This book warms your heart and helps you believe in the spirit and resilience of humanity. It shows how a family can start with nothing and survive, thrive, and leave a legacy for those who follow.

It has a nice, dry heat that just doesn't blow out at you but heats the whole room.  There are functions like high, low, also depending on your position like sitting or the whole room and there is a quiet heat button that has very low heat and has a white noise sound with it.  it does it's job well.

I have purchased two 2-packs (4 batteries total) and they don't compare to the Sony batteries, and one of the three was dead after one charge. Absolutely terrible product. Wasabi has been my favorite off-brand of replacement batteries and they are usually very good... but this batch and another batch that fits another camera have not been good.

Once i opened it i immedietly regreted it. All 8 packs appeared tampered with and resealed (due to packs being discolored, faded, and brittle on both top and bottom indicating they were resealed.

Review: This is a pretty good book about Organized Retail Crime and the way it helps finance terrorism and how most people somehow are willing and unwilling contributors. Here are some things I felt noteworthy from the book.<br /><br />1.The Great Recession also affected terrorist groups - making them more decentralized and had them getting involved with Organized Retail Crime  (ORC).<br /><br />2. ORC is one of the easiest and least detectable ways for criminals to make money quickly and send it to terrorist groups overseas.<br /><br />3.

Review: Absolute Garbage. I bought this watch and after only a month the bezel broke apart and crumbled off the watch. I have never dropped it or scratched it. I sent in pictures to iterate this and they said they could replace this no problem. The bezel wasn't in stock so I happily waited until it was. Once it was they sent it to me along with an invoice for $20. $20 for the cheapest piece of wood on this watch. If I had dropped it or smacked it into something, fine. But  I would not expect a watch in the price range of $200 to have this type of problem and the company not support this. I will be better off getting a watch out of a cracker jack box.",0
"Title: Great deal in my opinion
Review: Free gift box with purchase of a card you would be buying anyhow. Great deal in my opinion.<br />I had no problems with the activation of the card and my gift-receiver was very pleased with it and worked fine for him.<br />Black velvet inside did seem to get black fuzz on the top of the card when it was opened, but it was not bad. Huff and puff and blow it away and you'll never see it again!<br />The gift box was also sealed with those clear circle stickers on two sides, wasn't smashed, and came in one of those thin book boxes for me (only thing in my order).",1
"Title: Bewary of budget Windows Copies
Review: While this copy loaded OK, it was later identified as not authentic.  Unfortunately, this was not discovered until it was past time to get a refund. ( It was installed on my &#34;backup computer&#34; I use only when my main computer is not available.)  There is no other recourse for me at this time than to give this bad review.<br />BTW, this was purchased to replace a previous copy which also loaded, but then was flagged by Microsoft not authentic.  At that point I used a local computer shop who sold me a full price version.  Perhaps ONLY full price copies are authentic!  Beware.",0
"Title: Very easy to use
Review: [[VIDEOID:6c4523dabe9c466c59f8a62df198d6ed]] I know that these are supposed to be for a computer or something,  but I actually bought them for my projector.  I was a little concerned that it would be complicated to use with a different device,  but it works great.  All I needed to do was connect it to the Bluetooth on my phone and the audio comes through as the movie plays.  I can also use it for music if I want.  The sound quality is great,  even outdoors.  I really like the colored lights as well.  The pulse in time with the beat so it's a really cool effect.",1
"Title: Piece of Crap
Review: Don't bother.  Does not charge your phone beyond 30/40%.  If you are absolutely dead out of juice and plug this in it gives you alife line for a copule hours at most. But aside from that (what do you expect for $14), it stopped working after 3 months.  That would be fine if Amazon allowed you to return the defective piece of junk, but they make it so you cannot rteturn it and send you to some obscure return policy page where it say yoy can't return it. Why don't they make that clear up front? What's going on Amazon?",0
"Title: Don't get Tracfone
Review: I had this phone for 3 weeks when  it started acting up.  I contacted Tracfone and over the next 2 weeks we tried to get the phone to work properly.  Long story short, it will not do anything now.  Won't turn off, won't call, won't accept calls.  Tracfone told me over a week ago that it was sending me a new phone.  Called AGAIN yesterday and they told me that a return box was on the way to me and would be here by last night.  The tracking number they gave me is not recognized by any carried.  No box arrived.  I was told that they would have to have the phone back in their possession before they send me a new one.  Of course, the return to Amazon is no longer possible.<br />I feel that Tracfone is playing me.  They have my $250 for the phone",0
"Title: love these box sets
Review: i have bought and bought and bought box sets ever since I bought my first one.  they are, of course, some better and some worse; but unlike stand alone books, I have found the worst to be very close to the best, ranging from 4 to 5 stars with a few of the books in a particular set occasionally being a 3.  I find this amazing.  AND they are in order, ready to go.  you don't have to try to keep them in order or print out lists from the fiction data base on any series (although this is very handy in the cases that amazon does not supply that information -- particularly the harlequin and silhouette multi author series). so, I say again, I recommend these box sets, save yourself time and lots and lots of money an buy box sets.",1
"Title: Great fit and value
Review: I bought these for doling out samples at the farmers market. I've had to wear gloves like this for some jobs I've had in the past and these are every bit as nice as those I've worn for food service and for housekeeping. They are thick enough that they won't tear easy, I have nails and rings but they didn't tear over them. When I pull them off, they stay intact and they go on really easy which is a plus as well. I've only opened one box so far but I haven't had any issues with them sticking together like some reviewers. I sort of wonder if it's a blip in the manufacturing or I wonder if the gloves get too hot in transit maybe they stick together? I'm a woman with average sized hands, I've always worn a medium in disposable gloves and these w",1
"Title: ""Clones"" shows Star Wars as it was truly intended
Review: I can't tell you how sick I am of the occasional negative review that is smug and presumptuous.  Reviews that say things such as, ""you won't enjoy this"" or ""you'll be bored to tears"" are inappropriate.  Tell us your opinion, but DON'T presume to know everyone else's reaction to the film.  Especially since most people have LOVED this movie, that should be a hint that many won't agree with you.<br />Star Wars II shows Star Wars the way Lucas originally intended: with a scope so vast that we'd be overwhelmed and blown away.  Consider the following segment of an older review:<br />&lt;START><br />Even for casual moviegoers who are looking to ""just be entertained,"" the newest Star Wars film even fails to deliver on that task. Unlike the original",1
"Title: Cute Mario toad hat!
Review: My kids absolutely love super Mario, and Toad is a big figure in their imaginative play. My kids already have a Mario and Luigi hat, but we didn't have anything so that we could become toad, so this plush novelty hat was a great addition to our imaginative play/dress-up box.<br /><br />It would absolutely fit an adult, and is definitely sized in adult sizing rather than children's. Nevertheless, this does not stop my kids from putting on their toad hat and marching around pretending to be toad. They absolutely love it.<br /><br />The quality level is definitely something you would get a costume store rather than a higher end piece. It feels a little bit cheap around the edges. That said, it seems sturdy and my kids have lodged zero complain",1
"Title: PRICE DOUBLED!
Review: We actually love these treats.  We train Border Collies and show in AKC conformation.  These treats are universally like by our dogs and are not messy to put in your pocket at ring time for bait (unlike hot dogs, cooked fresh chicken, etc.)  HOWEVER...  In three months they have DOUBLED in price.  In December 2014, they were $24.89 with Amazon Prime, and now (March 2015), they are $42.27!!  I called stewartpet.com, and spoke with a nice person there that said their demand went way up, and their supplier had difficulty meeting demand.  Well, sadly, we will no longer be a part of that demand, as we own multiple dogs and cannot afford this bait.  Sorry Stewart!",0
"Title: Very bold; works best as an Americano
Review: This is a very bold, rich espresso that has quite a 'bite' to it. It's a bit too bold for my taste when brewed as-is and taken black. It works very well as an Americano, with the dilution softening the taste. It's more than rich enough to retain excellent flavor.<br /><br />The capsules have been working fine even though they are not fully metal as the brand name caps are. I've gone through about a half-dozen so far without any of the caps failing, splitting or leaking.<br /><br />A good option if you like your espresso strong, and especially tasty as an Americano. Good value for the price.",1
"Title: Perfect fall scent
Review: I haven't burned these yet, but if they're anything like the blueberry they'll be the perfect amount of scent to enjoy. Love they're made in maine and soy based instead of full of chemicals. This scent smells so clean and is the perfect fall scent for those of us not on the pumpkin spice band wagon<br />UPDATE:<br />These smell soooo good when they're burned. A lot of the trouble with soy wax melts is they lose their scent in a few hours. I've burned this scent for DAYS with hardly any scent loss. Really excited about these.",1
"Title: Yeah, these don’t look like unicorns
Review: My kids received these as Easter gifts and this is the result. They take forever (box says 24-48 hours, but ours took 3 days), so not great for little kids with less patience and/or short attention spans. They don’t really hatch; you have to ‘help’ by removing the shell. They feel slimy, like they’re covered in some sort of membrane when you peel the shell off. You have to keep replacing the water, so they’re high maintenance. Then, the final product: a couple of mushy, lumpy, soggy not-unicorns. They do stand up, though, so at least you can see them in all their misshapen glory.",0
"Title: Leaves clothes smelling like sour milk! AVOID!!!
Review: There is something horribly wrong with these pods. I have used Grab Green laundry and dishwasher pods in the past. I was happy to find a good price on a bulk purchase. However, while the pods prior to washing have a light scent (that I would not characterize as lavender nor vanilla), th!e scent that it leaves in the clothing is somewhere between old-school soap and rotten milk! The clothes still smelled dirty. Perhaps I was using too little detergent? Okay, two pods in...No change. The only thing I use these for now is hot water bleach loads where the bleach does most of the dirty work and eliminates the absolutely RANK odor the detergent pods create. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
"Title: Wast of money
Review: I thought I already wrote a review for this product but they apparently didn't publish it the first time.  This whistle is a joke.  Like I wrote in my first review, I can hear the whistle when I blow and I'm not supposed to hear it.  It's not even loud, and the dogs next door have zero reaction to it.  I recommend the DOGTEK Sonic birdhouse bark control!  That one shuts up the neighbor dogs!  And I don't have to risk passing out from blowing so stinking hard and constantly into a whistle that does absolutely nothing.",0
"Title: Got this by accident, no regrets
Review: When I bought this game, it was a bit of a wild ride. I had originally purchased Inuyasha Feudal Combat for the PS2. When it arrived, it had the Feudal combat case but the disc inside was this game, Inuyasha Secret of the Cursed mask. At first I was angry at the seller for making the mistake but before I complained I decided to put it in and give it a try.<br /><br />And now I am more than happy that the seller made the mistake!!! This game is amazing in a million ways! One, you can play as yourself and interact with all your favorite characters from the anime.<br /><br />You can bond and form friendships with Kagome, Inuyasha, Sango, Miroku, Shippo or Sesshomaru. You play as a girl (or boy) who ended up stuck in the Feudal Era and now you'",1
"Title: Comfortable, soft, and sturdy!
Review: These panties are hands down the most comfortable undies I've owned, period. The sizing is perfect and they don't ride up or down, ever.  You can tell these are quality-made panties as the texture feels sturdy, yet they are incredibly soft to touch. I can tell they will last. Also, another great feature about these panties is that they don't show the panty line when you're wearing tight pants. For such comfortable wear, you will not look like you're wearing granny panties!<br /><br />I bought these for $39.90 (and it appears the price has gone down a bit - now $36.90), but I will definitely be purchasing another pair here in a couple of months.",1
"Title: SO COZY!
Review: This wonderfully fluffy, luxurious comforter is not lightweight, at least I don't think it is, and that's great because it's cold here in the Mountain West in winter. It has fake fur on the outside and a sheep-fleece-like fabric in a matching color inside.<br /><br />It comes compressed in a heavy plastic bag inside a nice zipper case inside a box. When you cut the plastic bag, whoosh! It fluffs up. The air it sucks in is what makes it so warm. My husband and I love it! We feel like royals under furs in a Scottish castle.<br /><br />This comforter would make a great gift, but hey, why give it away! We won't part with ours.",1
"Title: Pretty?
Review: Yes.  They are pretty.  They simply look great when mounted.  I replaced RainX wipers that were less than six months old and, frankly, ugly.  The RainX  did not conform to the curve of my windshield and therefore did only a fair job of wiping.  These Densos cost less than half the RainX and are far better.  So far, these are perfect: no chattering and full sweep cleaning....and really good looking.<br /><br />I AM MODIFYING THIS REVIEW.  AFTER ONLY EIGHT MONTHS, THESE THINGS HAVE STARTED CHATTERING IN SPITE OF THE FACT MY TRUCK IS GARAGED.  ON TO A DIFFERENT BRAND...",0
"Title: Terrible influence on children
Review: Terrible influence on children. I refuse to allow my child to play this yet there seems to be a great following as no matter how much I block it, my son finds something else about it. I am sick of finding him making Google searches about wishing people would die and ending all searches with fnaf. He might think is just funny and innocent, but games like this are ways to desensitize kids and are a gateway to further and more serious violent acts. There is no reason my 10 year old should be looking up the things he does. I have never allowed him to play this and he is now banned from YouTube and all other websites but those that I approve. I am about ready to start recording his screen or just disconnect the internet entirely and only allow h",0
"Title: Great taste; handy for baking
Review: I'm impressed with the taste of this banana powder. While it's not as strong of a taste as a fresh banana, it has a good flavor to it that is more along the lines of a just ripe banana rather than a over-ripe one. While it can be used for a variety of purposes, I use it for baking. It provides a nice banana flavor without having a heavy texture to the final product as you get with fresh bananas.<br /><br />I tend to use over-ripe (brown and soft) bananas for baking since the flavor is richer. This has a lighter flavor that is more along the lines of using a just-ripe banana. Since it doesn't weigh down the texture of items such as cookies, waffles or muffins as fresh bananas do, it's a lot more versatile -- I've been able to add banana flav",1

The stones were very colorful and beautiful.<br />They are pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people. I think they would be good for anyone from a child to an adult.<br /><br />I thought these were unique. They came packaged nicely. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />They were very comfortable to wear. They were flattering on. They felt secure on my ears. I thought they were a reasonable value.

"Title: Soft Comfortable And Roomy- Need Robe Or Layer For Modesty
Review: I love nightgowns.  I used to try to wear pajamas, but for some reason, nightgowns just felt more comfortable and less restrictive.  Despite that most others seem stuck on pajamas, I am thrilled to find more places making cotton nightgowns again.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />The fabric of this nightgown is very soft and it is knit.  It is comfortable and very easy to relax in.  It is somewhat see through, however, so I wear a thin cotton sleeveless nightgown under or over it when I do not want to wear a robe.<br /><br />STYLE<br />The yoke is very nice.  It has just enough trim to look fancy and not so much to look overdone.<br /><br />FIT<br />The sleeves of this are plenty long enough for comfort but not so long that they are annoying.  My arms",1

"Title: Balancing it out
Review: First of all let me say that i'm really rating this album with THREE STARS. I gave it 5 stars to balance the rating due to all the idiotic hate reviews this album and band are getting.<br /><br />Moving on to the review, I have to say that i'm a real huge fan of Avenged Sevenfold. I was first introduced to these guys when a friend showed me the video of ""Bat Country"". In all honesty I didnt care for the music much and just brushed it off. To make a long story short, I went out and bought their first two albums and LOVED the music.<br /><br />This album, however, just wasnt my cup'o'tea. The music is okay, it isnt bad. This just isnt the type of music i'd buy or stop to listen to if I heard it on the radio. A7X has strayed from their metalco",1
"Title: A few too many bells & whistles for me...
Review: These seem to be good quality, and the sound quality is good, as is the battery life. What I don't like is that it seems to have a lot of options that you can program on or off. But I'm having trouble figuring some of them out. For instance, when someone leaves a message, it not only plays through the base unit, but through the handset as well. So, if there is a caller you'd rather have leave a message than talk to at the moment, you are stuck listening to the message they are leaving. I tried turning this option off, but ended up turning off the answering machine completely. So I turned it back on on the base unit, but now it plays again through the handset. A bit annoying. I have a friend who calls (usually at dinner time or while I'm wat",0
"Title: Great scent but barely leaves color
Review: My son was super excited about doing something ""different"" with his hair during virtual learning this spring, and we let him choose a vivid color. We read the reviews and chose to take a chance even with the negative reviews given the overall 4-star rating. My son has light brown hair and even with following the directions exactly, this product barely tinted his hair. He was so excited to use this the same day it arrived, and it broke his heart that it didn't work. Leaving a 1-star review is the strongest ""Mama Bear"" response I can do to save others from the same experience.",0

I will admit that I am a Jackson fan and believe him to be innocent of charges against him.<br /><br />Having said that I cannot give this book a good rating. I was really hoping that Ms, Jones would present the facts in a unbiased way. She is so far incapable of that.  She repeatedly uses statements like &#34;it seemed as though&#34; or &#34;the jury felt&#34; or &#34;she was obviously lying&#34;. Whenever I read this type of leading sentence structure I must question the authors motives. As a fan and a believer in Michaels innocence I find these leading statements offensive. I was hoping ",0
"Title: Like Watching Paint Dry
Review: I purchased the first episode, and after 20 minutes or so, I had force myself to finish it.  It’s dreadfully boring.  The show went back and forth between two ranchers who apparently hunt fossils to make ends meet.  Make ends meet?  One of the ranchers apparently has a set of dueling dinosaur fossils worth a million dollars or so, but is holding them for better offers.  I wish I could make ends meet like that.<br /><br />And, as another reviewing pointed out - apparently without taking the time to watch an episode - the ranchers naturally go at this as a money making project, as opposed to an academic pursuit, and are not adverse to bringing in heavy equipment to speed the excavations.  You have to wonder what could be lost by using these m",0

Review: This listing is for 5 boxes of Gemelli. It says 5 boxes in the search results and 5 in the number of items, but I was only sent 1 box, and because it's food there is no option to return or replace.<br /><br />Nice racket, really, getting people to pay ~$10 for a single box of grocery store pasta.<br /><br />I see from other reviews that lots of people are expecting 5 and getting 1, so obviously it's not just a packing error.

I color code my kids activities on my calendar, which makes it easier for me to keep things organized.<br />These markers are so light that it is difficult to read them, even close up. I attached a picture of the colors. I used them on a paper in a sheet protector and on a true white board. They are shamefully pale and  an utter waste of money.

Review: These quick puffed snack treats made from<br />Chickpeas and lentils are so much better than I anticipated.<br /><br />They are more dense than the typical puffed snack and I’ve found the 110 calorie, 24g single serving is reasonably filling and satisfying for a mid afternoon snack.<br /><br />Both the Aged White Cheddar and Sour Cream & Onion flavors are very well done - rich and savory.  The Aged White Cheddar contains 4g and the Sour Cream & Onion 3g of plant based protein - helping to fill you up and keep you going longer.<br /><br />This is an excellent tasting, high quality, healthy snack that I definitely recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE m",1

Review: ""BATTLEFIELD: BAD COMPANY"" is like being in a big screen movie akin to ""THE DIRTY DOZEN"", except that you get to be an active part of the action; explosions all around you, enemy tanks aplenty, suddenly attacking you, and your ""BAD-COMPANY"" squad, assisted by their Air Support Gun Ships, and sneaky relentless ground troops that are determined to end your existence!<br /><br />Even the Theme Song implies that you're going to be in for a thrilling good time, from the very beginning.

I have been mixing peppermint essential oil with distilled water in a glass spray bottle, and spraying it along the baseboards and sills for months. I actually see very few spiders or insects!

"Title: Awful, waste of time, unusable
Review: This thing looks great. It's pretty thick, padding the phone. The problem is that it's unusable with the hard buttons. Had to dig the fingernails in push the buttons. There is no give in the case so you cannot wiggle around to get the volume buttons to match up. It was a nightmare to use. Then, it was nearly impossible to remove this case once we decided no longer to use it. Again, there is no give at all, so it's impossible to get the phone out. I had to cut through the case with scissors and completely destroy it, and oddly it fell apart into two pieces. So anyway, completely disappointing.",0
"Title: Wishful thinking.
Review: I worked closely with Maharishi for more than five years, and he was nothing like the person described in this account. Many of my friends were on the course in India that she describes, and none of them corroborate her story. I'm not sure why someone would concoct a fiction like this, but perhaps it began as wishful thinking, amplified by unfamiliarity with extended meditation, and then grew  out of all proportion over decades of reminiscing.<br /><br />For a much more informative portrait of Maharishi, I highly recommend the beautifully written and deeply researched Transcendental Meditation: The Essential Teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, by Jack Forem (recently revised in a new edition) available on Amazon at [...].

"Title: Very Sticky Strong Tape!!
Review: Impressed with this bundle.  My husband and I tried it on plastics, metal, masonry, even some woods and this tape is strong. Also it has a thickness that many other brands do not. We have a plastic board panel under the house that we made to close off a 2 x 2 foot open section made of cinder block brick, and this tape gave all the adhesion needed to fasten the plastic panel to the cinder block.  Furthermore, this was in an area that is damp and cold.  He did have to press the tape on tight but afterwards the tape was so tight on the plastic board that it could not be pulled off without ripping the board.<br /><br />This tape is very good quality that has many uses.

"Title: So far so good
Review: It was easy to repair our lawn chair, which uses clips. We have a second one that I will repair when the strips on those tear more (the same two strips, so I guess those two vertical ones in the middle take the most weight). There was no chance in finding the same color, so I just went with another pretty stripy color. It'll blend better in the second chair which is blue rather than yellow. Also, the original chairs have webbing that is 2 3/4"" which can't be found anywhere, but this 3"" worked just fine.<br /><br />If these start tearing right away or I have another problem, I'll update my review.

Who is/was this Samantha person, and why is/was she so ardently pursuing a friendship with Riley?)  Ignoring clues along the way that suggested I was probably going to be disappointed (eg,. the rather "" flat"" portrayal of Riley's psychiatrist, whose demise was never fully explained; an ""on again/off again"" involvement of both Riley's sister and her neighbor in the developing plot), I kept reading till I ""smacked up against"" the book's final mediocrity - it's ending.

And yes, language was set to English.<br /><br />I had a very hard time installing. Did not fit well at all. If you have an old school car with a manual rear view mirror, it will probably fit fine. Our rear view mirror has all the built in electronics making it a bigger footprint.<br /><br />Camera quality itself was horrendous.

"Title: Excellent product with outstanding additional tools and parts.
Review: I will join the majority of other purchasers who find this to be an outstanding purchase.  The solidity of this mount is superior.  It holds the TV perfectly without wobble or play in the mechanism--it is stiff and rigid.  As for functionality, the up/down tilt, outward extension, and 180 degree swivel side to side is super.  What also impressed me was that they included screw sizes for several types of TV mounts, the tools and anchors to mount the device to either a stud wall or concrete/stone wall; a level to insure correct install, and an HDMI cable.<br />If I need another TV mount, I will certainly buy Mount Factory again.

"Title: The First Wave of the Weavers' Recordings Bring Back Great Memories of the Late 1940s and of the 1950s!
Review: For anyone of my age (70, writing in Nov. 2013), the Weavers are a cherished and joyous remembrance of childhood and youth. Growing up in L.A. County in the 1940s through mid-1960s, the Weavers often, as I recall, made television appearances on variety shows and the like during my early years, when we had T.V. several years before it finally reached Québec or Canada, where I by now have lived most of my life. The Weavers' recordings were heard frequently on radio and sold well, too, on 78, 45, and eventually 33.3 r.p.m. discs, of which I have many in my personal collection.<br /><br />Along the way, the group acquired a reputation, and at times censure from right-wing politicians, for their political and social stands. By the time that I sa",1
"Title: Cool shape and makes a difference
Review: These tiles are pretty cool. We have a hallway that acts like an echo chamber between two parts of our little townhouse and not much seems to help. I put these up on both sides of the hallway and they both look really cool and are helping with the sound. Don't expect a magical silence--you're not going to get that. But they have definitely helped take the edge off the sound travel.<br /><br />The tiles are a little smaller than I expected... they're 14 at their widest parts (like from far corner to far corner), but 12 inches across from edge to edge. They did not come with any kind of adhesive tape or way to put them up--just the tiles. I attached them to the wall with a couple squares of nano tape on each tile. They are very light and don'",1
"Title: Valuable tools
Review: This book/CD ROM combination is a quick-start tool for internal auditors who need to drill down to the essentials and eliminate the time it takes to develop in-house aids for compliance.<br />The book is a mere 119 pages, of which approximately 110 are main content.  It covers Section 301(audit committees), Section 302 (quarterly CEO and CFO certifications), and Section 404 (management assessment of internal controls).  Each part of the book is brief and assumes familiarity with Sarbanes-Oxley.  The value is in the essentials.  For example, Section 301 material provides an audit committee charter issues matrix, which is typical of the tools that are provided in conjunction with discussions of other sections of the act.<br />On the accompany",1

Review: I ordered these (2&#34; long) because I need to replace the bolts that hold the cap on the hubs of my rear axles.  Mechanic only had Grade 5.  We had to drill out the old bolts that broke off, and tap the holes deeper.  I purchased these because they showed a bolt that was threaded all the way (no shoulder).  The bolts that arrived have a 1/2&#34; shoulder on them and can not be used.  For the $10 it cost me, it's not worth the hastle to send them back.  I've since ordered 1 3/4&#34; long bolts and they came fully threaded so they will work.",0

"Title: Excellent Second Helping of Chicory Inn
Review: I selected this book for my wife who read the author’s first book in the series, “Home to Chicory Lane” last year and eagerly wanted to get her hands on the next book in the series. When “Two Roads Home” was released I pounced on it and presented it to her. It has definitely met her expectations and she is already talking about wanting to read the next book in the series.<br /><br />The premise of the series itself is centered on the Whitman family, with Grant and Audrey converting their home into a bed-and-breakfast inn after their adult children have moved on and started lives of their own. This book centers on their daughter Corrine and her husband Jesse. Jesse is considering a major career adjustment and crosses paths with a coworker wh",1
"Title: Integrating this with your Fitbit turns monitoring your health into part of your lifestyle.
Review: This is an awesome addition to your fitbit. A lot of people have reported that the body fat % feature does not work because there is too much variation depending on how hydrated you are at the time of weighing. I use this to my advantage because it gives me a great idea of how much water I'm holding when I suddenly regain 2lbs due to a salt heavy meal the day before. I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in purchasing it.<br /><br />I weigh myself every morning wearing the same general sleep clothes and my fitbit and it updates my fitbit dashboard with my progress toward the weight goals I set. It has a graph that starts the day you set the goal to the day you achieve the goal and shows you your progr",1
"Title: (almost) everything you need to get started!
Review: [[VIDEOID:ea25560e7301570fbd42bf049b18922e]] I am new to airbrushing, this kit is solid, and I’m thrilled with it. I bought it for art dolls, models and filling in backgrounds for acrylic painting.  I was a bit intimidated but once I unpacked it I was able to get to playing around with it within 20 minutes or so after reading the instructions and steeling myself up. The instructions are thorough but brief. There is a learning curve, I had difficulty controlling the dual action trigger initially but started to figure it out. I had some issues with pressure at first, but that was likely from inexperience, sometimes I just couldn’t get it to flow or there was a pause. It happened a lot less the second time.<br /><br />The included airbrushes a",1
"Title: Beware the Pretty Packaging!
Review: I tried this creamer because I thought if it costs more than store brands, then it must be good!  I have used Coffee Mate for years, but it gives me acid reflux now.  I checked on the internet for ingredients and it is not lactose free.  This stuff even burns if you light it.  Like a mini-explosion!  No more for me.  I am so disappointed because I always like artificial creamers instead of milk in my coffee.  This is truly ARTIFICIAL CREAMER.  It contains a product called casein (sodium caseinate) which will burn.  Scary isn't it!  I am tossing out my large container because every morning I get acid reflux from Coffee-Mate and most any powdered creamer that contains ingredients that we don't know about or understand.

"Title: Awful, defective filters
Review: I bought three of these filters. After installing the first filter, and running water through it for a number of gallons, per the instructions, I drank my first glass. The water tasted HORRIBLE. It had a very strange taste, some combination of metallic or chemical or even fishy – something was just way off. I thought perhaps I had just gotten a dud filter and installed the second of the three, yet that one has the same problem. To make sure it wasn't in my mind, I had my wife test the water too, and she took one sip and spit it out. FYI I bought the filters direct from Frigidaire, not from Amazon, so I don't think it matters which vendor they are purchased from. There is something wrong with their manufacturing. I'm extremely disappointed a",0
"Title: HORRIBLE Rendition! Should have never been put on the Market!
Review: XMas Album? Not on anyone's life. Amazon doesn't have live streaming on this and the ONLY way I purchased it was based on hundreds of 5* ratings! Ms. Swift should pull this Album OFF the market (and refund everyone that purchased it the money). ONLY die-hard fans, groupies, (or family and bus. contacts) would rate the Album as they did.  Otherwise, one that has listened to ALL genres' of Artists' play these songs, 'stat' realizes this was made overnight as after thought (to make $millions-which she did) WOW. Regardless of genre', any SERIOUS Artist that would make a XMas album, MUST have insight as to what the holiday is all about. SOUL must be shown, and an understanding as to the music.

"Title: Finally a re-usable that makes GOOD coffee
Review: Finally! Finally, I have a re-usable K-cup that works! I have bought 3 or 4 re-usable pods from local stores (Walmart, Target, and a grocery store). The biggest disappointment is when my coffee just clogs into a big mass in the pod & I end up with week coffee. When I saw this one, right out of the box, I thought it was going to be the same thing. Thank GOD that this works. I have to get used to adjusting the right amount of grounds to get a balance of &#34;not to strong, not too weak&#34; because with the old re-usables, I couldn't get it strong enough. I got this at a HUGE discount, but I'm going to be ordering another couple of sets asap to have around the house.<br /><br />If you have tried the usual plastic-lidded re-usable pods (you kn",1
"Title: Horrible Never Again
Review: I really hate this printer. Nothing but trouble. I have never been able to use it without having an issue. When I want to print I want to print not spend an hour fixing something. The other thing I hate about HP printers is the amount of junk they install. Including the drivers. Besides this the amount of ink this thing uses even for setting up is robbery. When I install new ink cartridges the levels go down immediately after setting up. This printer was made to suck up ink. You will need to buy 5 ink cartridges in order to run. If one is low or out then nothing seems to work.<br />HP has figured out how to sell you ink...just buy this printer.",0

Review: After reading lot of reviews I got this seat cushion to relieve back pain from seating too long at work. Came before the expected delivery. Package is good, It looks and feels like a pretty good seat cushion, firm but not too hard  that it makes the butt ache. I feel it is a good product at first blush, it gave me quite a bit of relief to my back and seat but I will be updating in a week or two to report the full effect.<br />REVEW AFTER ONE WEEK It is in my opinion the best decision to purchase this. I can sit an work long periods without pain in lower back. The cushion is firm and material is very good.",1

"Title: If only I could choose -2 stars
Review: Although this printer worked fine for the ""test"" print that it does on startup, it has successfully printed NOTHING since. The printer area does not allow anything to stick to it, so the printer mechanism just drags the melted filament around. It's a joke. I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and he's tried everything to get it working properly. Spent hours watching videos. Bought different filament...twice. Even bought a ""special"" glue that was supposed to help. It's been a total waste of time, since the week after Christmas. Rating -2/10...would NOT recommend. That's a negative 2. Worst gift ever, and I spent a lot of money that I can't recoup.",0
"Title: Time to Try Norton, Again!
Review: I have used nearly every Norton product ever produced going back into the early 90's.  Each year, like may of you found, the product got bigger, and slower, and used more resources.  Even so, I felt it was one of the best products for Anti-Virus protection out there, and the add-on tools to keep my PC running nicely were used many times.  As I began to stock-pile lots of PCs in my home (as many of 7 PCs even though we only have 6 people in our house-hold), the cost to stay current with Norton was just too much, even when I played the [...] games that many of you did too.<br /><br />I then went to CA's Trend Micro product (I get this free from where I work), until it trashed my PC during an in-place upgrade (from one version to another).

Review: Update 4/26/17 I have only worn these 3 times now. A stone a has already came loose and is gone. Real bummer and I wish I had at least gotten to wear them more. I'm not sure how my friend's pair has held up. She'd probably not want to say even if they did loose a stone. I don't even have long hair for them to get caught in.<br /><br />Lovely earrings I got a pair for myself and sent another directly to my friend. Her pair arrived on time but mine was sorted incorrectly by Ups. In no way Amazon's fault. Anyway we are both pleased with our new earrings. I for some reason expected that to have a domed back just as the front bit that is probably my fault for no looking over the product images better.",0

Review: This is my 3rd screen protector. I've had both invisishield and ghost armor before this one. Both the invisishield and ghost armor were applied by reps of the respective companies, and both of them have eventually peeled off in my pocket and become ruined.<br /><br />The ArmorSuit is still going strong and works just as well as any other heavy-duty screen protector out there. Honestly, it was a bit of a pain to apply the first time, but if you're patient, you can do it and it will hold really well.",1
"Title: suction method is very poor
Review: I have a Galaxy S3, and this holder was one of the only I could find that could hold my phone with a case on it.  It looks like some other people have been satisfied with the suction this provides, but it seems I have not had the same luck.  Every way I try to attach this to my dash or windshield has failed.  I have followed the directions exactly, used the included mounting platform to provide a better surface on the dash(flat and level).  I have tried attaching it to my freshly cleaned windshield.  I have tried all kinds of methods of applying the suction film to surfaces.  Nothing I try makes this device stay where it is supposed to for more than 30 seconds, and then my phone comes crashing down.  Aside from the horrible suction design, ",0
"Title: I can't believe that Roth did this to her loyal readers
Review: I loved the first two books in this trilogy...enjoyed rereading them in preparation for Allegiant.  Calling this book a disappointment is a gross understatement.  Did Roth really write this book?  Where were her editors?  Tris and Tobias were barely recognizable as the characters I met and loved in Divergent and Insurgent.  Action(for a 549 page book) was scarce.  Tris' and Tobias' attraction to each other and their relationship was like a sidebar without the passion and urgency of the other books.  Roth portrayed Tobias as a whiney little kid...where did that come from, for heaven's sake???  The explanations for the ""experiments"" seemed contrived with lots of loopholes.  The plot seemed rushed, even though it was a very long book.<br /><br",0
"Title: Beware!!!
Review: The item was defective and broke during the first use and the seller refused to give me a refund. The package showed up severely damaged. The brake doesn't work and the unit continued to roll causing a unsafe condition. The motor worked for five feet then it shut off completely. The mounting bracket is also very flimsy and the max jockey wheel load of 600lbs is false. The trailer tongue wasn't half that limit and it cause the bracket to bend. I would give it a zero if I could, this a a piece of junk. Not worth the money!!!",0
"Title: Why didn't I get this years ago?
Review: I don't know why I had been resistant to buying this before. Cost, probably. This has been wonderful! Came quickly and well packaged. Simple as pie to put together. I do agree with the reviewers who said that the table will change its tilt occasionally. You have to really crank it down in place. That is my main issue, and it may be a deal breaker for some.  I still have good hand strength, and I don't use the table for many things except for my laptop and occasional needed accessories. The table is sturdy, rolls effortlessly on carpet or wood, and the table top has a bit of a raised lip to help keep things in place. Overall I am totally delighted. I had been using a bed tray, which is great, but during the night I would often push the tray ",1
"Title: Great PETG, Great Price!
Review: At least as good as any other PETG I've used so far, and very nicely packaged. The filament itself is vacuum-sealed in silver polypropylene with dessicant. No sign of moisture straight out of the box- stringing and bubbling are non-existent.<br /><br />The included build plate is not something I needed, but kinda nice to have, and seems like good quality. Honestly I might turn it into a cutting board or mousepad. Would possibly be a bonus if you were looking for one to replace a scratched up Ender 3 plate or something, perhaps.<br /><br />Printing at recommended temps is fine, but I always print PETG extra hot for that untouchable layer adhesion. For anyone with the means to do so, this stuff (and all PETG) is amazing at 300C with the layer",1
"Title: Awful - does not work - save your money
Review: Awful design - save your money!  The leg strap is either too tight or falling off.  Even when properly on the Wii will not read the  remotes.  For some reason, the game stops dead if it can't tell what you are doing.  I spend more time adjusting remotes & waving them at the machine to get the exercise started back up than I do actually exercising.

I had this buzz in the line when I hooked up the 1/8th inch headphone jack to the RCA inputs on my mixer. i couldn't figure out why so I did a little research and learned a few things about balanced and unbalanced connections. Contacted a sound engineer buddy of mine for some advice and he told me the why's and wherefore's of my situation and told me what to look for. I am not a wealthy man and found this little gem for $18.  Of course i had to buy some different cables to make it work: 1/8th in stereo male to 1/4 in mono male (x2) for left and right.

I was moving some bulky items like a couch and they were not long enough to use as indicated.  They barely went over the bottom and ended up being hand holds not forearm as they show.  I tried them out on a few smaller things, but then found they were more troublesome than helpful.  They just slowed us down.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.",0
"Title: As always, it's fun to take a virtual trip to the Outer Banks in the summertime
Review: I always love visiting the Lighthouse Library. This time we met Bertie's predecessor who wasn't a very nice person, so what happened wasn't a real shocker. The hunt for the killer was a good one with plenty of good red herrings. I think Sam let Lucy help more in this book than any other so far. Louise Jane wasn't quite as obnoxious as she was once, but she was still a handful that Bertie sometimes had to reign in.<br /><br />The setup at the end to trap the killer was great and led to a quick but exciting showdown. What happened after that was amazing! It's great how this series never just solves the case and ends like quite a few other books have done. There's always closure and plenty of explanations going on even to what might have seeme",1

There are three settings, warm, cool and combination controlled by a small switch next to the USB charging connector on the outside of the ring.<br /><br />The light ring has a clip back. It won't stand up well by itself, but you can lean it against something if there's nothing to clip to.

Review: Beautiful Nintendo Switch accessory. I'm just a daddy who plays occasionally, and get most of these accessories for my kids who are not yet 10 yrs old. What I'm saying is that we are not hardcore gamers, and don't get into the technical aspects of these controllers. Some gamers can tell the difference when something is a split second off. LOL!

Review: Have you ever watched a movie, something happens and your friend/family member presses the stop button because they need to explain something? That is what the first part of this book felt like and that is why I gave up. The girl finds out an animal is killed so we have to pause the story so that they can explain why the reader should care. We meet a young man and again the story is paused so the reader can be told why they care.<br /><br />While the set-up for the story was interesting, the writing style itself was to annoying to continue reading.",0
"Title: Mostly up-tempo with an unmistakable Kansas City vibe
Review: This is a 1980 recording that was captured directly to tape. The sound quality is superb to my ears considering how it was recorded.  The key thing, though, is the music, which features beautiful interplay between McShann and Casey. There are spots where it sounds like they playfully emulated Basie and Freddie Green, but Casey's lead work on nearly every track dispels that.<br /><br />Run through the sound samples to get a taste of the music because if you are a Jay McShann fan (or Casey's) you will definitely want this album. I do want to point out that the Al Casey on this album is the guitarist who was born in 1915 (passing in 2005), and not the rock guitarist of the same name.<br /><br />You need not be a fan to enjoy this album though ",1

I have been using manual choppers to cut it back, and while they work well enough they do make my hands cramp after a while and it is hard to get the hedges looking uniform with them. I have wanted a hedge trimmer like this one for a while, and I was delighted to have the opportunity to try this one out. So far they have proven to be a good tool and they work well.<br /><br />Best feature: this is a really light-weight trimmer and is small and light enough to be very maneuverable.

Review: I was going to purchase a Denso product, but they were no in stock so I decided on this Walker.<br /><br />My 4Runner was puttering in fuel economy.  I used to get 18-21 and was now getting about 16.  My muffler was dying, so I figured I'd replace both muffler (used a Walker 18901 Exhaust Muffler) AND the up-stream O2 sensor.  I've been told the down-stream O2 sensor does not effect fuel economy, but only tells the computer if the CAT is working or not.<br /><br />This Walker sensor (250-24154) was the proper model for PRE-cat (upstream) O2 sensor.

"Title: A fly-on-the-wall view of Chet
Review: This was shot in the Sonet Record library in Lindingo, Sweden on June 30th, 1985. Baker fans will love this performance, and die hard fans will appreciate the intimate setting that somehow makes you feel as though you are setting in a chair in the room enjoying the music and company.<br /><br />The set list follows the CD from this same session titled [[ASIN:B00026KPDY Candy]]. The only vocal is on the first track, Candy, followed by some excellent instrumental performances.<br /><br />Chet is ably backed by Michel Graillier on piano and Jean-Louis Rassinfosse on bass. The overall mood is informal, but the musicianship is not compromised in any way. Each musician pours his heart and soul into each selection. The informality comes from the c",1
"Title: A unique version of IllumiNations
Review: For anyone who loves Walt Disney World's IllumiNations, this CD will be a treasured addition to your collection.  If you have the Millennium Celebration or illumiNations CDs, you'll find that what is on this CD is quite different.<br /><br />First, the back of the CD case lists eleven tracks.  While the names of the pieces of music may be accurate, the CD is in fact just a single track (17:09 in length) containing all of the music listed.  As it is presented as one continuous piece of music, it's not really a problem to have it all as one &#34;track.&#34;<br /><br />Much of it is what we all know as &#34;IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth.&#34;  The main difference in these segments is the addition of chorus voices during the &#34;Chaos&#3",1

Review: When I opened the bag, there was a strong smell of Elmer's glue, but what's really weird is that chia seeds typically have no smell. I dipped a finger in and tasted just a tiny amount of the seeds and was immediately overwhelmed by the taste of mold. When I read the comments, I saw another customer had noted the same and also mentioned tasting mold in the cocoa nibs. Clearly, there are some quality control issues with this brand!

"Title: CHOKING HAZARD - Not for any child UNDER 3!!!!
Review: This toy is good for the intended purpose EXCEPT...as many before me have stated, it's incorrectly marked for kids 12+ months old. I mean the small pieces are small enough to fit into the mouth of my one year old with ease and she is tiny for her age (size 6-9 months).  I would HIGHLY recommend you don't buy this for anyone under 3.  Also, it looks like the manufacturer no longer sells this particular version and has changed this toy to include larger pieces that are not round, so maybe they realized the problem and fixed it.<br />I imagine at some point, there will be a recall on this toy, so save yourself the trouble and buy something safer!",0
"Title: A must have in an RV
Review: We're spending a few months in our RV doing some sightseeing and volunteer work in various Texas State Parks. That means water filters at every campsite, every single time.<br /><br />This set is just the filters and the hose connector, but no pressure regulator. That's fine for us, we always have a pressure regulator and a spare. The water does taste better than without the filter, but not quite as pure as bottled water or home water with a high end reverse osmosis filtration system. Our last filter worked great for about 30 days, hopefully these will last at least that long.",1
"Title: It's getting used, yay!
Review: The kids are using it. That was really all I wanted out of it, a place to put the games that the kids would actually use. Not finding the little postage stamps all over the house anymore, which is good for the lifespan of the games, I think. So what this means to me is that the kids find it useful also, and easy enough to use that it's worth the trouble of not just tossing the games on the nearest flat surface when they swap them out.<br /><br />Yes, this is precisely the same text I left for the storage case for switch games--they both do the job well!",1
"Title: Rod snapped at third connection point
Review: I was super happy with this setup until it broke on the second day of my vacation The first two pieces are completely inflexible, so even though they feel nice and somewhat heavy like youd want for a surf/inshore rod, all of the tension hits right at the third connection insert point.  The insertion tube snapped off clear through when I hooked up with something huge out in the water.  I had 30 lb mono line on so I was worried the line would snap, but it never had a chance.<br /><br />If youre a savvy angler, youre looking at this rod because you get a pretty good sized one that you dont have to check on an airplane.  Unfortunately, a 2 piece actual surf rod for $25 by daiwa or better yet, a fuji product will serve you far better.  Check it ",0
"Title: Horrible
Review: You wouldn't think it would be too hard to design a practice plug that was durable, but this thing is absolute junk!  On my third cast the tip broke off. I tied on the second one, and on the first cast it broke. Save your money and find something else!<br /><br />Update: I heated up a sewing needle and made a hole through the top portion of this, to which I tied a piece of fluorocarbon leader, and this seems to be working fine. You could also drill a small 1/16th of an inch diameter hole.<br /><br />It's amazing how difficult these things are to find in most sporting good stores! Good luck.<br /><br />September 2014 update. Drilling a hole through the top portion of this work fine, and have not had any issues with it since. I like to keep m",0

Review: Slots are too small for any packages of plastic bags/wraps except the smallest you can buy. If you order larger (family) sizes - forget it. The whole thing is not sturdy at all. You can't remove boxes without removing the whole thing unless you secure it to the shelf somehow. They don't provide for this so you would have to figure out how.  In a nutshell...basically useless as a stand alone item. Secure it or don't bother getting it. I think it will wind up in the trash soon. No one even bothers to try to put boxes back in it, so there goes the organizational aspect, which was the whole reason for the purchase. WASTE OF MONEY!",0
"Title: Wow.
Review: When I read the first book in this series, as an ARC (Wicked Deception), I had no clue what type of book it was, didn't know the genre, and found it lacking in a couple of places, but still liked the book and found it to be a good read.<br /><br />Not so with this book.  The second I began to read this ARC, it grabbed me from the very first page and that would have happened even if I, again, had no clue as to genre and style.  The writer has a writing style that lends itself to fantasy and magic, if that makes sense.  I was very pleased as I read this book, and was even more pleased to find out that it was about a reverse harem, I think I should call it that, although it was not that and more than that, all at one time.<br /><br />We met a ",1

"Title: Typical HC-SR04 sensor
Review: I bought these devices as replacements for a robotic car (Picar-X) which also came with an HC-SR04. However none of these devices worked in this application - it turns the Picar-X delivers 3.3V to the HC-SR04 where every HC-SR04 device I've encountered run at 5V. Apparently the makers of Picar-X use a 3.3V variant or perhaps they modified a stock HC-SR04.<br /><br />Subsequently I attached each sensor in turn to my raspberry pi (running the Bluetin_Echo library) and found all three devices worked perfectly.<br /><br />Important to note the pi gpio pins work at 3.3V whereas the HC-SR04 works at 5V so be sure to use a resistor step-down on the 'echo' output going from the HC-SRO4 into the pi gpio pin (the 'trigger' input works fine at 3.3V).<",1
"Title: Third attempt
Review: It's painfully difficult to find mpreg that are longer than a novella and even harder to find ones with likeable characters. So I've tried this author three times. I could never finish! Over half way and each one is so ridiculously repetitive I can't take it. One second someone one says ""oh no, we can't, this is wrong"" and literally four paragraphs later is all sunshine and rainbows and cupcakes. Think of that on repeat. I hit whiplash from it every time.<br /><br />In this book, they're both weak characters. You're grown men! Stand up and act like it! And the evil grandmother, move on from her. Cut her out of your life, file bankruptcy, whatever it takes. And if the parents can't be supportive, you don't need them to drag you down either!!",0
"Title: A workout for your face
Review: I love this skin roller. Since it arrived in the mail, I have used it everything single day, several times a day.<br />It's part of my morning 'wake-up' schedule = drinking a cup of coffee or tea (sometimes iced/ sometimes hot), body brushing and the super icey cold skin roller - if these activities don't wake you up and make you remember your name really fast, then there's no helping you.<br />The skin roller is very revitalizing to use as a wake up, invigorating and energizing tool in the mornings - sure lets you know you're alive.<br />From a beauty perspective, it tightens the skin and is great to use some time after applying a moisturizer, serum or oil to your face as it makes the skin tighten/ constrict and closes pores, thereby closi",1

Review: I, too, love this movie!  Ten or more years ago, I found a video tape at a local video rental store marked for resale as a previously viewed item.  I had never heard about Final Fantasy.  I didn't know anything about it except what the slip cover described.  I liked what I read  and decided to take the risk since it would not cost me very much.  I am on medical disability and rarely go out to a movie theater because of pain while sitting and the cost.  I'm happy I purchased it, because, as I said:  I love it!  I am on Amazon today to purchase the DVD so I don't have to worry about the tape wearing out.  It's worth watching, and to me, it's worth buying . . . twice!!!

"Title: Very, very disappointing. In my opinion, shouldn't be sold. Difficult to use and very unstable.
Review: Vive is a solid company that generally turns out good products.<br /><br /> This one, however, is a total loser.<br /><br /> Assembled, it is unstable. In use, it can sway to the right and left.<br /><br /> The bottom bar, intended I think, to minimize or eliminate this sway projects so far into the front that I can pull my feet back to get up without assistance.<br /><br /> The arm rails are not stable and, thus, not safe.<br /><br /> And, thought not mentioned in the description, this frame is an awful match for a traditional 15 inch high toilet. You can’t get any leverage rise from it.<br /><br /> I packed it up for return within an hour or so of opening. Personally, I don’t think this product should even be sold: it is way too unstable.",0
"Title: WORST GUITAR ON EARTH
Review: I got this for a 10 year old girl who is a beginner guitarist. The the guitar arrived here looking pretty nice with all pieces, this guitar is ALL looks. I tried strumming the guitar (without being tuned) and it made a terrible buzzing noise. It took us about 3 hours to tune it and once we got it even close to sounding right, it made the terrible buzzing noise still. The strings are extremely cheap. But the strings are NO match for the amp! Without even strumming the amp screeched like crazy. Once we did strum it, you cant even here the guitar. Just the screeching noise. Are 10 year old child was very excited about this and is now very disappointed. Guitars at a toy store for 3-year olds have better quality. We are sending this back immedia",0

"Title: Disappointed
Review: I’m shocked by the great reviews of this product. I ordered it thinking it would make potty training a little bit more of an independent effort for my 2.5 year old who needs help getting up to and off of the toilet. She was SO excited to see it when it arrived and we put it together right away. First of all, it does not fit a regular round toilet as it claims it does. It didnt lay flat on the rim because there wasn’t enough room, so we put the seat of the regular toilet down and set it over that. Then my daughter climbed up to see if it would shift at all and thankfully it seemed relatively sturdy! However, the seat hole is wider than the other typical potty seat we had on there before and she was absolutely terrified of falling in, started",0
"Title: Poor quality.
Review: Chain, initial charm, and birthstone metal setting all become dingy and lose their luster after only a few wearings. The jump rings are not sterling and the setting of the faux stone is also not sterling. Everything turned brassy (plating came off) except the initial pendant, which as mentioned, became lackluster despite several gentle methods, including taking it to have cleaned/polished at my jeweler. Jeweler inquired as to where I made the purchase and encouraged me to return it because “it is junk”. STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT PURCHASING unless you only intend to wear it very occasionally or unless you keep in mind it’s more of a fashion piece.",0
"Title: It now looks like it did when it was brand new
Review: I have no experience waxing clothing, so I purchased a small bar to play around with.  I have a waxed cotton cap that I wanted to preserve, so I wiped it with the wax bar and then used a hair dryer to melt it into the fabric.  It now looks like it did when it was brand new.<br /><br />I have a few ideas for my next project and haven't used it enough to say how well it works.  It was easy to apply and melt, so I'm hoping it'll keep me dry, too.<br /><br />The small bar was surprisingly small ( the largest surface isn't much bigger then a stamp ), but it didn't take much to cover my cap.  In fact, I used so little that you can't really tell that I used any at all, so it would probably work for a dozen applications to the cap, if not much more",1
"Title: K580 vs K556
Review: I like Redragon products. I bought 2 K556, an S101 M101 keyboard/mouse combo, and the H301 headset. I chose the K580 keyboard because its not something I needed but felt I could offer valuable feedback on it in a comparison with the other keyboard I have and have been using.<br /><br />I will start by saying that between the two, you can't really go wrong. It just depends on what you need and how you need the keyboard to function. There are a few things about each keyboard that are quirky and I would change but really, its not that big of a deal.<br /><br />Essentially, these keyboards do the same things but do them differently. For instance, the K556 controls volume by pressing FN and F2 or F3, similarly the K580 presses FN and scrolls the",1

"Title: You can tune it via instrument cable or microphone, you can flat notes, and use it to intonate guitars
Review: Very nice tuner if you don't want to spend a lot of money. I used to use an app on my phone to tune my guitars for a very long time, but it's too noisy at band practice to do that anymore. This tuner has a plug in for an instrument cable, so you can tune it that way, especially if you're playing in a club/bar where it's very noisy. One thing I love about this tuner is that you are able to flat the notes, which is great because I often play in Eb standard, or Drop C#. It also comes in handy when you need to intonate your guitar, because this tuner ACTUALLY picks up the right notes when you intonate it at the twelfth fret. Just that alone makes it worthy of five stars.",1

This carrot powder's ""gritty"" level is quite fine, dissolves really well, and contains awesome natural sweetness with a strong carrot flavor.<br /><br />I've used it to make the usual carrot juice, but I also use it as a dusting over a bed of Japanese sushi rice as well as added it to generic vanilla yogurt (yes this stuff is pretty versatile).

Review: A gorgeous release done by talented musicians whose respect for Elvis is evident throughout.  I have a soft spot to the new backing for Forget me never: a beautiful dobro and a great steel guitar give this mostly unknown song a blue grass feel that accentuate the forlorn tone of its lyrics. Magnificent! The original version of Blueberry Hill was rather uninspired; this one has a bluesy New Orleans sound that would have fit perfectly on the King Creole doldrums. I enjoy these worthwhile efforts to keep him in the limelight, as the CD with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is doing with great success. My only regret: since the songs are reworked, a couple should have been lengthened to exceed two minutes. Overall, it is a magnificent release, ",1

Review: I tried the Wedge along with 3 other no-rattle/stabilizing solutions.  This was not the best solution....  It did help me stabilize my hitch carrier, but it's a real pain to use.  I had to use some small blocks of wood with it because it torques so much when you really tighten it down to provide real stabilization and prevent rattle.

"Title: Delicious and smooth tea
Review: I really like this tea by Purely Plants. It comes in a very nice, resealable bag that allows you to close it back up. Inside it you get 16 pyramid tea bags. I found that you can actually brew it teach bag twice if you want. The second time around it is a bit weaker but it is still as tasty and delicious as it was the first time, just a little weaker. The tea is a bit expensive at $23 for just 16 tea bags, even if you brew them twice and get 32 teas out of it.<br /><br />The tea itself though is delicious no doubt which is very important to me.

This was an entertaining first book in THE LOST WOLVES series. It set just the right tempo for something I needed to read in our chaotic turbulent times, where we've been wearing masks and socially distancing since March 2020. I wanted to find something to read that was uplifting, low angst, and sweet.<br /><br />Well I found exactly what I needed in BETRAYED.

However, the diameter and length are fairly close. Also, while the Jeff Hamilton model has heavy wires, this one has heavier wires.

"Title: Solid Material for Anyone Considering a Church Leadership Role
Review: Anyone who is contemplating church leadership, whether a pastoral team position, a deacon, or any other ministry leadership role needs to know what's expected and how to actually lead. I selected this book, knowing it was probably geared toward pastoral staff in particular but making the assumption that it would be applicable to other leadership roles too. I was right, and it's a good resource for anyone thinking about getting plugged into church ministry.<br /><br />The Bible lays out the qualifications for many church leadership roles - self control, humbleness, generosity, and so on.

Review: To call this ""overrated"" is simply too mild.  It's actually sick, bloody, and incredibly offensive. That Hollywood could heap all sorts of accolades and awards on it, shows only how callous and out of touch the people there truly must be.  This ""comedy"" is nothing more than a bloody slam-job on the upper Midwest.  The Coen brothers would evidently have us believe that the area is so boring and the people are so vacant, that they are driven to lies and murder.

"Title: so it's probably not good for parties
Review: This product does what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />Before you purchase, you need to consider what you are looking for.  This product does not produce a lot of ice, so it's probably not good for parties.  It seems to be slow starting-up; the first batch of ice takes a while.<br /><br />You need to keep an eye on it.  When the ice basket becomes too full, it stops producing.  Less frequently, the water supply runs too low.<br /><br />The design is ingenious.  Most, if not all, of the energy goes to producing the ice, as opposed to refrigerating the produced ice.  So the ice melts back into the water reservoir.<br /><br />I would not suggest it as a supplement to a ready supply of ice.  In our house, the ice-maker in our refrigerator has ",1

Review: My primary interest in buying (again - I already owned the USA Collectibles release) this UK collection was for the new remastering, and because of the SOLITAIRE album.  Among Andy's many many Lps of covering current chart hits, (I always had the feeling he or his producers just lifted whatever was the #1 or #2 hits of the previous 3 months and went into the studio and presto! The newest Andy Williams album...) this one was produced by a man who should have had co-star billing with Mr. Williams, Richard Perry.  A genius with taste, who really knew how to get the best from the artists he produced and to find perfect material for their particular talents.  And this album is among the finest, as far as I am concerned, of the 1970's recording. ",1

Has different small pockets for organizing smaller items..<br />The best part it's waterproof and lightweigh",1
"Title: Does not glow in the dark!
Review: I bought this watch for work as a night shift nurse to replace a previous one I had by the same manufacturer. While they are both &#34;Geneva&#34;, the writing of the brand names appear different, so they are probably knock-off's made by different people. That would not bother me as this is a pretty inexpensive watch. I did however buy this only due to the fact it was supposed to glow in the dark. Mine does not glow at all! Even when exposed to light prior to going into a room. Not as advertised!",0
"Title: Great Product, will be purchasing more !
Review: Total Believer and Game Changer for me.  I was a bit skeptical at first, have tried it on many types of loads and sizes. Does a Fantastic Job !  It did take some trial and error to find out how many balls for what size load I am drying.  My medium size loads of cottons and dress shirts I use 3 balls.  My larger loads, jeans, towels , and bed clothing- I use 5-6.  Also purchased the oils, used one for one of the balls to see if it scented well.  I learned that it does take many drops of oil to get a scent onto your clothing.  But, it did scent my clothes.  I found that if I took the clothes out right away, I did not have wrinkles.  If I let them sit and they became 'cooled off' a bit, then wrinkles did set in. I plan on purchasing several mo",1

The plug keeps falling out.<br /><br />The charger heats up to the point of burning you skin. That is the good part, other than the price.<br /><br />Then it shorted out but with a little duct tape I fixed it for a couple of days until it died. RIP.<br /><br />I then got off the wallet and bought a good charger that fits, does not overheat and keeps the battery charged SAT.<br /><br />Don't waste your money for about $15.00 more you can get one much better than the OEM one that came with the laptop and prevent alot of grief and possibly a fire!!!!",0
"Title: Tween Daughter Loved It!
Review: Always looking for new art projects for my tween daughter. She absolutely loved this kit. She just started making her third coaster. Haven't bought any sealant yet to completely finish them, but have been using the first one she made for a month and none of the crystals have fallen off or anything. Overall it is a pleasing kit. Only recommendation I would make is that purchasers should invest in an organizer with screw-on lidded jars to store the crystals in. Daughter enjoyed sitting on the couch with a lap desk while working on this project, but all it taes to lose a bunch of the crystals inside the furniture is a pet or sibling tipping over the little tray when you have gotten up to use the restroom or get a beverage, putting them away in",1
"Title: Boring
Review: No fun, not motivating, keeps skipping and the audio repeats itself too much.  The controls are way too touchy and by the time you scroll over what you are trying to pick, it jumps and picks it for you.  Frustrating to navigate because of the sensitivity.  Don't bother working out the bugs and buy Your Shape, it is much more challenging and you can tell they put alot more effort into making it a fun game that the Biggest Loser.  Biggest Loser fans, I guess figure it out for yourself, but other games out there are much more fun!",0
"Title: Shorter version is okay, this one is terrible.
Review: I wanted to block off a wider area that leads to my kitchen so I bought this extra wide span gate. I own the shorter Regalo gate and really liked it. This is basically the same gate but includes extensions. The problem here is that the extensions don't work very well. They are linked by metal rods that are very weak. My toddler can just truck through this gate like the Incredible Hulk and it'll separate at the links. Regalo should just make a larger one-piece gate for those needing a wider solution.",0
"Title: If you enjoy reading Ruth Rendell I think you should give this a try
Review: `Domestic Noir' is a perfect description for the novel, as this is not the creepy or menacing story I imagined from the back of the book blurb.<br /><br />Evie Ferrante is estranged from her alcoholic mother Sandra Ferrante. Her mother has been hospitalized, and Evie returns to find her mother's house looks like something from the reality TV show 'Hoarders'.<br /><br />Evie reaches out to their neighbor, sharp as a tack 90 year old Mina Yetner. Turns out Mina has issues of her own with pushy nephew Brian trying to move to a senior care community.<br /><br />Instead we have the portrayal of the aging of a neighborhood (suburban noir?) and its residents. Where you have drama between the laughter and the tears. Family secrets and mistakes.<br ",1
"Title: Small bottle pump!!
Review: Every bottle in the bathroom has a convenient pump now!!! Why didn't I do that years ago? And why didn't I think of this for my mother all those years she struggled with soap, shampoo and lotion bottles that were hard for her to hold because of arthritis and parkinsons?? Now the precious lotions and potions I use in the bath and after are easy for me to dispense in just the right amount. A light touch for the expensive facial cleanser delivers just the right dab - no more slippery bottle and accidental over-squeezes. When I'm down to the last drops I remove and clean the pump dispenser - while using a &#34;Flip-it&#34; to get every last drop from the bottle! When the new bottle arrives in goes the clean dispenser. Ahhhh I love it when a pro",1
"Title: Hate I wasted the money
Review: I purchased 2.  We tried it on a leather love seat in our permanent residence and then on a fabric love seat in our RV.  I threw it away after 1 hour and put the beach towel back on the couch.  I ended up using the 2nd one to make a dog bed over a body pillow (which actually worked quite well).<br />I couldn't keep it in place no matter where I stuffed or pulled the elastic band.  My husband (which never comments on things I buy) came home and asked me to throw it away because it looked so cheap.",0
"Title: Great value with tons of tools, perfect for the beginner - definitely not professional quality but good for practice
Review: Great set, excellent value - many tools and practice locks. This is my first lockpicking set, and this one has a great variety of tools. Look up how to use the different tools before going nuts with them  - I broke one tool in an old lock, but it was a padlock with a small opening and probably rust and I think I used the tool wrong. Definitely suspect these tools aren't great quality, but they're good enough to learn with and I can already open simple locks in a couple minutes. NOT a set for a pro!<br /><br />The black coating is coming off the tools I use most and the metal isn't strong enough that you should ever consider using the tools for anything but picking, pretty sure they'd break with very little force. Used as intended I think th",1

Review: Every rear view mirror adhesive has negative review, but as long as the installation is done correctly, they should hold.<br /><br />Here's what I did:<br />ORIGINAL BUTTON REMOVAL: Watch youtube for guidance. I took my Porta-Sol's micro torch and heated the original button until the adhesive let go of the button. As long as the flame does not touch the glass part, it should not crack.  Lightly wiggle the button with a pair of pliers with twisting motion (NEVER force it to remove or the windshield will crack).<br /><br />On the new metal button that sticks to the windshield, I cleaned the windshield with alcohol and wiped with dry paper towel.  I then lightly sanded the sticking surface of the metal button with 80-grit sandpaper to leave so",1
"Title: Buyer beware!!!!
Review: Like many others who have written complaints about the seller passions for perfume, so do I!  I purchased the rose hip oil last march and loved it. Used it daily, has a light berry/nutty fragrance. I ordered 2 more in september and it was rancid, smelled like fish oil and burned my face.  After multiple emails to the seller they pretty much stated they don't believe me, but will send me one bottle to replace.  It has been 5 weeks and no replacement bottle and they refuse to answer my emails.  Trilogy, the producer, has not answered my email requests for help.  Bottom line is I have been ripped off 43$ and treated like I am a thief!",0
"Title: Another junker from Clark's.  BAD QUALITY and too large...even after ordering down on size.
Review: I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews on this boot.  I received the boots and can't believe the junk I got when opening the package.  Let's start with sizing.  Clark's is nutz on sizing.  I ordered half a size smaller than I normally wear and it was still too large.  I normally wear 10.5 W.  I ordered 10W and it was still too big.  Credit to Amazon.  Their sizing chart was right on with this boot.  When I ran it through their fit app it showed 9.5W.  SO, I guess on this order a WHOLE size lower.  Next the boot itself.  The quality control is so horrible on this boot that the end of the toe, on one boot, had extra flashing to one side sticking out and the other side of it I found where it was cut off too short.  Either an",0
"Title: Love it!
Review: The wall decal I never knew I needed. The seller gets it out to you in great time. It comes complete with detailed instructions, and a practice decal. The hardest part was waiting the couple of hours for it to flatten out before putting up. It was super easy, if you buy a bigger decal like I did, please ask for a second set of hands to get things started, like holding it in place for you while you're peeling the back and applying. Otherwise, this is as simple as it can get. I used a credit card to help keep air bubbles out, and once we removed the top protective layer, I gently used it in a couple of areas that had small bubbles I didn't see previously. Follow the directions about letting it sit for a couple of minutes, otherwise the decal ",1
"Title: Great old lady shoes.... ; )
Review: Pretty comfortable for a Chacos girl. I am 52 and have sworn off heels... but when you have an event -- you need shoes. Bella Vita offers narrow sizes so I landed on this brand with a &#34;narrow shoe&#34; search. I am completely happy with the fit. I am 8.5, and usually order 9 in narrow dress shoes. They didn't have a 9, and the 8.5 worked perfectly. My ankles aren't the smallest, and these still work. The heel is tolerable and with a little cushion insert, I think I will fair well for a few hours.",1
"Title: so comfortable!
Review: These Splendid crop jogger capri pants are SO comfortable and soft - they make great pajama or lounge pants (as long as you do like crop pants/your ankles hanging out). I'm 5'3&#34; and yes, these are above my ankle and they ride up because they are very loose around the ankles and don't have much elastic in the cuffs. The waist has more 'give' and a generous drawstring, and I love the deep pockets. The material is thin/lightweight, which is perfect for summer, but not so thin that you can see everything through them. Maybe you could get away with wearing these outside, but between the thin material and the loose nature of the cut, these definitely come across as lounge pants. I've no problem wearing them around the house, though.",1
"Title: Instead there are better printers you can buy that will work with filament ...
Review: This filament flat out does NOT WORK. It leaks from the nozzle even when the machine has not yet started printing. It also gums up the nozzle. DO NOT BUY. In fact if you just bought a 3D printer from XYZprinting, I would return it immediately because their printers cannot use 3rd party filament and you MUST buy their over priced filament. I would NOT recommmend buying 3D printers from XYZPrinting!! Instead there are better printers you can buy that will work with filament bought from other vendors.",0
"Title: BUYER BEWARE!!!
Review: BUYER BEWARE!!! I WILL NEVER AGAIN PURCHASE ANTLERS FOR MY DOGS from this seller or any other seller.  There must be some type of bleaching process that is used, because the antlers are almost white in color. I think my dog ( an AKC Siberian Husky) must have had an allergic reaction to a chemical used to process the antler…. I just do not know what to think.  I  ordered 2 of these (Large) Deer Antlers for the very first time and I received them in the mail on Monday afternoon, December 12th, 2016. My Husky absolutely loved them. The weather is cool here in December so I only had ONE of my Huskies inside at the time that these antlers were given out.

"Title: Best sweatpants I've ever purchased
Review: These are AMAZING! I mean, as far as sweatpants go, these are the best I've ever bought. They're soft, a nice weight (not that super thick fabric, and not too thin), and the texture is great (not scratchy and rough). Oh, and someone figured out that women want pockets, too!<br /><br />I bought them in grey, and I wish they came in more colors. As it is, I'll order black just because I want more! I like to wear my sweats super baggy, so for reference, I'm 5'9&#34; and about a size 14 with thin legs. I ordered the xxxl, and I could have easily gone with the xxl and had the super baggy fit I wanted. But they're still such great sweatpants that I bought a pair for my mom!",1
"Title: Worth Trying more than once...
Review: When you are very young your skin cells in the epidermis are constantly in a state of rejuvenation. The skin renews itself approximately every 28 days. As we all age, this process can start to take twice as long. So, skin cells start to build up on the top layer of the skin. This causes a dehydrated, rough and dull complexion.<br /><br />Slower cell production, free radical damage and the breakdown of collagen and elastin encourages those little wrinkles to start to appear. You can start to use a vitamin C skin cream and hope for the best, but really you are still fighting all those dead skin cells which can clog pores and promote sebum build up (the cause of breakouts and blemishes).<br /><br />There are no tricks to using this mask.

Review: Yoke Wong is an excellent teacher. With her training techniques you learn to take the music that's in your heart and transpose it onto the keyboard, even from the first lesson.<br />I am at a mid beginner level and although there are things in this course that, I freely admit I'm not ready for, I'm happy to know that I have this information at my fingertips when I'm ready to use it and I'm not going to ""outgrow"" the course too soon.  Having said that, there is surprisingly, a lot of information that I DO understand and she has helped me to have an even deeper knowledge of those concepts.<br />I highly recommend this course. It is worth every penny; especially because I know my abilities can grow with the program at the speed that is right f",1

"Title: Top quality
Review: I've had this on one of my violins for many years. A very nice piece of kit.  I almost always use the fine tuners even though I generally use perlon strings. Really made  for metal strings which is what Tomastik makes.  I don't think the fine tuners would be all  that helpful for gut strings due to how elastic they are.<br />It's possibly proved most useful on the violin when I made it into a baritone/octave violin. The tone is very even considering the huge vibrations it has to handle. It was the only one of my violins that could handle the change(I have 3). I think part of it is due to the Tomastik Tailpiece. Hadn't realized the price had changed that dramatically, but I did buy it 25 or so years ago. It still looks brand new and the tune",1

Review: Sometime in the early 1990's I saw a strange product advertised in Goldmine Magazine and my attention (what little of it I still had) was drawn to the item in question. This product was entitled:  ""Acoustic Live In Newcastle"" and this  was  stored in  a 12 by 12 inch box that contained a hardbound book ""Sting - The Illustrated Lyrics"" by Roberto Gligorov and a 5 track CD entitled ""Sting - Acoustic Live in Newcastle."" I sent my money order in a sturdy envelope and went back out into the world from hence I came.  Upon my return to California a year later I found the package from Royal Post that contained this set.

I have a large head for a woman and it fits loose. I can do my hair, put hat on and it doesn't smash my hair down to my head. It keeps my head warm, dry and feels great. Im not sure on a very windy day it might blow off.  I think it looks stylish. I have had lots of comments on how cute it is. It's also a cute hat for a bad hair day.

The sides of the cup show evidence of buckling when attempting to close to puncture the cup. I even tried the &#34;high elevation&#34; suggestion in the Keurig literature wherein you press the cup down (versus closing the handle to press down) to induce the bottom puncture (which does make it puncture), but I still got the spewing of grounds out of the top (the cup probably still buckled; forgot to check). I even used the part/portion of the old machine with the bottom puncture component (they appeared interchangeable), but still had a mess to clean up (swap",0

McAfee failed to pick up some spyware that Ad-Aware and even Windows Defender got!  But forget the protection; the performance is atrocious!  This program really really REALLY drags your computer to almost a screeching halt.  The program literally took 80% of my 1GB of memory.  The worst part of all was the annoying update pop-ups I got.

"Title: Finally, a Replacement for My 6 year-old Voyager 510?
Review: I have exclusively used Plantronics headsets for about six years now and the latest device, VOYAGER EDGE, only confirms my faith in this company’s products.  In fact, this latest headset may actually be worthy of breaking up my six-year commitment to the Voyager 510.<br /><br />Choosing a “quality” headset is essentially a personal issue and preferences differ from one person to the next.  Aside from the basic expectation of allowing me to conduct a hands-free phone conversation, my personal preferences include call clarity, simplicity of use, battery-life and comfort (the last two being rather important considering my 2-hour round trip work commute).  While the Voyager 510 has faithfully addressed my headset preferences for so long, I find",1

Review: Very cool so far.  I looked into getting one of the more expensive “Force of Nature” kits (similar concept), but this is less expensive and doesn’t require capsules and for just household use this system is awesome.<br /><br />I do wish the instructions were clearer about the amount of salt/time needed for different concentrations (and what different concentrations should be used for).  Also, the scoop that comes with it has a small hole in the bottom which isn’t super helpful for measuring salt.<br /><br />Overall though, I’m glad that I purchased this system.

Figuring out what size to wear in clothes and getting things that look good on me even as I keep shrinking has been a real challenge. When I was offered a pair of these leggings at a discount in return for my honest review, I decided to get a small (which comes closest to my hip measurement) instead of a medium (to fit my waist) because I know I'll be losing a little more weight. I am SO glad I got the smaller size! I don't think I would have liked the medium size at all.

Review: I'm currently refurbishing 4 other dollhouses and 7 dolls as we speak. I bought this on a whim thinking I could create a quick and basic custom house for toddlers...but I simply can't recommend. It's made out of cheap unsealed balsa wood; one climb on it and it would break in a heartbeat. One liquid spill, it would be ruined and warp. The ""screws"" could be easy taken out by a child and the whole thing would start to collapse. For the price, I expected much more out of the size, quality, and furniture. The furniture isn't in ratio with the house and needs to be sanded and sealed (as would the house) anyhow. The ""people"" are just sad. There's much better out there; look elsewhere.",0

However, the company is deceitful with the reader.  They charge MORE than Square does, and they hold onto your money.  The ONLY way that you get the money you are owed, is to send them you BANK STATEMENT, or enter your username and password to your BANK ACCOUNT.

Worse thing is that the new Activation Key for Smart Security renewed ESET Antivirus 9 on my system. Disappointed that I'm not able to use SMART Security to enjoy the features I paid for. ESET tech support was hard to reach and didn't prove helpful. They recommended steps that have to be performed while your PC is in safe mode. Backing up of registries, etc...

There is no handle to pull it up, but you can grab an edge with your fingers to lift it out.  I think a person could add a cable tie, or something similar on the opening that allows the LED light to show through to create a pull-up handle.

In my case, the pin on one side would not release no matter how much twisting/rotating was applied. This was delivered at 8 am and packed back up for return to Amazon by 9 am. The pictures on the web page make it appear to be a quality item when in fact, even if it worked properly, it's grossly overpriced. 👎👎",0
"Title: Painful
Review: Even listening to ten-second samples of these songs was enough to make me wince and cringe. Whoever these people are, they cannot sing. Whoever came up with the idea for this CD - and I completely agree with the reviewer who asked why the heck anyone would create a 'tribute' for Josh Groban, who is only at the beginning of his career - needs to have their head examined. The record company must have been insane to release it.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. Buy Closer and Josh Groban instead. This CD is nothing short of painful to listen to.",0
"Title: Wonderful brown
Review: What a wonderful brown. it's got tons and tons of gorgeous shading, and a dark, smoky, toffee brown. Basically pelikan smoky quartz at 1/3 the price.<br /><br />It doesn't feather on trash paper, even with a super wet 1.1 stub. Dry times are fast. Showthrough is moderate and bleedhthrough is minimal, but there (only on aforementioned trash paper with wet stub)<br /><br />It's a wonderfully wet flowing, well lubricated ink, too.<br /><br />I don't normally like browns (apart from noodlers golden brown) but this is a heavy shader indeed, very professional, very pretty, very well behaved.<br /><br />It really does remind me of black tea that's oxidized in the cup for a while.<br /><br />The 30ml is basically a &#34;trial&#34; bottle.

"Title: Easy to install but nearly impossible to remove.
Review: Worst watch band ever!! First thing I noticed was that the band itself was about 2 inches shorter than any of my other bands including the 2 other Ritche bands I have purchased previously. Then the latch on one of the pins broke off after I installed it and I don't even know how it broke because it came off days after I installed the band which lead to the bugger problem, the band with the broken pin would not come off. I ended up having to take my watch to a jeweler to get the band off without damaging my new Galaxy Watch 4 Classic which added a nice little service charge on top my bad experience. Now I am left a little perplexed because I have been rather happy with my other Ritche bands but I have little desire to risk trying any more. I",0
"Title: Feel and sound like Flatwound Strings!
Review: There were a few places on the packaging that said “brighter” sounding flats but sound like regular flats to me. I went with these flats simply because they gauge and also that I’ve had DR Strings before. Not disappointed but I wouldn’t say this strings are bright at all. I’ll be uploading a demo video to this product to so check that out. I play slab, pick, and finger style. They are quality strings, I’ll say that. I’ll also attach some pictures to this review. This is definitely a playable gauge, no fret buzz which is a huge pro. Over all, happy with my purchase but they probably drop the price on this a little. I think anything over $30 is asking for too much. But that’s all personally opinion. Along with the rest of this review. I was a",1

Review: Where has this little jewel been?  I've tried so many phone holders for cars but none have ever worked because they wouldn't hold my phone ( phone too big its a iPhone 6+). I luv this it's adjustable easy release button or tightening button. For me I like the fact that I use the CD player to hold it (since I forget to play my CDs ) and with cooler weather coming I will need my vents for the heat/air in summer. I also like that it sits vertically so when using my maos app it's easier to read the screen, easier to answer an in coming call etc. I would definitely purchase again and probably will just to put back because every time u find something u really like they discontinue it. I would definitely recommend this to Anyone.",1
"Title: Not Worth Your Money
Review: This game is ok at best. First off the game allows you to go up to level 80 in the game. Though you have a long way to go in leveling the game only kicks off at level 20 because at level 20 you get a mount, better spell and other things. But after level 21 it gets boring fast. Before you get to level 20 you are basically grinding for level 20. After level 20 you are still grinding for level 80. So basically you get a few hours of actual fun in the game.The game gets boring because the quests are empty and all of them are basically the same every time and basically when you get down to it you are paying 15 dollars a month just to get a better weapon for your character and better spells and other things. Now that wouldn't all be problem if th",0

Review: Ok. So. The sides are NOT mesh, but unlike another review I don't think they're selling knock-offs, or if they are (because I've personally never heard of the brand before and wouldn't know either way) they're quality so who cares. I can fit all my shopping in this bag (easily 10 or 15lbs) and it seems well-made and durable. The handles are neoprene-padded and the seems and piping are well sewn.<br /><br />The only complaint I could say is that it's much bigger than I thought (think half a foldable hamper), but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Personally I love it and think it's a great bargain for the price.",1
"Title: One of my most favorite hair products EVER
Review: This sleek serum is absolutely amazing and does exactly what it promises! Be careful though to not use too much. When you use this be careful, it comes out of the tube fairly fast since it is quite runny.<br /><br />If you end up using too much your hair will end up looking greasy/oily which defeats the purpose. When you use this right though, even after applying it to your still damp hair your hair already looks amazing, with lots of shine to it. I have never seen that in my life that my damp hair looks amazing. That was the weirdest experience for me. Your hair is super soft, super manageable and just looks plain amazing. I still can't get over the fact what this product does to your hair.<br /><br />And then, there is the scent of this p",1

Review: As the title states - this ""stuff"" (no pun intended) smells SUPER good. I have thick, coarse, unruly hair. Usually I wash it and throw it up in a bun, and usually when I do that my ends get kind of crazy and the only word I can explain it is ""crunchy"". Adding this milk conditioner to my damp hair before throwing it up in a bun has kept my hair soft and smelling wonderful! It's also a nice large bottle which is perfect for me since I had to use more than the directions stated because of the thickness of my hair.",1
"Title: The sheer bravery of the White Rose's young leaders
Review: It's rare when a movie delivers such a powerful lesson in history as this one.  I'd not been aware of the White Rose non-violent resistance to the Nazi regime until seeing this film.  Indeed, the full story of White Rose hadn't been known until original source material surfaced after the fall of East Germany in late 1989.<br /><br />What struck me was the sheer bravery of the movement's young leaders, the brilliantly staged rendition of the Nazi show trial that followed their arrests and the finality of the quick, shocking punishment that is meted out.  In particular, the show trial scene is movie-making of the highest order with a knockout Downfall-esque performance by André Hennicke as Richter Dr. Roland Freisler.  The production design, ",1
"Title: Comfortable Stretchy Fabric - Order Two Sizes Larger Than Normal!
Review: If you are looking for a Valentine's Day outfit for your husband you can't go wrong with this nightgown. It fits really well, goes on easily, is stretchy and very comfortable. I suggest you buy two sizes larger because these run small from what I heard. I took the advice and am very happy with the size I got. So if you are a 3X order a 5X. I think for us plus size women you have to wear a black bra under this. I'm a 48 C cup and it fits just about right. However it is stretchy! I recommend this lingerie for married ladies who want to look great for their husbands.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

Review: This journal is beautiful. The cover is a deep green and is sturdy and flexible. The pages are nice and thick so no ink shows through to the other side. I’m very happy it’s lined so my writing stays straight. There is a ribbon sewn in to use as a bookmark, a pocket stitched into the back cover and an elastic band to hold the book closed. When I sit down to journal it feels like such an elevated activity now. This would make an excellent gift for anyone in your life that writes or journals. I know I would be thrilled to receive this myself.",1

Review: First a disclaimer: I bought these ""like new from Musicians friend"". They were clearly in immaculate condition. Still, it's on me for not buying with a warranty.<br /><br />Anyways, after a month or two there was a buzzing noise coming from the right channel, especially around B4 and B5, and also some in the bass. Then one day they just completely stopped working. They sounded and I loved them when the worked, but now I'm out 300 bucks. Take a look around internet forums for these things--you'll see there are a lot of similar complaints.

I wish I had got 2 more of a simpler version I also bought at the same time I bought these- it held up. I could have just googled the comfort level of humidity myself for when I use humidifiers in my babies rooms.

"Title: Great right out of the box!
Review: I had always used the basic Rico reeds that beginning students generally start out with. But I decided that after many years playing the clarinet, to try something a little different. In this case it was something a lot better! These reeds worked great right out of the box and did not need pre-wetting that many other harder reeds require.<br /><br />To me, the Rico Royal reeds didn't feel much different than the student Rico's but the quality of sound and how long they last were leaps and bounds better. The Royals didn't require blowing any harder to make them work but provided a richer more even tone throughout all the notes, even through the register barrier. I've had student Rico's die out after a time or two of use, but the Royals seem ",1
"Title: a captivatingly emotionally charged read
Review: As the little sister of his best friend, Summer Grace has always been off-limits to Jamie despite their attraction to each other.  Jamie’s indulged in his more extreme desires with a number of available women who enjoy the BDSM lifestyle – all while fantasizing about the one woman he wants most in this world.  Those fantasies quickly come to a head when he notices her at a New Orleans kink club and realizes her sexual interests coincide with his.  The trouble is that despite his intense feelings for Summer Grace, Jamie has some repressed emotional issues when it comes to loved ones and death and is afraid to allow himself to love anyone because love puts you at an emotional disadvantage.  Summer Grace, however, is impossible to resist.  She",1

They fit in my boys' carseat and stroller cupholders, the lids stay nice & secure (so you can actually allow your child to play with the full bowl if they need something to amuse themselves).

Tried this one by recommendation of my friend ( an intellectual, computer programmer that works in Manhattan) which was addicted to this game. Immediately I got addicted too, and can't stop playing.

So when I read the really bad consumer reviews of this recording, I was intrigued enough to order the album. What, I wondered, could Marcel Peres possibly have done to warrant this reaction?<br /><br />Although my undergraduate and graduate studies were in musicology, historical authenticity for me has always been merely a means, not an end in itself. I can derive enormous pleasure from anachronistic performances and have always maintained that musicianship trumps scholarship every time. So I looked forward to hearing what it was that sets this recording apart. Perhaps it would be delightfully quirky; a strikingly ",0

Review: I bought these bibs at a retailer.  I thought that they would work well, but they are terrible.  First, the plastic is stiff and does not drape over my baby at all, which means that it slides around all the time and food gets in under and around it.  Second, as others have said it is quite hard to clean, especially around the piping.  Third, the pocket is pretty much flush with the bib and therefore doesn't catch much.  Fourth, the bib is relatively short, which wouldn't be a problem if the pocket worked better.  Fifth, although waterproof plastic may seem like a good idea, in fact liquids just rolled straight down the bib and onto baby's lap.  For someone looking for a bib I would recommend a soft cloth bib with waterproof plasticized back",0

Even without inserting a filter, you have to inhale so hard to get a breath, and you'll start feeling light-headed pretty fast. If you put your hand in front of your face while wearing it and blow out, you'll feel literally nothing, so you can imagine how little air passes through the other way. I had my husband try it and he said the same thing - and he has much stronger lungs than mine. There are plenty of thick cotton masks and carbon filters that protect you and let you breathe. This one is unwearable - even for just a few minutes.",0
"Title: It was super easy to put together
Review: We used this to block off the TV console.  It was super easy to put together.  We have a weird living room set up, so one side is zip tied to a ridiculous rail that runs the length of the living room, and the other side is zip tied to the leg of the couch.  We also put the feet on that come with that.  This setup has held up rock steady and kept our kid from taking a header through the glass doors of the console, or getting to the TV, or slamming her fingers in the console.  Until she figures out how to climb on the couch and drop behind the gate, we are golden!",1
"Title: Baby you've been had
Review: This CD is designed to separate an unsuspecting Queen fan from his or her money. I think that the way it works is as follows: Someone with some mediocre quality recordings of some music somewhere puts it out on a nice CD and then it finds its way to a record store. The dedicated Queen fan who likes to collect everything that has to do with Queen sees it and recognizes many of the songs as being early Queen or Smile (1-7/14). Being a collector, he owns all of these songs on other CD's, but then he sees six more songs in the collection that he or she has never heard of (8-13). He figures that since this is a Queen CD they must have something to do with Queen. Perhaps they're early lost recordings, or maybe they're songs from some group that o",0
"Title: A Re-Release of the original ""ANUNA"" - FIVE STARS!
Review: WELL I MUST SAY I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF ANUNA SINCE I FIRST SAW THEM ON RIVERDANCE IN THE LATE NINETIES. ALTHOUGH I FELT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS ALBUM (ENTITLED ""ANUNA"" WITH A DIFFERENT PHOTO ON THE COVER) SUFFERED FROM PRODUCTION DEFICIENCIES, I CAN SAY THAT THEIR SUCCEEDING ALBUMS HAVE BEEN AMAZING. SOMEONE FINALLY REALIZED HOW TO FULLY EXPLOIT THE HEAVENLY, DEEPLY RICH AND FULL SOUNDS THAT THIS CHORAL GROUP CAN PRODUCE! THEIR VOCAL INTERPRETATIONS CHARACTERIZED BY OFTEN UNIQUE HARMONIC ORCHESTRATIONS ARE CONSISTENTLY EXCITING AND VIBRANT. WITH EACH ALBUM THEY JUST GET BETTER AND BETTER. THIS ALBUM IS NO EXCEPTION! IT IS A RE-RELEASE AND HAS DEFINITELY BEEN ""TWEAKED"" UP A LITTLE. A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO ANYONES MUSICAL COLLECTION AS ARE",1
"Title: Consider it straight!
Review: This Fagaci hair straightener is a great styling tool. The smooth titanium plates heat quickly, and DO NOT snag or pull your hair. The digital controls (power and temperature) are on the inside of the handle. The handles/arms seems a little short, but is extremely easy to grip and hold. I have thick, coarse shoulder-length hair and find that this flat iron is easy to use once I section my hair.  The cord rotates which makes it easier to control, and there is an automatic shutoff. It even comes with a holder (fabric/velcro) for storage or travel. And finally, for a mid grade flatiron, the price isn’t bad - approximately $70 on Amazon. Overall, this is a decent flatiron for the price.",1

Review: The crime, the victims, the perpetrater, all play their part in this saga of lies, murder and money.. Why, if the story is compelling, go into the sacred ceremonies of the church. They are painfully out of date of course, but these ceremonies are quite sacred and dear to faithful members of the church. The disclosing of these sacred promises does nothing to tell the dreadful tale of Hoffman and his evil deeds. It seems the authors had an agenda in addition to telling the true crime story of Hoffman, his victims, and the sleuths who put it together...",0
"Title: Disappointing
Review: I am very disappointed with this room spray and surprised that it's not the same quality as other Michel Design items I've purchased! The spray does not work no matter how much I tried. It's an aerosol spray in what resembles a 'can' and when the nozzle is pushed down the can makes a hissing sound and nothing comes out. Because of this problem it's impossible to tell how the fragrance smells, but it's supposed to be a cotton and linen smell. I bought this room spray from Michel Design because I've been very happy with their liquid hand soap and kitchen accessories. Unfortunately this room spray is not up to par with other products and I don't know if this is an isolated incident with the one I received or if it's a problem with them all. Si",0
"Title: Disappointed
Review: The fabric is pretty and has the potential to be great, but it’s not. • It’s loose fitting. I put it on and had to fight with both headset and eye mask to keep it from moving before I finally got my vr headset adjusted tight enough to keep the mask in place. I’m not petite, I’m 6’ with thick hair. It covers my ears. I can still hear from the vr speakers, but it’s just annoying that the fabric or stretchy band wasn’t made with EARS in mind. It didn’t matter how high or low I put the band on the back of my head. It was uncomfortable to try to put behind my ears. I ended up twisting the fabric once in front of each ear to free my ears. The part that goes over the nose seems useless. It’d probably stay better in place if there was a thing conne",0

Review: So bitterly disappointed! The only similarities between this perfume and the original Joy perfume are the name and the bottle. My wife has used and enjoyed Joy perfume for years. And although ""Forever"" was added to the name of this Joy, the bottle was the same and the label still showed Joy by Jean Patou . Unfortunately, there's absolutely no similarity.

Review: I am so surprised to have to write this negative review. I own other Polk products and have always considered them to be a top-notch manufacturer of decent stereo equipment. I purchased the Polk Magnifi-Mini after reading numerous glowing reviews and listening to it at BestBuy. After connecting to my tv my initial impression was wow it really sounded great and everything felt “Polklike” in terms of fit and finish. Not long afterwards however I noticed there was not even a hint of dispersion in my small listening space. Concerned that maybe I had not connected everything correctly I emailed Polk for assistance but my email was never responded to. After several days I called customer service and the information I was given was lacking in comm",0

Review: Bought this for my wife because these are the only shoes she can wear. They did not fit and the style was not what she expected so we requested a return from Amazon. They were not worn except to try them on so I printed the label and took them to Whole Foods. When I requested the refund I was told the amount would be refunded to the Amazon store card but after 5 days I did not see the refund. I gave them more time and still I did not see my refund, I called them, got someone in the Philippines who told me that my refund went to a gift card which Amazon did not inform me nor did they send me.

"Title: Make it at home before you invest
Review: Now I don't have coarse or curly hair, mine is fine, oily & short, but everyone should try this method before you invest in this 'cleansing conditioner':<br />In your palm put 1/2 the amount of shampoo you would normally use along with about the same amount you normally used for conditioner. Mix it together in your hands and then work it into your hair & scalp, then rinse well & done.<br /><br />My theory behind this product is that it is not magic, it just uses much less shampoo (guess we are all using too much shampoo) but it needs the conditioner to be the carrier for the shampoo which is why you have to use so much of the cream, or even wash it twice to get clean, grease free hair. I have oily hair and I would have to wash it twice with",0
"Title: Great mouse!
Review: I was worried since I only ready the bad reviews to see what people didn’t like about this mouse. I am a casual gamer so I don’t truly notice a difference or any latency between this laser mouse vs. an optical. I know the truth is that optical is superior but this mouse works great.<br /><br />It is also extremely comfortable for long gaming sessions.<br /><br />The connection seems so far to be consistent and reliable with no issues experienced so far.<br /><br />The RGB is incredible. There are more ways to setup the TGB functions than I think I will ever use but man is it fun to play with and watch. So far I have not experienced any problems with the mouses RGB or the way is works with Chroma Studio.<br /><br />Overall I find this mouse ",1

Review: I think I have every Wysocki Buffalo Games 300 puzzle.  Whenever I see one a new one I buy it.  My 93 yo Mom loves to do these puzzles.  This puzzle arrived yesterday and it is not the same quality.  Even the photo that accompanies the puzzle is half the size as before.  The pieces don't seem as big and are much thinner and hard to pick up.  The entire puzzle is a square instead of a rectangle.  This puzzle is going in the trash,  I hope it is not the new norm for Buffalo Games , which is always superior.  Thanks for reading.",0

Review: Ordered this as a gift and ended up keeping it for myself :) Packaged beautifully for a gift and their card is very professional as well. If you have sinus issues...the eye mask kept in the freezer is a must! I also have spasmodic torticollis/Dystonia...the shorter one (heated or cooled in the freezer) helps to relieve my nerve pain and muscle spasms. The long one I use for my curvature of the spine/scoliosis... I pop it in the microwave for a min and check to see if it is warm enough ( I like it HOT), if not...I heat for another min.

Review: Excellent. I miss John Thaw, but life goes on and these Inspector Lewis stories are top-of-the-line. I can't think of a better companion than Hathaway as acted by Laurence Fox. I have purchased the Blu-ray version, and my viewing soul is in love with the beautiful photography and the British scenery, so sharp and clear BR-style. I'm happy-dancing-pleased with this purchase, and I hope anyone who can afford to splurge on a little Brit-mysteries eye/soul-candy (this was a present from me to me!) will buy any of the Inspector Lewis seasons they can.

"Title: Someone just left the tape rolling.
Review: If you love Sun Ra and you are one of those people who like to own everything by your favorite artist and just partially listen to it one time and then put it on the shelf and be happy you have it in your collection, then this album is for you.  Me, I just can't buy into that position.  If something is bad, it is bad, no matter who made it.<br /><br />This is practice sessions and basic fooling around.  A lot of it is like a sound check or just warming up before a concert.  Some of it sounds like piano lessons. The music is just repetitive.  The same theme can just go on for 20 minutes.<br /><br />One portion is The Stripper them repeated over and over.<br /><br />Then there are some tracks with a phrase repeated over and over for about 10 ",0
"Title: Too many design flaws
Review: [[VIDEOID:86a8ffad602ba71146064b9a5c4a241e]] 1) The latches to open the bay doors are extremely difficult to open. You have to kind of push it down at an angle. It hurt my finger tips to try and get them open. If there is a trick to opening them, I didn't figure it out.<br /><br />2) There is a plastic part of the latch that is easily bent. When this happens, the doors won't close at all. Within 24 hours of owning this product, with minimal use, the far right latch no longer works. In fact, I can now slide the entire latch and the bottom part that is connected to it (the hard drive slides on to).<br /><br />I rarely make a video about a product, but I was so annoyed at this piece of junk that I decided to make a quick video before I returne",0

"Title: The best SF is published right here
Review: This is the magazine for the best stories on the market today.  A typical Hugo or Nebula awards list usually has several items from Asimov's (although not this year, they're all from sister publication Analog!)  Asimov's tends toward &quot;softer&quot; SF than Analog and some stories are more literary or experimental.  But I say this in praise, as most of these stories are well worth the effort.  Some really do take you to alien places or senses with their language and structure as well as plot (I'm thinking of some of Charles Stross' new entries).<br />Asimov's is less predictable than Analog as well; other than editor Robert Silverberg's editorial, there are few recurring features, and serialzed novels are rare.  So you may get two short ",1

Review: I had the previous version of the Orochi, and it was pretty good until the rubber feet started falling off. So I thought it was a no brainer to buy the 2013 model. I was wrong. It goes through a pair of double A's twice a week (I am a 18 hour a day user - the last one worked for a few weeks on a pair). When it reconnects to the computer via bluetooth, it connects at random sensitivities. Sometimes it is using all 6000 DPI and I can barely use it, sometimes it is unbearably slow. Often times it doesn't connect at all. I just booted into Linux and paired it there, now I booted back into windows and even though it as shown as connected, and I've turned it off and on several times, I have no motion from it.

"Title: I Believe There Is A Flaw In The Design of These Hip Hop Teeth
Review: There seems to be a fundamental flaw in the design of these &#34;hip hop teeth&#34; which I didn't notice when I ordered them.  If  you look at the second picture from the top of the Amazon site for this item, the teeth are facing the wrong way.  The way it is designed with the &#34;grillz and the holding bar&#34; on the back of these teeth, in placing them in your mouth you would have both the top and bottom set of teeth facing in the wrong direction. Instead of the teeth coming down from the top and going up from the bottom, they are in exact opposite, even if you reverse the top and bottom set of teeth. I have not melted the holding bar and tried them on yet, but you can see from the picture at the Amazon site and when you look at them i",0
"Title: Bad smell
Review: I prefer to leave positive reviews. However, this stuff smells like cat food, “cheese” that collects in private parts and some kind of plastic process. The reviews that mention the smell DO NOT go far enough with how terrible it is. It doesn’t “dissipate”. Furthermore, it sometimes stops natural body odor for the day - not 72 hours. The real price is smelling like another body odor and plastic combined.<br />I read the reviews that people are willing to put up with the “odd” scent for the deodorant abilities. But, isn’t an “odd scent” an odor???<br />I should have believed the words and not the stars.

Review: We recently moved to a new home in Florida.  As part of the moving process I have made a point of discarding old belongings we don’t use and organizing what we do.

Review: I received this Gibraltar 6608 drum throne for Christmas and after just six months of indoor use only in my home drum room, the metal legs pushed through the rubber feet.

This is unacceptable considering the Gibraltar 6608 model is advertised as a Heavy Duty drum throne.

"Title: Great Fit & Nice Quality Baseball Cap!
Review: I got this hat for my husband because he likes hats that have the mesh backing rather than just the material. This hat also has a snap type closure and not velcro which he also prefers. The hat is very sharp looking with the WPT emblem embroidered on the front as well as some design around it. All of the stitching is done very well. The hat is white and there were no marks on it when it came. The hat is the normal size of the hats he always wears and is not the smaller type that doesn't sit fully on your head.

"Title: No more sucking diesel out of a hose for me!
Review: I am not sure why it took me so long to get one of these and stop sucking up diesel out of a hose to fill the tractor, maybe tradition, lol,  Anyway, I absolutely love this pump, it makes it so easy to refill out tractors and farm implements with diesel and you dont even get any on your hands much less in your mouth.<br /><br />The pump is made of high quality materials and looks like it will survive even in the harsh world of our poultry operation.  It has lasted a few weeks so far and the farmhands haven’t broken it at all, that says a lot!",1
"Title: Soft and warm. Survived the washer and dryer with no problems
Review: I rotate our bedding twice a week  - with 7 dogs here, it doesn't take long for comforters etc to get a doggie scent.  That means washing and drying the comforters often. This one has been through the laundry twice now and so far it hasn't shrunk or thrown off any loose threads.<br /><br />The material is very soft and comfortable. I've used this one on 25 degree nights and it's warm. It's not terribly heavy and doesn't weigh you down through the night. I like the softer grey side - it looks nice and goes with any decor.",1

Review: Wonderful show. Great entertainment even 1/2 a century later.  I grew up on Mr. Rogers and so did all my friends and I'm just so pleased that I can now share these episodes with my own children.  All the 'children's' television programming today is complete trash and apart from completely banning my child from all TV related things....I can at least search out episodes like this that he can watch from time to time that he can enjoy without my needing to fear their content.  They are educational and Mr. Rogers has such a calm and peaceful nature.  Even now as an adult when I find myself upset with my child, I can summon (so to speak) the spirit of Mr. Rogers and respond to my child with a zen-like answer instead of loosing my cool.

Review: My bad & you get what you pay for. This treasure tractor bit my boys, the back 40 and even the base of my Goal Post while using the guard sober, slowly and utilizing plenty of light. It looked perfect including all those snappy appliance guards including nose & ear trimmers which I need in my fifties now. I screamed like a 5 yr old child and bled forever, or a few minutes but it was worse than a Man Cold and now I have PTSD. I'm going to invest more than $20 and look towards some Taj Majal Gator Groin CARE types of machines that treat me and my boys better. 1 Star and hundreds of tears.",0

Review: I'll admit it: I'm definitely a member of the intended audience for this book.  I'm guilty of almost all of the ""delaying tactics"" discussed in Chapter 3 (""Emotions and Resistance""); I've used most of the excuses in Chapter 7 (""No More Excuses"").  My home is cluttered with the artifacts of my life: books and music related to my academic pursuits, crafts supplies, cooking supplies and tools.  Basically, I'm just a few steps shy of making it to national television.<br /><br />I was offered a review copy of this book, and gladly accepted, eager to compare it to the other 6 or 7 books on the subject that I've collected.  It's not too long, but it definitely addresses the critical points in the complex emotional and physical task of making sense",1

Review: This potty is larger and more substantial than the four other baby potties scattered between my home and my daughters.  When the twins were younger, the Prince Lionheart and Precious Planet Froggy Friend were fine (and still are).  But with longer legs now, this higher, more stable potty works better.<br /><br />While the step stool aspect is a smart idea, I don't want them toting the potty around so we don't use it as a stool.<br /><br />I also don't use the baking soda freshener but it's fine that it includes it.<br /><br />I do like the wipes and find the holster convenient.<br /><br />Even without the baking soda, wipes, and step stool I would have given this potty five stars because it works so well at its main function.<br /><br />Thi",1

"Title: Horrible design flaws and quality.
Review: I was really displeased with this mounting set and the price.  These components can easily be assembled at a hardware store for 1/4 the price.  I recommend doing that and buying lots of spares, because the components quickly degrade with use; much faster than anticipated.  I used this particular kit on an 8&#34; circular plate that I first engaged with low velocity pistols, which showed little wear after about 250 rounds.  When I broke out the rifle, however, parts didn't last any time at all.  Even solid hits to the center left a shower of bullet fragments and had an impact strength that was tearing, bending and shattering parts from the mounting kit, but the plate had no wear.  By far the most annoying part was the bolt getting twisted or",0
"Title: Yea no. This is false advertising/marketing.
Review: I tried this product and 4 other variety packs from this brand. I was unhappy with all of them. Plum Organics, Happy baby, Gerber, and even Amazon Mama Bear brand products have better quality, taste, and texture.<br /><br />The number one thing to know about this variety pack is that it is primarily NAVY BEAN mixed with differing amounts of fruits and vegetables. This leads to most having similar tastes and much higher calorie content than competing 4-ounce pouches.<br /><br />All the sprout products I bought, this variety pack, and the three others also had a similar issue. They are poorly blended and not processed to the same standards as other brands. Stems, seeds, and fruit skins regularly make themselves seen and felt. Things like Kiwi",0

"Title: The Lavario is My Choice!
Review: Hello everyone. I just  finished my first load with the Lavario (one pajama bottom,  three teeshirts, three pairs of socks, and a pair of Levi’s).  I chose the Lavario because it is very stable on the ground and you can stand while using it. Other brands have suction cups to hold them down which don’t always work.  Also, you have to bend over to use them if you don’t put them on something.  The Lavario works great.  I would highly recommend it!  I also used a wringer which I’ve had for some time.  It’s great for quicker drying times and ease of use compared to hand wringing.  I would recommend using a wringer also.  Anyway, I’m  very happy with my purchase!  Happy washing!",1

"Title: Line breaks every few feet.
Review: The big problem with using this as an edger is that the line does not feed.  It breaks and like many, many people have said, you have to take the cap off, pull out the spool, try to find and dig out the end, feed it back without the spool unravelling, place the cap back on.  In a few feet the whole process has to be repeated.  I don't know who designed this, or who tested it, but they should go back to &#34;how to build an edger school&#34;.  Ultimately I left it out on my tree belt hoping someone would save me the cost of paying the city to dispose of it, however there were no takers.<br />This product is an American built shame.

"Title: Dim Light, Odd Purple Cast
Review: Just remodeled the guest bath with a new vanity three light fixture, gray wall color, white cabinets and granite top.  I wanted good lighting which is why I chose 800 lumens vs the usual 750.  I also chose 3000K to avoid the yellow cast produced by 2700K bulbs.  First, I was surprised by how dim they were.  I was not using a dimmer switch, just a regular on/off toggle.  These bulbs also gave off a strong purple cast making everything in the room look purple.  I knew immediately these were not going to do the job.<br /><br />I swapped them out for Energetic 3000K 750 lumen non-dimmable LED bulbs also purchased from Amazon.  These gave off at least twice as much light, and no weird color cast.  These will do the job nicely.<br /><br />I have ",0
"Title: WAS Great Stuff:  an Update
Review: My absolute favorite flavor is &#34;Sweet and Hot&#34;:  in my experience, it's the most flavorful as well as most tender.  Normally, I buy this Pounder on Walmart.com:  never a bad bag in all the years I've purchased it.  But the last time I bought it there, it was $10.98/bag:  now it's $15.95/bag there.  So I took a chance buying from Amazon because this was a great deal, and I'm happy to announce that the 10 bags I received today are perfect (at least from what I can see through the window of the other nine; the one I opened is excellent!).  Expiration date on all bags is 8/5/2019, so unless I find a random moldy bag, I'm really happy I took the chance and so is my dog! : )  PS:  When I look at reviews on Amazon, I look at &#34;Recent Re",0

"Title: Dress was delivered with a tear in it...
Review: I received this dress very quickly, and I am very pleased about that. However, the dress is a different color red than displayed in the picture. I can not make an observation of how the dress fit because I noticed a large tear at the seam before I could try it on. I did not want it to tear anymore. This dress is a very thin delicate fabric, and I am certain that if it didn’t already have a tear in it when it arrived, that it would fall apart the first day I wore it. The lining is very cheap. This dress reminds of the princess costume dresses you can buy a child in a grocery store during Halloween. I am returning this dress, and will not reorder it.

The bumper is the exact length of her crib mattress and we use a regular sheet (not a deep one), which fits over the bumper and mattress, but is snug.

I called Bose customer service and said I had a question about my new Bose headphones. She said “I’m sorry, I can’t hear you clearly” I said I know, because I’m calling using my new Bose headphones.

Review: Unfortunately, I have just had to throw the ironing board cover in the trash. I'm beginning to wonder if I received the same one as others, because the silicone coating began to wear away immediately. My cover was a pale purple at first, and it quickly began to fade to a sickly gray. It still worked well, so I wasn't going to quibble over cosmetic looks. But a scorch mark appeared recently, and was leaching onto my fabrics when I attempted to iron them.<br /><br />I am not hard on my irons, nor careless with ironing or the care of my fabrics.

Ill go ahead and start with the positives. The band was in a nice looking package and it was easy to install to the apple watch. Thats it for the positives. So first off this is not genuine leather. Not even close. Its got a very rubbery plastic feel. Definitely a very synthetic leather. Secondly the ""metal"" strap connections are also not even close to being actual metal. They are about as plastic as you can get. The feeling when you attach the strap to the watch just feels gross. Given that this is faux leather and has plastic attachments I just cant imagine it",0

Review: I have a trigger finger which gets uncomfortable every time I open and close my hand.  I was reading that in lieu of surgery it is good to give it a rest so it isn't so painful.  This splint holds it in place so I can move the rest of my hand without the annoying and painful trigger finger getting in the way.  It feels comfortable as it has a nice tail on the palm side of the splint that protects the edge of the splint from digging into your hand.  There is one very annoying thing that you have to deal with as soon as you get this.  There is a sharp ridge at the melted seam of each Velcro strap.

"Title: Excellent quality cable, nice and long; a little on the pricey side
Review: You can never have enough USB cables, especially this type with the mini end on it, as most devices these days use this size.  What I especially like about this one is the length.  It is nearly 10 feet long (3 meters), so what you are plugging in can be some distance from your computer.  I also liked the fact that the cable is wrapped in braided nylon, so it seems very durable so it doesn't seem like it will kink up or easily wear out.  It claims fast changing capability, but I am not sure that it charged my smartphone any faster than any other cable.  The only downside that I can see at all is that this cable is rather pricey.  The price is somewhat justified by the length and quality of the cable.  If you want the best, buy this one and y",1

It was sad watching Joseph letting anger get the best of him while we know him to be the “terror of demons” bc of his ability for self control, humility and charity. Seeing Mary and Joseph act like love struck teens were offensive to say the least.

Just because it's controversial and shocking does not mean it gets a pass on its other attributes.  Bad is just bad.

Review: Had a screeching gas dryer for a couple of weeks before I decided to finally fix it. I knew it had to be one of the wheels or the pulley, so I just ordered this set which was a good price for the pulley, two drum support wheels and a new belt. Once I opened the dryer up I saw that one of the wheels had completely worn out its center bushing and was disintegrating. The thin washer between the circlip and the wheel had completely disintegrated, and since this kit did not come with a washer, I ended up putting on the circlip without a washer and I hope this holds up. I was also glad I got the kit because the other wheel was showing signs of wear as was the pulley and the belt. Probably get a few more years out of this dryer for a small investm",1

I guess I could have received a defective one, but then again a friend of mine also reports the same. He is having to measure himself 2 times (the second time is where he claims it is right).<br />My claim of inaccuracy comes from the scale returning different values when you step on/off multiple times in a sequence.

Review: i've purchased two of these, both failed, neither were warrantied. the last one i purchased fewer than six months ago, i am over it. I will calibrate and immediately after, while it is STILL IN THE SOLUTION From being calibrated, it will show a different number. The meter needs to be calibrated every day, and sometimes more than once a day. I cannot have faith in the numbers. But most frustrating is that they do not honor the warranty, they just tell you things to try and when those don't work they are out of ideas.",0
"Title: Thick and strong
Review: I prefer this type of sunshade, and so was pleased to find a similar one selling on Amazon. The color is close to that of the illustration. The windshield arrived well-packaged and included the suction cup. We have a similar sunshade in our mid-sized SUV, have been using it for more than 4 years, and it's held up well. We're using this new one in a short bed truck. Neither shade was made for our exact vehicles, and I'm fine with that. I just fold over one section so that it fits the SUV better. We don't bother with the suction cup, but some people might prefer using it.  I recommend this sunshade and would purchase it again.",1

Review: I am glad that this product works for some people. I tried this disc on two computers and it did not work on either one.<br /><br />I don't have a problem with that. It was in an open box without instructions so that is a hint and a half. The big problem for me is that you cannot contact the company unless you pay $9.00 at justask.com  Who ever heard of paying a company for help in using their product?<br /><br />I don't hate the program.

"Title: Oracal 651 is the Gold Standard
Review: What can I say? This product is the best out there. I use tons of vinyl for my Silhouette Cameo and I exclusively use Oracal 651 for my projects. Once it has cured for a couple days it is acid free, permanent outdoor vinyl and I have bumper stickers that I have made for myself in the harsh climate of Anchorage, Alaska and they're taking it like a champ, 4 years and counting.<br />The rolls are 12&#34; wide and the colors are true to what you see here. Generally, when you order, your order will be cut from a larger roll so it is important to specify which colors you would like and they will usually arrive in a box rolled up together. Personally, I separate and roll them into individual tubes secured with MASKING TAPE for easiest storage. Oth",1

Review: Begging Amazon to please carry Chiquita!!!<br /><br />I buy these bananas because I no longer go to the grocery store and do a lot of my shopping through Amazon fresh - there’s no other option but these… The reviews are absolutely 100% correct. These are the worst bananas ever to grow and be picked off a banana tree in the history of bananas. They do take upwards of two weeks to ripen with no indicator of ripening other than the fact that they’ve softened. I’ve had to throw away bunches here n’ there and buy them two at a time w/ time for previous batches to ripen. I’ve never had to be so strategic about buying bananas ever in my life. The only reason I bother is because of the current environment we’re living in being so uncertain in terms",0

Ordered the kit at 3 am Monday , installed at 5pm Tuesday, problem solved . Gapped at .32 .  Time will tell but the plugs (ngk) and coils seem well made .

"Title: Great buy!
Review: Did a load of laundry as soon as I got it. The faucet adapter hook up only took a minute.  It is bigger than I thought and it fit a blanket that my old portable washer could not fit.  The water does not fill up to the top, but I saw that in the reviews before I got it so I am okay with that.  Very quiet, love that it controls the water flow,  I recommend doing a quick wash about 25 minutes as opposed to regular wash which was about 65 minutes.  That is too long for such small loads.  When you open the lid during the cycle it buzzes and won't stop until you shut the lid and hit the start button again.  I think this is a safety feature if there are children in the home.",1
"Title: Totally satisfied. Great well thought out, quality guitar case at a low price.
Review: Great guitar case for the money. It is well thought out. My old bag cost more than 2x this one. It was not heavily padded, this one stands on its own. This has extra protection over tuner and bridge so strings dont cut bag. My old one did not. Inside tore apart then white stuffing fell into classical tuners and got in gears. It opens all the way around the other was 2/3 which made it hard to get guitar in and out.  Loved the 2 outside zippered storage areas. Friend saw it, loved it and will be ordering one.",1

I am addicted to beets and I dont know why, lost 15 pounds in 3 weeks, I eat palm tree hearts for lunch, tomato soup with little spoonful of sour cream, low sugar almond milk, water, in between meals. Anyways back to the beets, they are a great brand made by Whole Foods in the lonestar state....

Anyways these beets are awesome.",1
"Title: Julia's Wigs Were Hot Messes, But The Film Is Good.
Review: Even looking beat down and pale, Julia Roberts can't get away from looking like Julia Roberts, but A for effort.  Nice twist at the end.  Great cast and should not be compared to &#34;the original.&#34;  Chiwetel does an outstanding job, and Nicole Kidman...well, she did well, too, being Nicole Kidman.  I think I even saw her forehead move once or twice.<br /><br />I'm giving this one 5 stars just because it's got to be better than watching Julia in that red bob wig in &#34;Mother's Day.&#34; I don't think I can sit through that one, so I'll give all my Julia love and praise to this one.  One world of advice, Julia:  Please glam it up again and perm up and dye red that &#34;Pretty Woman&#34; hair again. You know that's the only way people w",1
"Title: but it definitely has the tomatillo flavor and a great taste of cumin
Review: This Pace Ready Meal was surprising to me because it was so tasty. In fact, it reminded me very much of a chicken, tomatillo soup I make. This was closer to a thick stew instead of a soup, but it definitely has the tomatillo flavor and a great taste of cumin. The chicken was in pieces large enough to actually identify as were the corn and the red and green peppers; the starch is white rice.<br /><br />This pouch is prepared by placing it in your microwave, unopened, for 60 seconds. You then remove it by gripping the 'stay cool' sections of the top, cut across the top and eat out of the pouch or pour the contents into a bowl. The fiesta chicken stayed warm for the entire time it took me to eat it from the pouch. There are 230 calories in the",1

Review: Full of Intrigue, fun, Love, Friendship & the Dark Side Of Politics! This volume has so much going on as we pick up right where Volume Two left off. These characters are fast becoming my favorite with their great friendships and trust in one another.  Loved watching Skyler and Parker relationship turn the corner into more as these two become more in tune with how the other thinks and feels, while also sharing and trusting each other. Their sizzling encounters are some of my favorite scenes. I can’t wait to read the final volume as I am so invested in this group of characters.

"Title: Not great and not easy to use.
Review: 1) the battery power is not as strong as the USB plug. So if you need mobility to get to your dogs teeth or don't have a nearby outlet, it is very annoying.<br />2) to turn it off, you have to hold the power down for a ""long hold"" and then to turn it back on, you have to cycle through all the slow speeds to get to the fast speed. It doesn't remember what speed you were at. So when you reload the toothpaste, it takes 4 clicks to start up again which is also very annoying.<br /><br />Not worth $30.",0
"Title: It's Pink Floyd.  Blu-Ray version.
Review: The only difference between this and the DVD version, as far as the concert goes, is that the concert is continuous on one disc.  There is an intermission in the middle of the concert... don't know why.  Video quality isn't much different.  It's looks just like the DVD.  The sound is good.  The second BD disc contains extras... which were worth it for me.  The 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder' BD release looked far better for it's release, given that it was shot on film and not video.<br />I recieved mine with some damage to the outer case because the box it was shipped in was damaged at the fulfillment center or from the shipper.  That shipping box was made for this box set and it slips right over the BD set.  Just a fore-warning.",1
"Title: Damages Jewelry
Review: Damages your jewelry. Doesn't clean any better than toothpaste and toothbrush. But the worst part is the English directions.  It wasn't until it ruined a sentimental pair of earrings that I realized what the comment 'Unfirmly inlaid studs on decorations may shed off during cleaning'. Gemstones fell out of my earrings and it wasn't until I emptied the water, and the loose gems went down the drain, that i realized what had happened. So any jewelry with attachments is at risk of being destroyed. I hate this. There's no chance of repair for these earrings, no compensation. Thank goodness I can return this piece of schizzle. The first photo is the ruined earrings. The second is a piece of jewelry that was run through two cleaning cycles, the sec",0

Review: The box was damaged with a large hole in the side, but everything inside looked ok.  Though the instructions are little more than pictures, I was able to put everything together fairly quickly until it came to attaching the back to the ridiculous bottom attachment of the seat.  Somehow you must precariously balance the backplate to line up in the slot but there is nothing that helps hold the back in place as there is a large gap.  I have tried every single way of propping the pieces together so the holes line up but since I don't have 2 other people or 4 extra hands, this is an impossible feat. I removed the arms but that didn't help as nothing lines up. I went to the website for support, and the link for support says ""coming soon?  Chat wi",0

I bought item a couple of months ago. I made the mistake of only playing it till recently. And found out the center channel is missing. No vocals at all. It actually broke my heart. I was looking forward to one of the best albums of our time. Only to be let down by faulty reproduction.

"Title: The container is half full, spinach is lackluster
Review: The container is just about half full, perhaps just a touch more .If the product were fresh in a grocery store, it's clear that it wouldn't be acceptable as a product suitable for resale.  My guess is that many of the leaves were yellow when this product was dried as the container is comprised of some light green spinach with a great deal of light brown wood colored flakes and stems. I'll use this for soups and I did today so I can't comment much on the taste, it seems fine.  My expectation was to get a quality food item that is okay for long-term storage and acceptable as a low cost substitute when I can't use fresh spinach fast enough. What was delivered was a product that is simply not worth it in terms of value. My impression was honest",0
"Title: Amazing Poetry!!
Review: Alexander Pushkin has been considered to be the greatest of all Russian poets.  Indeed, I believe he's the greatest poet ever.  He was the father of the modern Russian,  and better than any other poet had shown the beauty and versatility of this language.  His poems appear to be effortlessly composed, yet their flair and grace is unsurpassed.  One really needs to understand Russian to fully appreciate these great poems, but this album allows others to get the feel for the amazing musicality of Pushkin's verses.  Dimitri Hvorostovsky certainly possesses the goods for this kind of stuff: his sweet, mellow baritone and fantastic diction brings out the best in these songs.  Add to this the virtuoso playing of Ivari Ilja and you have almost a pe",1

Review: The table folds, the chairs stack, it is attractive....<br /><br />However the metal used on the chair frames (the metal you can't see because it is covered by rattan weaving) must not be the right kind of metal for outdoor use. The first time the chairs got wet rusty liquid began pouring from between the rattan. Leaving rust stains all over my patio. This was in less than two weeks of owning it. I don't even know how something rusts that quickly but it did.<br /><br />I have seen similar chairs at my local hardware store, I am probably going to get some to replace these, the table is holding up fine,  The metal legs on the table do not leak.<br /><br />I've included some pictures.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.",0

Review: The quality is a complete and utter garbage. I have ordered 5 of these and received 2 so far. On both of these two battery box is broken, rendering the lights useless. Considering that these should be able to be used outdoors, I do not see how this would even be possible with such flimsy non-weatherproof battery boxes. The boxes are just super thin plastic panels. On one, the lock was broken, with pieces of it inside the box. On the other, even better - battery contact plates literally shot out of the box once I inserted the batteries. Only order these if you would like to have a bunch of pretty but useless plastic flowers. Otherwise - STAY AWAY.

"Title: Love Behringer, but not the Xenyx 502
Review: I really like Behringer gear, but am very disappointed in this. I use it to mix the signal from my electric bass and from my laptop so I can practice in my headphones. There are two reasons why I give it a low review. First, the power source fits EXTREMELY loosely into the back of the unit--so much so that I would never trust it in a live situation. It falls out on its own ALL the time. All of a sudden, power off! I need to lean the unit against other objects just to get it to stay in. Second, the noise level is completely unacceptable. I haven't measured it, but there is no way you could record something coming through this mixer. It's really bad. I believe it is somewhere in the main mix, as the noise is present even with the individual c",0

The build quality is excellent (especially considering the price point), there’s loads of adjustability, and there are a number of excellent design touches that make it a pleasure to use.<br /><br />The fabric is thick, and feels like canvas even though it is mostly (entirely?) made of nylon. All the stitching is tight and even, and all the stress points are double or triple stitched. The velcro is also well attached, and is the thick, sturdy type that holds tight.

Review: I Absolutely love Dunkin Donuts coffee but generally speaking, I dislike most K-Cups due to weak flavor and product waste.  However, I received a K-Cup coffee maker for Christmas and I really like Dunkin coffee so I purchased this. Sadly it was absolutely a waste of money.  The coffee is weak and flavorless, The box is big enough for 12 K-Cups yet they only give you 10 in each.  Comparably you are paying for ten at the cost of a dozen with other brands.  6oz of water is the only way you can taste the coffee flavor and for two full cups of coffee you have to use 4 of these.  What an absolute shame.  If you want to actually taste the coffee, buy McCafe original with these, you can make a 10oz cup with 1 K-cup and there are 12 in a box.  What ",0

I sprayed them with cooking spray, dipped them in flour and even sprayed the top of the chilled dough with cooking spray and a sprinkle of flour.

I pressed all four of them into the dough and then proceeded to try to pull them out.

I was impressed by Glenda Farrell in a movie called Mystery of the Wax Museum, and I usually like old mysteries, so when I found out she played a crime-solving reporter in a series of comedy mysteries, I ordered the Torchy Blane collection.  The first one was just okay, but they went downhill fast and by the fourth one I was so irritated that I swore never to watch another Torchy Blane movie.  The basic promise is simply that she is a girl reporter, engaged to a police detective who isn't all that bright, and loves using one of the other unbelievably stupid cops to get information she is not supposed to have.  She appears to have no morals or ethics and in one case -- spoiler alert -- she actively interferes with a",0

Review: These treats arrived at my house in a big plastic bag, with zero extra protection, and they were absolutely pulverized.  I see now they're showing a picture of the actual bag.

It was unfortunate because I essentially paid for 14 ounces of dust and 2 ounces of actual treat.<br /><br />The treats themselves, which I assumed to be 100% salmon, are not (there was no ingredient list pictures when I ordered).

We decided to let her get it and when we got it and read through it a little first, we decided not to let her have it. This book almost promotes kids cutting themselves and kind of gives the impression that it’s an ok way of releasing anger or hurt and normalizes it.

"Title: Buy anything else.
Review: It has honestly been awhile since I have been this disappointed with a product.  Yes, the price is low and that will have an effect on quality, but the item I received was difficult to put together and did not have the correct parts (see the photo).  First of all, the wrenches included do not fit the nuts attached to the screws. I have other wrenches, so that was a non-issue for me.  However, I feel like that might be a much more significant issue for someone without tools at home.  The absolute deal breaker was when, after 30 minutes of dealing with how absolutely finicky this thing is to put together, I realized that I was missing the second half of the handle and instead had an extra bottom piece.  I'm sure it's fine if you have the corr",0
"Title: Defective Product- Did Not Work
Review: I bought this item as a gift for my niece's birthday. When she opened it up and we put in the batteries, the game did not work. I went online to return it today and saw that the return period was over. I am horribly disappointed with this purchase. It is defective and I should receive a new product since this one does not work at all. Talk about a let down to a 5 year old. I was really excited to play this game with her, as I had had so much fun playing it as a kid. Now I'm out cash and out a birthday present for my niece.",0
"Title: PERFECT For Small Loves Of Paleo Bread (Grain Free)
Review: When it comes to bread, a small pan is ridiculous.  The family is all over it and it is gone before it even cools off.  However, I have a need to make paleo bread once in a while and that involves a lot of nut flour, activated nuts and seeds, eggs, and a few other things.  I wanted a small loaf pan.  Let's see how this went.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This pan is the small cube with the ridges in it.  The top slides on.  There is a hole in the bottom for air release.  The inside and outside is a beautiful champagne gold color.  The surface is definitely stick free and the metal underneath is steel.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS WORK?<br />Because I was not making typical yeast bread, I put down a layer of waxed paper on the bottom of the",1
"Title: comedy of life
Review: Most sports movies, not so much; and maudlin movies about dying young, not so much either.  There is just the right amount of baseball screen time, especially when they are winning.  It seems silly to say DeNiro's character is a funny saint, but he becomes one in the eyes of his team.  And for anyone who feels humiliated in their job-no one is worthless.  Extraordinary, humble acting here.  Usually famous actors are all you are aware of on screen, but even knowing these actors all these years later, the characters still take over the story.  The interplay between players and players, players and head office, players and family, doesn't seem slow to me at all.",1
"Title: Do not buy for an aquarium! Inaccurate readings! Company tried to bribe me to take this review down.
Review: This reader bounces all over the place. 6.2 ph to 8 ph is a huge difference for fish and can mean life or death for some species. I was having an issue with the ph in my tank and bought this so I didn't have to use the drop kit. This gives inaccurate readings all over the place. I expected because it was advertised for aquariums it would give a steady reading. Wrong! Do not buy for aquariums!<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />The company reached out to me after my review. They tried to bribe me to take my review down. This is me declining. As a fish keeper, my review is highly important to warn other fish keepers not to use this product, especially since it could be the reason for the death of a fish. And the fact that it is advertised as an aqu",0
"Title: Not accurate. So disappointing.
Review: I am so disappointed by this thermometer, which makes me sad because I was really excited to get it in the mail!<br /><br />It is not accurate in the least. I compared the readings to the Braun ear thermometer and a rectal thermometer when my 10 month old was running a fever and it consistently read too high. If it was a consistent number of degrees high, I would do the math muself, but it never gives the same reading twice. Therefore, I cannot rely on it for an accurate reading.<br /><br />The worst part is that it is not returnable. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one free of charge, in hopes that mine was just malfunctioning. Unfortunately, I now have two thermometers that I cannot trust.<br /><br />I wanted this to work so bad",0

Review: Birmingham based punk band.  Always had fun watching this group play.  Hope the last album Kosher will someday go to print.  This band had Shannon Madden, cousin to the Madden brothers from Good Charlotte and Ronald Presley, cousin to Lisa Marie Presley and Elvis, punking it out here in Birmingham, Alabama from 1992-1995 until 2008 {Original band name was Bone Yard}.  They usually played in Birmingham at the Nick, High Note, Cave 9 and they loved to play at Meridian Underground and the Princess Theatre in Mississippi.  Check out their site at [...] .

Review: I downloaded the free version to determine if it's what I need to transfer photos from my PC to a CD and/or DVD. It appeared to install correctly and gave me the option to upgrade or run the free version. I launched the free version, it initialized the burning disk process and a new screen, with options for what function to perform, e.g., data disk, video disk, etc. to CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc. I chose Photo Gallery Disc to DVD. A new screen loaded; after the cursor spinned for a few seconds, the systems told me the software was ""not responding"" and I had to close it or wait for the program to respond. To close it, a message was ""allegedly"" sent to Microsoft; to wait just activated the spinner again that led to a non responsive notice.<br /",0

Review: quoted from MusicWeb review:<br /><br />Brilliant Classics should not be surprised if they elicit enquiries from their local Trading Standards office regarding this disc. Not only are two thirds of the disc taken up by material previously released by Brilliant only two years ago - a five CD boxed set of Gilardino's complete (60) Studies in Virtuosity & Transcendence (Brilliant Classics 8886) - but the so-called &#34;Sardinia Chamber Orchestra&#34; is, incredibly, synthesized: while Porqueddu's guitar in the Concerto di Oliena is real, the orchestral parts are computer-generated! And do Brilliant state this on the disc? No. In fact, the Orchestra is not listed or otherwise mentioned once in the documentation. On the Brilliant website then? W",0

"Title: This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it
Review: This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it. The rangerfinder will still fit into its case, even after putting this on. The magnets are so strong that the rangefinder will not budge when it is placed on the steering column or metal frame of a golf cart, even if the cart violently bumps as it goes over a bridge (or due to hazardous driving). The one thing to note is that it is much easier to leave the rangefinder behind after a round of golf if you are not paying attention. I would make sure to put the rangefinder (or its case) in a very visible place to make sure you do not forget it after an exuberant (or miserable) round.",1
"Title: Doesn't clean.
Review: Uses a teaspoonful per gallon of water.  No need to rinse. Sounded great, since these days I'm washing my clothes in the sink rather than use the communal washing machines. I had used a conventional liquid soap before this product and it worked very well. This product is utterly without merit. Some of my cotton clothes had a rank moldy odor after they dried and no, they didn't smell before being washed.<br />The idea that this product cleans at all is pure power of suggestion.

Review: I last wrote a review on the Voyager Edge. I returned it and the sellers said it was faulty. I think it was just crap. I got this 5200 as a replacement.<br />Fit: Not bad. Hooks around the ear but it can still easily fall off if you lean your head to the side. It does come loose and the earpiece doesn't fit snug in my ear 100%, but good enough to be happy.<br />Audio: excellent.

Review: I purchased this top burner nob for my GE Cafe Series Gas Range. Unfortunately, it did not fit.  The deadline for returning it had passed, so I was unable to return it. Other people had reviewed this item and said that it did not fit. Perhaps the manufacturing tolerance levels are not that high for this item. I was able to re-drill it so that it fit in my gas range, but I should not have to. On the plus side, I was glad to see the reinforcement sleeve on the item, since they used cheap metal that breaks easily.",0
"Title: The Razor that cuts away the competition
Review: It is such a simple idea. Take a manual razor and an electric razor and create a hybrid electrical manual razor at a cheap price. Forget about buying any kind of electrical razor or manual razor again. This thing works using a single AAA battery (and is worth investing in some rechargable AAA batteries) which slips into the base by pulling out the end piece. Just press the green button and the razor starts to vibrate. This vibration stimulates the skin and gets those hairs to prick up a little bit so that razor blades (all three baldes, i.e - Mach III/M3) catch better creating a cleaner smoother cut. To be honest the old Mach III model was absolutely great but the M3 Power razor just upgrades that razor into a totally new device. There is s",1

A thirteen year old mute girl who lost her entire family in a hurricane is raped, after wearing hand me down party dresses of a rich girl.<br />The two main characters turn on each other and destroy one another’s hopes and dreams.<br />Overall the book is terribly depressing and I would not waste my time reading it.

"Title: Perfect pizza cuts at home!
Review: We love this. Not only is this great for DIY homemade pizza, but my kids are too young to eat whole slices from our local pizzeria, so we often cut them into half slices at home. Using a knife that is too sharp punctures the box while one that is too dull messes up the cheese and ruins the pizza- this is JUST right! Does a perfect job and the slices come out just the way we wanted!<br />Cleaning it is a little bit more complicated than a standard knife, but I think that's true of all pizza slicers in this style. Be careful not to cut yourself, and you'll be great!",1

Review: I can't speak to the beneficial effects that a salt crystal lamp may have on my sleep, inner tranquility or my chi, but it's  a very nice night light for the bedroom. The intensity is supposed to have something to do with the level of expected results or the like, but it creates a nice warm glow and you can bring it up or down to fit the environment. It's also heavy enough that you could probably brain a burglar if you hit them with it, so there's that, too. Comes in any color you like as long as it's orange, and doesn't make any noise. Two thumbs up.",1
"Title: light gentle rinse off cleanser, or wipe off, OR use as make up base
Review: As part of their Age Rebel line, Shor Cosmetics Liquid Cream Milk cleanser is designed for face cleansing and make-up removal, and preparing skin for subsequent treatment. It can also be used as a make up base or lightener. It has has a very light, pretty scent. The fluid is white with low viscosity- more liquid than cream. It can be used with water, or without. The latter option is nice for people who have sensitivities to tap water, or who have very dry skin.<br /><br />So, massage a generous amount into the skin. I aim for 30-60 seconds. Rinse (OR just wipe off). This helps break down any grime of the day. I am used to ""double cleansing"", so after I rinse this off, I do it all again. For me it does a fair job of cleaning the skin of make",1

Review: DO NOT waste your time. This is soo not what I wanted or thought it was.  If you want more clutter and a way to procrastinate, buy this book  It is a therapy book.  Why do you keep clutter?

Review: The thermometer did not work right.  It was confused with the indoor and outdoor readings.  It only gave me the indoor reading and not the outdoor reading.  The probe wire was kind of short.  It will not reach the front of the car.  One of the + is that you did not need to run a power cable because it used a battery and also you can turn it on and off to save on the battery consumption.<br /><br />On the other hand when I had a problem they contacted me soon and gave me a refund promptly.  They are a good group to work with and would do business in the future.  Give the thermometer a try and maybe you will have better luck.",0

Review: I have been looking for some good solid book ends which do not take up too much room yet will hold up larger books.  Let's take a look at these..<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These book ends are heavy metal.  They are a really pretty bright navy if that makes sense with a little bit of cyan mixed in (your printer ink blue is cyan if you have inkjet color).  These come very well wrapped in a bubble mailer so they are not chipped or scratched.  They have the deer cut out from the metal and there are four little pads on the bottom to keep them from scratching or moving when holding up books.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE WORK?<br />When I got these, I ran right to my bookcase and put them in.

"Title: Easiest EQ small capsule microphone I've ever worked with!!
Review: I mix front of house sound for a 600 seat church several times a month; I've also mixed front of house sound in many other venues for many years. This microphone is the most forgiving head worn microphone I've ever worked with. Not only does it stay in place without the need to tape it down with surgical tape, it's nearly invisible, and it's sensitivity and dynamic range is exceptional, but it is also the most forgiving to EQ I've ever experienced.  It produces a full, true, warm sound identical to the speaker using it, with no hassle!<br /><br />Other manufacturers products I've worked with, usually priced much higher than this one, just don't compare. It is the favorite microphone in my church's inventory; hands down! I'd recommend this m",1
"Title: YES - it works on a '08 Element!
Review: Cross referenced the serial number on the original receiver, and it was a perfect match. All my locks were fine, but bought the car recently - NO REMOTES. So, I priced them out. With all the aftermarket ones getting negative reviews, decided to get the entire kit. For the transmitters/receiver, it didn't cost that much more.<br /><br />The box and instructions state its for a CR-V, but it worked with my Element just fine. I would imagine any 03-11 Honda that has a regular immobilizer key would be compatible.<br /><br />Took about a minute and a half to replace/install the new one. And the remotes didn't even need programming. Works great! Only problem I'm having is figuring out how to get the doors to auto lock after accelerating past 10mph",1

It's a fun world building game with great graphics (which unfortunately eat a lot of kindle battery, but worth it).  I also appreciate that the developers upgrade the game every now and then, adding more buildings, new stuff to do, etc.  To that end, I'd like to make a couple of suggestions.  The most annoying thing is &quot;a townie can't reach his destination&quot;, over and over, especially when you have roads and bridges all over the place.

Fortunately I had planned ahead and purchased 4 of these dollies. While the pool table was on the trailer, we used a jack to lift each end and slip a dolly under each leg. We slipped a board under the dollies on the first end to prevent it from moving while we jacked the other end and placed the dollies. We created a sturdy ramp from our trailer to the garage and made sure it was well braced so it wouldn't slip as we cautiously started to roll the table off.

Review: My daughter is two days shy of 4 months old and just started chewing on Sophie's ears/antlers/mouth yesterday. I noticed the rubber is ALREADY peeling back on the antlers area, and also on two of the legs. Very concerning, last thing I need is my daughter swallowing a chunk of rubber. It's not just peeling a tiny bit either, it's a good size chunk. I really wanted to like this toy, I heard great things about it, but to me I cannot see how this is even remotely safe...The seams of the toy are choppy so I understand how the rubber is peeling back so easily, it simply is not safe and poorly constructed. Would never recommend this to anyone with an infant. My daughter doesn't even have a single tooth yet and wasn't chewing on it very rough, so ",0

Review: This is an interesting product. It comes in this two-ended lipstick. One side has the actual liquid lipstick in it that on its own is very sticky. The applicator is very nice and allows you to nicely apply the lipstick onto your lips. The color is stunning and I for one really like this one. It has some golden sparkles in it too to give it a little extra.<br /><br />On the other side is a clear ""sealer"" that you apply over the lipstick once it is fully dried. This seals it all up and makes this stay where it is supposed to stay. It is some sort of balm that just has magic powers of sorts. This duo works though and will last for as long as you need it to.

"Title: Will not create proper flares if you're using a Titan flare tool
Review: I was very hopeful this product would work for my brake lines after reading about how easy NiCopp was to work with vs stainless steel for the hardlines for my brakes. After my 6th attempt to make the flares (2 good, 4 bad) I just gave up. In talking with another person they let me know they'd had the same issues and recommended a different product (not sold on Amazon). that one works perfectly every time. I think the issue is that this line is too soft allowing it to give into the torsional forces required to flare the line. The other line that works has a much more rigid feel to it (when bending it with a tube bender). Definitely do not use this with the Titan....I can't say how it would respond to a higher-end flare tool that only presses",0
"Title: One star is generous....
Review: 1.  Box arrived with case wrapped in a plastic bag, containing one can (empty), and a soggy cardboard tray with the other 23 cans. It appears to have blown up either prior to, or at UPS, as the box was a UPS box.<br /><br />2.  Positive- the level of carbonation was very good.<br /><br />3.  The flavors reminded me of rancid cough syrup. NONE of the 12 flavors were worth more than a sip, or the second can. There was a full-on flavor malfunction and also an aftertaste that did not want to go away.  The Dr. Zevia certainly was named well, for the resemblance to medicine.  The root beer smelled like root beer.  The fruit flavors weren't artificially colored, so essentially all looked like lemon-lime (which is actually fine by me).<br /><br />I",0
"Title: Doesn't Strengthen Nails
Review: This is just an expensive bottle of clear polish. It does not strengthen my nails. They still bend. A better choice for me is the Dollar Store  polish. It cost less and does the same thing.<br /><br />Nail Envy is a product that will strengthen the nails. It strengthens the actual nails.  It's not a quick fix.  It is applied in polish form. After a few weeks, the nails get stronger, harder, and the damaged is repaired The nails will grow long and strong, if used as directed. .  Nail Envy Strengthener is specifically for weak, red, peeling nails that have been damaged by wearing acrylic nails, gel polish, wear and tear,  etc....It is their Original Formula and it's about 20 bucks.

Review: I ordered and quickly received the iPhone 6 Plus / 6s Plus (5.5') Ballistic Screen Protector ShockWize ® [Tempered Glass] .3mm Thin Premium Real Glass Screen Protector iPhone 6 Plus / 6s Plus (5.5') [Lifetime Warranty].  The product packaging of this tempered glass screen protector was superb hard cardboard box with foam sidings inside a bubble envelope to minimize damage to the screen protector.

"Title: Good for both boys and girls
Review: This slime kit has premade slime and is similar to the one we have already. The difference is that it has tiny dinosaurs to play with, two plastic eggs filled with slime. The blue slime in the egg is the same as the one in containers only a little deeper color and is a bit thicker and the green one in the egg is very sticky and almost impossible to play with. The slime in containers is not sticky and does not leave a mess. There are various accessories to decorate slime in multitude of ways. I recommend this set. It's mostly no mess, I mean, glitter is always messy, but the slime itself is pleasant to play with.",1
"Title: Requires A Huge Bag For Attachment
Review: I bought this online directly from the manufacturer in China. For me, such a waste of money. Quality is good, sturdy enough for what it's designed to do. But, only if you carry a really huge bag to attach it to. It is adjustable, but, with the tightest adjustment it still requires a very large bag. Plus, it only anchors to the bag, not the luggage, so real stability is not adequate when sitting on top of luggage. If you still want to try it, buy through Amazon. At least you'll have instructions on how to use. Wish I had bought thru Amazon, much easier return.",0
"Title: Hard to find the movie in all this anecdote
Review: I really enjoy this book series. But this is the least interesting BFI book I've read. There is film writing that is enlivened with personal anecdote, and then there is film writing buried in it. Kennedy has produced a turgid, Proustian (not in the good way) essay that's so self-absorbed it defies an inlet for others. Kennedy introduces the film with a long, embroidered, meandering preamble about what was worn to school in the dark winters of her Scottish childhood. It is not illuminating, and frankly the tether to the movie was lost on me, except as an excuse to talk more about herself.<br /><br />One wants to grab her and say ""It's a short book. We don't have time for two pages of personal memoirs to set up each item you'd like to discuss",0
"Title: Fun & Easy to Learn
Review: Fun game show quiz style questions with buzzer when the answer is wrong, and a ding bell when the answer is right. No, it is not a game show, but I like the cute question style, particularly since studying for the Drivers License Exam can be as exciting as eating dry cardboard. I did find out from our local office Examiner that there is no time limit, unless you are not finished by closing time, which will cause an automatic Fail. So you should leave yourself as much time as you will need to answer 50 total questions, with 15 of those being Road Signs. You can retake the written exam in the U.S. at least 3 times, though I am not sure if every state will allow the 5 times which Wisconsin does. I like the color layout and format of this App. ",1
"Title: Works better for me than Protalus did
Review: Back story: I bought these after trying the Protalus m100’s and the 75’s. Really like the Protalus quality, and the company in general, and was happy enough to spend the $$$ on them. However, unfortunately the arch position on the Protalus was too close to me heel, and added a new pain to my plantar fasciitis issue. They were good and had me return them for a refund, so no complaints about the company.<br /><br />So I searched for an alternative... and these were well rated. I Thought for the $$, I could try them and just toss them if they didn’t work. They looked decent, so I got them.<br /><br />Well, clearly I like them pretty well, asi am giving 5 stars, with no reservations.<br /><br />I don’t know how they will hold up over time, but ",1

Review: Don't waste your time on these!<br /><br />Unless you find that more than 30 minutes in trying to apply 5 (five) &#34;3 inch&#34; in length pieces is educational.<br /><br />We cut the entire tape in pieces of about 3 inches in length. We cleaned the surface (glass) and applied one part of the fastener. Then, we tried to peel off the plastic foil on the fuzzy part of the fastener. Good luck with that! We had to convene an emergency meeting in the office to ask coworkers with longer finger nails to help. When some were successful, the plastic re-attached back to the surface, and if bent to get it easier to peel off just before finalizing the application, it would become firmly attached. A mess. We gave up.<br /><br />This product was an atte",0
"Title: Terrible instructions, but once you got it... KIDS LOVE IT
Review: Like all the other reviewers, I have to say - this thing was a pain to put together. The instructions were awful. Took about 3 hours, and that included some rework. Seriously, the instructions were AWFUL. Ended up adding the stickers on at the very end, and skipped some of them, because they would have required removal of the windshield to add them - at that point no one cared enough to do it. We were guessing where some of the stickers went based on the photo, and did toss out other ones because we were just so sick of dealing with assembly of this thing. Add another 15-20 minutes for doing stickers to the assembly time.<br /><br />That said, the kids absolutely love this thing. It's pretty spacious, with 3 kids being able to ride in it wi",1
"Title: Great value set.
Review: A great value set for lighter duty work. My Dewalt 18V drill melted 6 months ago when I was trying to do some more heavy duty work. These units a light weight which nice but concerns me a bit on the quality side of the motor. The batteries are much lighter but battery technology has come a long way since my last set. These wireless units are great for mobility but don't even compare to my plug in skill-saw and drill in regards to power. The saw is powerful enough to cut through a Christmas tree and a 2x4. Drill is just as powerful as my Dewalt was but about 20% lighter. Overall very pleased with the quality.",1
"Title: Sure like the flexible opening on the lid
Review: We needed a container to hold small items like bottle lids, porcelain tea bag holders, straws, lobster forks, nut picks and a plethora of other miscellaneous things that drop through the racks and require a search to find on the bottom of the dishwasher. It's odd that our new dishwasher didn't include something like this, but the Born Free basket is very nice and probably better than the rigid baskets in most dishwashers. It's flexible so it will squeeze into an area that might otherwise be a bit too small. And that flexible opening on the lid is fantastic. We pop things in there, don't have to open the lid, don't have to remove the basket, just a clever idea. The overall size is a bit big for our needs but ultimately it's not a problem. On",1
"Title: Great for stage and studio
Review: I received this as a free review sample. The tuner is the heart of this device, and the metronome is good enough for most musicians.<br /><br />What I love about the tuner is it has a very easy to read display and ability to run an electric instrument into the input, and out again to an amp. Or just in to tune. It also has a built in microphone for acoustic instruments. In addition it has modes for all chromatic instruments, guitar, bass, violin and ukelele. It allows transposition in the chromatic mode for instruments like saxophones. You can transpose to C, Bb, Eb and F. You can also transpose ukeleles to C or D using this feature.<br /><br />Another tuning feature that this has is the ability to set an A4 tone to any frequency between 41",1

Review: Bought this for my friends for Christmas, so don't know if they've used it or not.  They have gatherings of neighborhood friends, so thought they'd like it.  I looked at fire pits on many websites for about a month, then decided on this one.  It sounded sturdy, was up off the ground, would be easily moved by the rim and had smaller breathing spaces on the sides.  Some firepits were so lightweight.  I was warned about the weight by my son, who had worked at Lowe's.  The shipping was great.  Got to my friends quicker than I expected.",1
"Title: A ""Must Have"" for stapling thick documents..Buy It..
Review: Hi Folks,<br /><br />I purchase thousands of dollars worth of goods from Amazon every year. Some things I keep, some I return if the quality and design is not up to par. The Rapid HD220 Stapler is one &#34;Amazing Stapler.&#34; With hardly any force required, it staples hundreds of pages with no problems. I cannot tell you how pleased I am with this stapler. I own several staplers, electric and handheld. The electric staplers are good for not so thick documents while the manual staplers are more heavy duty and crush the electric staplers all day long. The Rapid HD220 Stapler is a hands down winner and a must have for any office. You never know when you will be stapling over 25 sheets or more and need a stapler like this. Buy One...If this r",1

"Title: One more naked emperor...
Review: This is a frustratingly dumb, contrived and tedious movie masquerading as an intellectual thriller.  Helen Mirren is a crime-solving former drug addict and blues singer who pretends to be an Eastern European countess and art connoisseur in order to avenge the death of her best friend's father.  It's not clear why she steals a weapon which is NOT the murder weapon and doesn't just tell the police what she knows.  Instead she goes on a ""Pretty Woman""-style shopping spree (complete with Nicole Farhi product placement), and runs around spouting a very suspect Russian accent and bidding on things at auctions. The whole film feels like a vanity project for Ms. Mirren.  Every male character encountering her must ogle her like mad and/or have sex w",0
"Title: Not better than a traditional ice cube tray
Review: We bought this in August for a camping trip in November. I guess I should have tested the product, but assumed since brand new there would be no problem. When we first tried to use it, it got hot and never made ice. We were camping with friends who had a different ice maker and they said unfortunately these devices are notoriously problematic and don’t last long. I contacted the customer service chat and because the return window closed, they told me to contact the manufacturer.  I will go back to using ice cube trays or buying bags of ice. Much easier!",0
"Title: Adorable Novelty Note Pads
Review: I selected these pads for my wife who is always looking for something to write on, and these are just about the perfect size for her. So far, we're both very pleased with them.<br /><br />This is a four-pack of ruled writing pads, decorated with cat silhouettes and a cute comment next to each. Some thought went into the design, bending the lines around the cat pictures.<br /><br />I like that these have adhesive on the back so they can be stuck on the refrigerator, mirror, window or other surface where they will most likely be seen. Basically, these are oversized sticky notes, and that works for us. We haven't had any trouble with them either leaving residue behind or falling from where they're stuck, and that's all we could really ask.<br ",1

Review: First, I have to tell you that I used Pampers only exclusively for my children and now my grandchildren. I love the way the fit and keep babies dry. Second, they are easy to put on and remove and they are just perfect for your babies in all sizes and shapes. What I really love about these Pampers is the new size pack. With 150 count, they are more economical and will last me for quite a long while.

"Title: In between sizes, got a large daypack for 27"" girth 50lb dog, he loves it
Review: My dog has a 27"" girth and I was not sure if he needed a medium or a large, I got a size large. The straps are designed so that they can be tightened all the way, so it was easy to tighten them down to his size. We got it recently but it seems very durable and well made, I'll update if we have any problems. The pockets are large enough to hold 2 standard disposable water bottles (16.9 oz or 500 ml) per side or a single 750 mL reusable water bottle. Weight wise this is probably the max that my dog can carry (it would be about 5lbs or 10% of his body weight). The pockets do seem big and roomy though!<br /><br />I decided not to use the attachment ring on the harness because it destabilizes the load when my dog moves about. I clipped the leash",1

Review: Update: July 11, 2014<br />I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.  But when I tried mixing Nutramax into her food, she wouldn't eat her food.

I love her because she is strong even though she is a bit insecure, like we all can be. Her family is a mix of ""crazy"" but wonderful lol.

"Title: Upgraded T-Shirt Dress
Review: This isn't your average t-shirt dress. It has high style paired with the ultimate in comfort. The fabric is soft and launders well. The fabric is a little heavier than a regular t-shirt. That makes it drape a bit better on the body. The hem hit me just above the knee. This dress looks as good with sneakers as with heels. Add a blazer or cardigan and you can wear it year-round. You can choose your normal size or size up for a relaxed fit. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. The medium would have been ideal for me.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1

Review: I literally just received this 5 minutes ago. I was excited to put my phone in it (I have a wallet case from another place that I love and wanted to switch up the colors) but I put my phone it in, 1 credit card and my license and it's too thick to really close all the way. By that I mean the front white magnetic part doesn't really touch the front of the case fully, just a part of it. Also, when I kind of just smushed it together to close the magnet fell out of the front (it is actually just taped into the white metal piece that is supposed to close the case). I don't know why the magnet would just be taped in instead of glued, but because of the force of the two magnets the tape just comes right off. Needs better construction.",0

And I looked up the ingredient to see what other purveyors had to say - and guess what? This is for digestive issues! Which I wasn't really aware I had, but these pills do seem to be helpful. And I would assume if you have digestive issues weighing you down, you are less likely to see auras.

There are a significant issues with this product. 1) the green balloons are so thin they pop nonstop. I had to rush out to purchase more. They did not pop in transit, they popped while no one was around. So it was either a ghost popping them or the fact that they are extremely low quality balloons. When I had them inflated, I was told that they would not fully fill them with air as the quality was poor. If they pop when the child is around, it could be extremely frightening.2) the star balloons do not look anything like they are pictured. Extremely disappointing.",0

As an adult, I had enormous difficulty making a potholder, it took a couple hours, the tooo tight loops kept popping off the too small posts on the loom. Weaving the last few loops on was an enormous challenge because of the tightness of the nearly finished potholder. My grand daughter simply couldn't do it. I skipped some posts on the 2nd one, and that worked better.<br /><br />Crocheting the potholder off was even worse, and had I not been so determined to complete the potholder, I would have given up an hour or so earlier.

Review: This is a really nice set of molds.  I was especially interested in the ashtray molds, and happy to see they are a nice size and good quality.  Furthermore, they release well.  One thing I notices is that the opposite side of the round ashtray can even be used to make a good size (6 cm) round disc that you can turn into a pendant or badge so that is an added plus.  The agate tray mold with this set is nice and shiny on the inside so should make for a wonderful cured surface.  Not sure I will be using that mold for anything.  With regard to the herb grinder molds, there are a lot of small diamonds to pour into so you'll really have to be double check that you don't have any bubbles in any of the little diamonds.

That said, I think these are really good (probably not all that good for you, but still tasty), and go great in iced teas.  They burst so easily releasing a little amount of watery, sweet apple goodness.  The container they come in says, ""After opening intended for immediate consumption"", but there's no way we can eat all these at one time so they're going into the fridge for later.

Review: These are very useful bins. They are very versatile and can be used for a wide variety of things. They are just as pictures. Do note that they have pretty big holes on the sides so something small could come out. You do need to use them to store things that are bigger so nothing falls out of those holes. I do wish they were a little smaller.<br /><br />It feels very well made. It stayed together nicely. It comes fully assembled. It has handles, which are convenient. I am letting my kids use them to help clean up their dolls.<br /><br />This one is a nice white, which is very versatile and would fit in many places. It would be good for the home or office. I would recommend them.",1
"Title: Beautiful dress
Review: This is a really beautiful dress. It is made with that delicate material that falls apart if washed too often, so I suggest hand washing and drying rather than machines (if you have ever had one of those awesome hippie dresses, you know what I mean- they unravel after two washings). The fit is beautiful and it is a very flattering dress. In fact, I am ordering it in another color. The one thing I wish I could change is the length. It is a little too short. And I am only 5'5&#34;. I wish it had at least another inch. I like my long dresses to really come down as far as possible without stepping on them. This brushes above my ankles. Still, love the dress!",1
"Title: The quality is very good and the comfort level surpasses my expectation
Review: bought this because needed a new pair of gaming headsets. I previous owned a pair of Astros before and I was already familiar with this brand. The quality is very good and the comfort level surpasses my expectation. But like any gaming headset it does get uncomfortable in long gaming sessions. The padding around the earmuffs are really comfortable and is like a memory foam and the same material on the top where it rests on your head. The wires are long enough to reach a good amount  of space and the sound quality is good. Best bet before buying is going to a bestbuy and trying them out for yourself. Their are other headsets that are good for lesser.",1
"Title: Used this snorkelling mask for teaching swim lessons!!
Review: I actually hadn't used this snorkel mask at all since I purchased it a couple months ago for an eventual snorkelling trip at some point, but well, I used it the other day (in a modified fashion with the snorkel removed), as a Full face water proof mask to great effect, for a swim lesson ! Honestly, the more I thought about it, YMCA and other community Pool swim lessons could definitely consider using such a type full-face snorkel mask as a means to legitimately market their functioning swim lesson programs and teach them accordingly within an acceptable margin of safety!  imho ...",1

What prompted this purchase was the round cross that makes it easy to slip in an out of my pocket without getting caught on fabric or pocket contents.

"Title: This did not work for overly excited 30lbs mix
Review: We adopted a 2 year old mix just over a year ago. Shes the best dog but the worst on a leash. When we first adopted her she had never been on a leash before, therefore had zero manners.  Now, a year later, she has one speed, RUN. Whether it's to from from our walk she pulls thr worst I've ever seen and has only gotten worse. We tried this walker (and about 4 others) and this has been the least effective. Within a minute of having it on and ripped it off, I put it on again and attempted to walk, nope, thankfully I brought an addition leash attached to her collar just incase she got off and I'm so glad I did or she qouldve been a goner.",0

Review: This blanket looks just like the photo in ad. The off white is creamy and the subtle brown looks pretty against it. The black print is only on 1 side. The fringe is about 4 inches long. All the weaving is even and the knots are tight. When I unpacked this, I was nervous about any off-smell. This company is hit or miss with “shipping smells”. There was none though! It could be used right out of the packaging. I love that it’s 100% cotton. It traps all the warm air in and keeps you cozy. The neutral brown can go  with gobs of interior color schemes. Farmhouse, Tuscan, Classical French, Transitional. Very versatile!",1
"Title: NOT for newborns/infants
Review: Inflatable cushions only held air the first two times we used the tub. We have a double under-mount sink in our kitchen so we cannot place it in our sink but rather have to have it on the counter and it just barely fits (if you have it so the baby is facing you). It's slippery and so it's really difficult to support a newborn with one hand while you try to maneuver bath products and a wash cloth with the other. We'll keep it and use it for our son in the bathtub when he's able to sit by himself but even then I'm concerned about the slippery nature of the plastic...<br /><br />Now I have to buy another baby bathtub and I'm thinking about the kind with the mesh hammock feature.",0

Review: I was stunned to find this actually fit the lock space on my Lenova X1 Carbon, I bought this refurb about 2 years ago and wasn't even sure what that spot was for. It seems really solid. I'm pondering if the adhesive might still be a better option as it feels like you could snap this out of the cheap plastic computers are made of fairly easily. My computer sits at easy access to a door and a grab and run is possible. It's not the machine anyone cares about it's what ON the machine that is troubling. But I'm very happy with this purchase!",1
"Title: Awful, just awful.
Review: Even though the container itself has no flaws and manages to hold gas, I have to give this one star. I really do hate it.  They've managed to make this relatively simple process overly complicated and dangerous.<br /><br />After getting it in the mail, I drove up to the local gas station and filled it up. I of course stored the spout the way you normally would, inside the container, with the provided dust cap in-place. I drove back home to gas up my mower.<br /><br />I pulled out the spout, flipped it around, put the dust cap aside and was ready to pour. &#34;Hmmm... how in the heck do I do this?&#34; The safety spout was a nightmare. You have to twist it and then push down on the top of the spout. The way they instruct you to do this is wi",0
"Title: So much fun!
Review: Like a lot of people, we've spent most of 2020 at home, social distancing. One of my favorite new hobbies this year is cross stitching. I've only done a couple so far, but I really like this set the best so far! The colors are pretty and the quality of the materials is good. It will take quite a while for me to finish three, so I consider it an excellent value!!!<br />This set comes with (almost) everything you need to get started. But if you're new to cross-stitching, I would strongly recommend picking up a needle threader. You can get them on here or I saw them for only a dollar in my local box store's sewing section. A threader will save you so much time and stress, plus will ensure this project remains fun!",1
"Title: An Episode of Horrible Bosses Christmas Edition
Review: Charles Dickens couldn't have written a better version of Scrooge. I love Christmas carols and MM Christmas stories. I also enjoy re-watching the traditional favorites annually on TV as I write up my reviews. My darker side is showing as I also watch Homicide for the Holidays, Snapped, Forensic Files, and Deadly Women marathons. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Criminal Science so my interest in murder is longstanding. I've been reading a lot of True Crime lately, but this book's cover caught my eye immediately.

"Title: 2:00 a.m. writing this because I'm angry- Just finished the books
Review: This was a tedious read that came to an unsatisfactory (rather non)conclusion. Someone has compared the author to JRR Tolkien, I would never put these books in the hands of young readers. The books are salacious, vivid in sexuality, with liberal usage of the &#34;F&#34; word. If you like books flavored thusly then go ahead and read, I found it annoying. I plowed through these books in the hopes of finding out who would win the game of thrones **SPOILER ALERT** there is no winner, the author does not see fit to give his loyal readers any conclusion and leaves all the characters hanging in the wind. It is almost as if he just got tired of writing his story so he just labeled the last chapter he wrote as &#34;Epilogue&#34;. I am sorry I wasted",0
"Title: This book shows that some socipaths do feel pain-albeit only that of their own emptiness
Review: Jackie Overton (AKA Samuel Jacob Cooper, and a very long list of other known aliases) is a classic example of an ethically bankrupt predator: a soulless sociopath who self-medicates her lack of an inner self by serial and overlapping exploitation of vulnerable others.<br />Her cons are played out through obsessive manipulation of the emotions of those who have what she craves most: a life.<br />Her book transparently reveals her heavy embellishment of the details of her deception of Sister Wife Meri Brown. Much of the book is clearly composed of outright lies. The lies are repetitive, tedious and often internally inconsistent. The author doesn't care. Not about the pain she causes, not about anyone, except herself, and filling the hollow em",0

Review: Years ago I subscribed but, it got too expensive. All magazines have sponsors, ad rates are set by number of subscribers. It does not cost a fortune to send out a magazine by mail ~EVEN less via the internet yet the price between paper copy and electronic cope remains close to the same. Screw that! No paper, no printing costs, not postal costs and yet they want to same or nearly that same money as a print copy!  No, I won' do it. Magazine publishers are so greedy!<br />I would pay $7.00 to $10.00 a year for  12 magazines; half that for 6 issues per 12 month; for ever.

Review: A couple of years ago I bought two &#34;Currently Vaults&#34; directly from Bits and Pieces. Even after all this time the mechanism still works flawlessly. It's a great way to give cash presents. When I saw that I can buy these from Amazon and get free shipping, I ordered another &#34;Currency Vault&#34;. Upon opening the package I immediately saw that the box contained what appeared to be unfinished pieces where the locking mechanism is.

"Title: I immediately slept more soundly with no downside.
Review: This worked immediately for me. I sleep more soundly than I have in years and I see no downside to it, but I would caution that it is not a solution to all of your problems, only a piece of the puzzle to improve your health.<br /><br />Personally, I lay the pad between the bedsheets under my bare legs, so there is direct skin contact. My wife just places it in the bed and sleeps on it with pajamas. She says it helps her sleep, but nothing phemnomenal. I think the more direct skin contact you have the more likely you will see results.",1
"Title: VERY DANGEROUS TO PEOPLE AS WELL AS RATS
Review: I have used Victor spring mouse traps without any problem but the rat traps were another matter. The springs are so strong it is difficult to keep the wire snap trap open while it is being set. Victor tells users to hold each side with a thumb while setting the trap. But if a user is using both thumbs to hold each side, the user doesn't have a third hand to hook the trap holder to the catch. And if the user tries to hold the trap open with one thumb, it takes only a couple of seconds until the powerful spring forces the user to release the trap. In my case I was attempting to manipulate the hook into the catch when the trap gave way and the force of the trap closing drove the hook wire right into my thumb even though I was holding the hook ",0

Review: This is Scott-Heron at his best, even on his first release. Add this to 'Pieces of a Man', 'Free Will', and 'Winter In America' and you have enough brilliant, groundbreaking work for several acts. The consistency of the tracks here, and his delivery of biting, no-punches-pulled commentary are dead on. Nothing was quite like Gil Scott-Heron before. and his work is still vibrantly relevant and needed today. As for Michael Ruby's remark about Scott-Heron becoming 'the very name-calling oppressor he speaks out against', Ruby is a fool He completely misses what the man was doing. Yet another liberal with socially-constrained guilt manipulating his thought. Get his. you will NOT be sorry.",1

Review: Offensive and unrealistic characters. I never believed I would give a one-star review largely because an ending. I have generally thought that good writing is good even if the ending is lousy and that is true. The writing here isn't terrible and thought the pace is slow you can roll with it if you aren't in a hurry and don't have a lot of better things to read. But there are some very offensive characterizations, primarily a very negative characterization of a person with a disability. It was pretty obvious from the beginning that this character would turn out to be positive, so I held out hope. But then the author simply cured the disability and thus the character became positive. Hence a disabled character is still deemed unlikeable and u",0

Review: Every time I’ve used the microphone it has lost connection in the middle of a song.  I mean EVERY SINGLE TIME, and I was stationary and less than 8’ from the speaker.  Sound quality is POOR, there is a distinct high-pitched ringing coming from the speaker at all times and it will drive you crazy.  If you attempt to utilize the speaker to its full 200-watt capacity you will hear crackling that will compel you to turn it down.

From my experience of human hair - this wig seems more like synthetic hair. The price is not worth it for this quality of hair.

Review: Although it's a bit of an improvement over previous versions, Norton still holds the title as the biggest resource hog for PCs.  I bought this to give them a chance after many years of avoidance.  I only kept it installed for about 1 week as it continued to cause one system issue after another.  If you are running Vista or Windows 7, the firewall built into the OS is excellent.  All you need is a free anti-virus product such as AVG Free and you are set to go without all of the memory and CPU overhead demands on your PC and you are still very well protected.

The magnetic closure works great as long as you dont have anything metal close by, since when you got through or if the wind blows really heavy, it may attach to that metal instead of closing back.

Review: These amber glass bottles, and included components, are of excellent quality.  I have ordered glass bottles in the past and while the bottles themselves were always okay, the sprayer was often inferior (plus they usually don’t have the other components such as labels, funnel, marking pen, caps).  The glass bottles are great, gorgeous color and sturdy glass.  Colored bottles are needed for certain liquids (peroxide, for example, always comes in an amber/brown container to protect it from light).  The sprayer is high quality and is sturdy.  The spray action is also great - you can set it on mist or stream.  As I noted, the sprayer has been my downfall on previous bottle purchases, so I am happy to see that the sprayers on these are top notch.",1

"Title: I saw there was a pretty big kink in the tubing
Review: We bought this for halloween this year. I cant wait to use it Halloween night. When I first turned it on, it made the really loud sound as others have described. I went back looking through the reviews and about the guy who had a split tube and saw that after fixing his tube, he didn't have an issue. I looked at my tubing, it is extremely cheap tubing. I saw there was a pretty big kink in the tubing. I fixed it and it worked perfectly. I had tons of smoke. And the loud sound was completely gone. I live in Florida where there is high humidity, I don't know if that made a difference in making a ton of fog versus other people's experience but it did a great job. I've been playing with it every day trying to figure out positioning for the grave",1
"Title: The pillow is the issue
Review: Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I am quite satisfied with the heater. Just enough to warm my arthritic senior cats, and not too hot where I would be concerned it would hurt them. Feel the bed after your cat has laid in it. However, there is one main unsatisfactory issue with this bed. Within a very short time of one of my cats laying in it, the pillow collapsed in the center. It now looks like a donut. There is no cushioning underneath that, so it's just like they would be laying on the floor. Not good for arthritis or older cats. So I started looking online for an orthopedic pillow that would fit, but this just adds to the cost of an already pricey bed. I ended up purchasing the separate heater (which is sold on Amazon) and putting it in ",0
"Title: Don't waste your $$$$$ !!!!!!!
Review: Purchased this ""Hat"", when it arrived, 1) It is 'NOT', I repeat...<br />IT IS NOT MADE OF LEATHER!!!!!<br />as the info says. It is made of some.... ""Plastic-Leather"" or ""Pleather"" material. 2) Holy god........ THE SMELL !!! Bad nasty burnt 'plasticy' odor. 3) The stitching, was coming apart as I pulled it out of the box. And 4)... After trying to contact the sellers of 'said hat' (more than three times)that I had been hit by the great North-East Flood this past month and I needed them to 'send me' an RA (Return Authorization)Number because our printer was demoed in the flood, They never once returned my emails. Even sent an email to Amazon.com and once again... off into 'the void' my email goes, unanswered.........<br />  Advice to you....",0
"Title: Best XBox One Accessory
Review: This is my favorite XB1 accessory by far.  I use the XB1 more for BluRay discs and Netflix than anything else.  This makes it far easier for the family to use the XB1 while watching movies.  The mute button is great and quick to use.  The remote lights up when you move it which is great for a dark theater room.  I have an IR sensor remotely mounted on my receiver, this remote makes it very easy and quick to change the volume.  Movie controls are laid out well and its a good size.  Will see how long the two AAA batteries last.",1

"Title: Perfect for Potty Training!
Review: Of all the brands of diapers I've tried out over my years as a mom, I always come back to Pampers as my favorite for quality. They're not the cheapest diaper out there, but I know I can count on them to be soft, gentle on my baby's skin and super absorbent. These diapers are no exception! I love the stretchy waistband. They're perfect for potty training because you can pull them up and down, but they're super absorbent like a diaper. There's a tape strip on the back of each diaper so you can still neatly roll them up for disposal, just like a regular diaper. I have no complaints so far and would order these again!",1
"Title: The Spring of Rite
Review: When this album came out in 1991 it immediately stood out because it sounded like nothing else before -- or since.  Greenland made use of the current digital synthesizers (he was a sound designer for Ensoniq) but in a way that was totally unique to John.  His pieces on this album are more ""tone poems"" than pretty little tunes; in fact they share more with Stravinsky or Holst than the New Age ""knife and fork music"" which was popular at the time.  These are bold singular tracks, challenging and rewarding of repeated listenings.<br /><br />Over the years most of the digital synthesis of the '90s has faded from my playlist.  Not so with ""Soft Robot"" -- it remains one of the handful of really unique statements which still manages to amaze and de",1
"Title: So sorry I made this purchase!
Review: I hate it! First, the description says 27.5 but it is actually a 26. What  a lie and a huge disappointment. It is a rough ride, the gears don't work correctly, and virtually NO suspension. The 1st speed is super fast which is kind of amazing but it's too fast to get any kind of workout and I have to push on and off to not pass cars. I haven't even tried the 5th speed as it is fast. It does go up hills well and battery last a long time. This was my chance to get an E bike but now I'm stuck with this heap of uselessness.",0
"Title: Don't let anyone tell you you don't need soap.
Review: I got this cleaner to clean my diamond engagement ring, which had one of the small diamonds replaced a few months ago.  At the time the stone was replaced, the ring was cleaned at the jeweler's and I was astonished at how much more it sparkled than it had when I brought it in.  Anyway, fast forward 4 months, and the ring is looking less impressive, but to top it off, the new stone is looking nearly an opaque white.  I abuse this ring by wearing it almost constantly regardless of what I'm doing, so I wanted to give the whole thing a good cleaning before accusing them of replacing the missing diamond with something other than a diamond.<br /><br />After seeing the good reviews here and elsewhere, I selected this unit.  I've seen lots of place",1
"Title: Painful and upsetting
Review: I work in an office setting on my feet most of the day. At first, the shoes are comfortable and springy. However, after prolonged use my feet hurt so bad that I take them off as soon as I enter my car after my shift. The heel area rubbed the skin off my heel so bad I had to wear bandaids for a few days. Because it’s a wedge I knew there would be added pressure on the balls of my feet, but I was willing to deal with mild discomfort since I wanted something a little cuter to wear with my dresses. The pain is so bad on the balls of my feet, arches, and heels I could cry. I hate these shoes and will never buy again. The soles are not supportive nor comfortable.",0
"Title: Gorgeous!  Personalized
Review: This is a gorgeous Earpod Pro Case.  It's clear so you can see the charge light.  The opening in the bottom makes charging a breeze.  I imagine you can still wireless charge but I did not try it yet.  The shipping was so fast.  I expected it to take a few weeks.  Anything I order personalized seems to take a month--but no it took about a week.  Also included is a handy cord to attach your earpods to for exercise or just because you are scared to loose them--I am terrified to loose them.  There is also a clip that attaches so you can clip it to your bag or backpack.  I certainly reccomend them and I would have loved to get them as a gift so I'd say they make a nice gift.",1
"Title: Blah
Review: This book had amazing reviews and was compared to the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon which is my favorite series so I was very excited. I am over half way through and can't finish. I have had to force myself to read this far, only reading a few boring and dull pages a night. Nothing has caught my attention or peaked my interest. The writer goes into these terribly boring and drawn out descriptions of history like a history book that last for 10 pages. Her writing is nowhere near as amazing and beautifully descriptive as Diana's. I have no clue how this series has been compared to Outlander. Maybe it gets better? I won't know. I absolutely hate forcing myself to read and won't continue to do so. Reading should be fun and so far this book",0
"Title: Why are they repackaging ominbus editions...
Review: ...when Stross never finished the series.  I agree with the reviews here reflecting that these books make for a great read and keep us all fascinated and wanting more.  But after reading the shocking ""to be continued"" end of book 6, it appears that the author never intends to finish this story line.  Reviews for that book are mostly dissatisfied (see the reviews at [[ASIN:0765355914 The Trade of Queens: Book Six of the Merchant Princes]] ).<br /><br />If you don't care that they never come to any kind of a real conclusion, then by all means, enjoy the journey.

"Title: TurboTax Wouldn't Accept Code- Intuit Double charge for tax filing
Review: Obviously Intuit doesn't like people getting a discount on their product. I never could get it to work right. I had to call customer support, who was very nice but she couldn't get the code to work and asked if I wasn't sure I purchased a version for Mac instead of Windows.  Its an electronic file. Only amazon knows what they sent me.<br />I never could get it work and was blackmailed into paying 110.00 to Intuit to finish filing my taxes. I'm fighting with them over this. This code never worked.<br />I don't recommend Intuit if you don't have to use them and definitely don't recommend purchasing from amazon.",0
"Title: Essentially useless.
Review: I had a sponge like this a while back.  I couldn't remember the brand, but I remember it was great for a quick shine.  Didn't last too long, but worked so quickly and easily, I still loved it.  Decided to pick this one up, thinking it would be like that one I had in the past.  Yeah, not quite.<br /><br />I got the sponge, and took out a pair of shoes to shine.  On the first shoe, it looked like the sponge was soaked, and the shoe took a really high gloss -- but by the time I got to the other side of the shoe, the gloss was noticably less.  When I moved to the second shoe in the set, the sponge was doing nothing more than brushing off the light dust on the shoe.  No gloss at all, no shine, nothing at all.  Rubbing a dry rag on the shoe would",0

Each cell is at it's absolute widest (wing span), just over a centimeter wide.

Review: I haven't figured out the timer on this toothbrush or noticed that there is any indicator of timer.  This brush made my gums so sensitive I couldn't use it a third day, and haven't used it in the past six days while my gums are healing.  I held it lightly to my teeth and brushed.  The brushes I ordered to go with it have no English on the package even though they are labeled Oral B.  There was no instruction for putting the brush on the handle and I discovered after use that the washer that was supposed to go on before the brush head wasn't on and it must have gotten lost with the packing material when I opened the package.",0

"Title: My dog loves these!
Review: My dog comes a running when he hears the bag crinkle! I only give them to him as an occasional treat since their cost is so dear. Also they are produced with the skins on them, which from what I researched isn't harmful to dogs, however, for some dogs they say the skins may upset their tummies. My dog has a cast iron stomach so he fairs well with the few I give him. Lol.<br /><br />You can certainly save some money and dehydrate your own even if you don't have a dehydrator. Ive made them using my oven as a dehydrator, and while making them yourself would be done at cheaper cost, it takes more time than I care to spend, and uncooked, fresh yams are hard to cut (by hand at least, and you can easily cut your hand (like I did) if you're not car",1
"Title: Great value for the price!
Review: For the price this is such a great machine!  I put it together by myself (with the help of my 2 year old) in about an hour.  It clunked a little at first but quickly went away.  I'm 5' 10&#34; so the stride is a little short for me but when I got used to it, it hasn't bothered me at all.  The 8 levels of resistance are kind of a joke.  There really isn't a noticeable difference between them (but I did put it together by myself so it could be my error).<br />I used it 4-5 times a week for a half and hour every time and it's held up very well.  I have a small area in my bedroom for it so I needed something on the smaller side and this fits perfectly!  Couldn't have asked for more.",1

Review: I was drawn to this by the title, as my father died a month ago today and I have been pretty screwed up over it. I have been a fan of Loudon, Rufus and Martha Wainwright for decades now, and this was an easy choice.<br /><br />Once again, lush music and voices and wonderful folkiness. The title track is ridiculously touching, but this album is a wicked mix of melancholy and whim. &#34;I Remember Sex&#34; is a hilarious little dirty while &#34;The End is Now&#34; is crazy sad. The whole album is like that and it is perfect.",1

"Title: Pretty art, but not a real, functioning phone case!
Review: [[VIDEOID:c3940f5daf63bcd260a471b447749ceb]] Read the description carefully. This is a gel case, not a hard plastic one. This phone case only looks pretty, but is completely impractical if you want actual protection for your phone. It's nothing but a paper-thin soft plastic cover, nothing else. Even for a gel case, it's very flimsy. I should have read the ""fine print"" carefully, because I was expecting hard, substantial plastic. This will do absolutely nothing to protect my phone if it's dropped. If you want a case that's for more than just for looks, look elsewhere.",0

Review: We have a black cat. When we first adopted her, we called her a vampire cat because of her fangs. We saw this and had to have it. Yes, it's called a dragon cat, but it could just as easily be a vampire cat! That works for us! It inflates easily. The blower is not too noisy. The noise is comparable to other inflatables. The front feet are weighted with sand (or other material) whereas the back ones are not. It comes with rope and stakes to secure it in place. There are LED lights inside for fun effects. We have tried this out in the living room but can't wait until we set it up in the yard.",1

Review: I have been playing a variety of Hohner harmonicas for over 30 years. so I know the usual quality and value of their products. I ordered one of these before Christmas because I wanted to venture into the world of the slide chromatics. (I had been playing slideless ones and other models for years.) It was offered at a great price, so I placed my order because I knew the price would soon rise.<br /><br />The original arrived in a timely manner, but was defective. I won't go into detail on this, but it was of no use to me as a performer. The replacement arrived today. Surprise! It was in no better shape than the original! It had some of the same problems, but also a couple of new ones. I am returning this one, too. I hope that the third time w",0
"Title: NOT TITANIUM
Review: These earrings are definitely not titanium.  I am allergic to every metal except titanium and gold. I put these earrings in and went to bed. The next morning my ears were itchy, I assumed it was due to just changing them so I put some ointment and went on to Thanksgiving with family. By that night I had to take them out. My left ear was bleeding and had fluid discharge, and my right ear was swollen to the point the earring was stuck. I felt like I was ripping my ear open pulling it out.<br />Secondly these earrings are incredibly hard to screw together and very easy to misthread. If you misthread them it's nearly impossible to get them unscrewed. I had to use plyers to unscrew it to clean them before I put them in.<br /><br />Don't buy. Don",0

I used the elimination method to trace the culprit. It was the wipe warmer!

"Title: Super bright
Review: I bought this for my husband to use at our rental property.  He has to do work on it from time to time and he really needs a good light source.  This is exactly what he needed.  The panels are adjustable so he can tilt them and move the light to point wherever he needs it.  It's super bright so it's plenty of light even if it's the only light available in the room.  It does need to be plugged in to work,  but you can use a portable power station if you need it.  It has a built-in tripod so it stands on its own and you don't have to worry about clamping it to a beam or something.  The best part is that it folds up into a compact unit that can be easily stored.  It's perfect for someone like him who will only use it on occasion.  Even if you ",1

Review: There is a reason why this receives so many negative reviews. This is the slowest paced book I've ever read. I read 4 books a week, but this one read so slow that I double checked that I was really on page 38, after what seemed I'd been reading for days. This authors thanks so many people, but where were the good editors? I completely concur with those readers who were teed off with the ending. It is a non ending. You're reading along and suddenly the ending arrives. Bad ending and a poorly executed story. I have a couple of piles of books: books I take to the thrift store, and books that are so bad I toss them out. It doesn't happen often, as I read so much and can forgive a whole lot if the story is good. But this one is an abject tosser.",0

Review: It's unfortunate that this cute little toy which does an excellent job of copying the 1950s original is so poorly constructed. It looks nice from the outside but after about 5 uses of just a few minutes each time the toy started to falter. After a few more uses it stopped walking altogether and now only lights up when you push the buttons. This is my second purchase of one of these Piston Action Robots and both failed quickly. If you want it just to look at or display it's fine but they will not function long if that is important to you.",0

"Title: Yes and No. Valve failed immediatly! Total Garbage.
Review: I was really hoping this would be a decent device to use on my Dogs. The on/off valve failed immediately shooting water from it. This would have been better if not even there!  Had to remove the shower head to get the closest fitting on. Their is a standard garden hose one included, but the other fittings I doubt will fit anything in the states.. The apparent compression fitting with the bead chain is still a mystery to me??<br />One of the main design flaws if you ask me is the fIngers  should have been made so your can just switch hands if needed.

"Title: Strong Requires 2 person installation
Review: I have tempted to install this by myself but it was really cumbersome so it was hard to do it by myself mostly because I have a stove top on the counter so I can't move the stovetop. Once my son came to help me it was fairly fast it took probably 15 minutes.  It is hardwired doesn't have a plug. The wires are the correct colors black white green it was able to wire a plug to it which makes it easier and then we'll have to mess with the outlet. The fan is very strong it's got three speeds the strongest one is really nice.  The lights are also very bright so I also very happy with those.

Review: I've had this phone ring stand holder attached to the back of my phone for several days now.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not, but I like it.  I haven't tried to un-stick it as it seems to be very stuck to the back of my phone (case off).  The ring on it is stiff to bend up or down, but that's a good thing because it hold the phone up like a stand does.  The ring also makes holding my phone easier as I can hold it by one finger while my arms are loaded with other stuff.  The spinner is a perk that I don't use but it might be good for nervous types.  All in all - very good and useful so far.",1

Review: This is my second book in Stacey Shannon's Kowalskis series. This title could easily be a stand alone title. There are lots of other characters in it that have been introduced in previous titles. I was confused a little bit in the other one that I read, but the main characters in this are not Kowalskis, so I found it not a problem in this one. I really liked this book a lot. It's definitely a formula romance, but there are a lot of fresh and new elements to it that I didn't feel like it's something I've already read. I also appreciated that there wasn't a huge dramatic misunderstanding or event that separated the two love interests. I found that to be more true to life. There is a lot of ATV activity which doesn't really interest me, but I ",1

The sensor bridge, contact and motion sensors are problematic to say the least. I have 2 contact sensors and 3 motion sensors connected to the sensor bridge. Right now all of them are offline, they started going offline one by one. Distance from the sensors to the bridge is not an issue since two of them are located no more than three feet away from the bridge. This is not the first time this has happened. The only solution for me has been to reset bridge and sensors, and reinstall them one by one. Many people complain about the same issue, and this keeps happening.

Review: I've wanted a Kaweco because so many people rave about how smoothly they write, but my overall impression of their pens is that they aren't very attractive. While I view all my fountain pens as tools, ultimately I still like to enjoy looking at them. Enter the Kaweco Student Fountain Pen.<br /><br />I got the one that's cream-and-orange--called '70s Soul'. It's a much more classic shape, with a gold-colored nib, section, cap band, clip, and Kaweco logo jewel on top of the cap. The body is a lovely cream, with the slightest taper toward the end. The cap is orange, but not a bright orange. Definitely a 70s darker orange (but NOT burnt orange). I'm not a huge fan of metal sections, but this one isn't slippery despite being very shiny.

Trouble in terms of dropping out going calls, many times it won't send my text messages and there are times I have learned of missed calls coming in which isn't good when you use this as your only phone.  I realize I saved some money on getting the refurbished model to replace my original but am now thinking I have to spend the money to get something that would be really reliable on a consistent basis.  I don't blame the folks who refurbished it because it probably worked for them when testing it out.",0
"Title: all this sodium, fat, sugar and chemicals are NOT 'money-saving'
Review: Warning!  IF YOU LIKE SANDRA LEE, please do not read further ... this review will tick you off royal!<br /><br />This book is just stupid ... and let me count the ways ...<br /><br />First - As I was flipping through this book, I came to realize all the semi-hidden  ;-)  adverti$ements ... Swanson, Progresso, Carnation, McCormick, etc. etc. etc. Then I started to think about all the sodium, fat, chemicals and extra sugars in these ingredients. Made my heart skip a beat ... more or less ...<br /><br />Second - These recipes are NOT inexpensive to make. And with all the brand names called out ... they should pay US to read these hidden adverti$ements - every recipe is full of name-brand items - some are COMPLETELY name-brand items ... Nouvell",0
"Title: Brownie Lovers - this one is for YOU!
Review: The keyword in the title is ""Decadent""!  There are some stunning brownie recipes here!<br /><br />I was offered a copy of this small cookbook to examine and review, and, being the unrepentant chocoholic that I am, I jumped at the chance.  And, being an unrepentant chocoholic, I usually have the ingredients on hand to whip up a quick batch of brownies.<br /><br />My first foray with this book was the recipe for Dark Chocolate and Raspberry Liqueur Brownies -- quick, easy, no brainer!  These are scrumptious dark chocolate brownies with dark chocolate chips plus the addition of raspberry liqueur --- what's not to love??  Rich, yummy!<br /><br />Next were the Cherry Cabernet Brownies -- I love dried cherries anyway (I put them in bran muffins -",1
"Title: Poor quality, rips before getting them on
Review: I have worked in the medical field for over 20 years and I have never seen such shoddy equipment.  There must be no quality control at the manufacturer and don't be misled by the name ""MedPride' or ""NitriPride"".  We use these gloves for daily treatments and nearly 50% tear before we get them on.  This is multiple people that are having this problem.  Our visiting nurse won't even try anymore, he brings his own gloves. We ordered large and X-large and they both are crap.  Unless you have a lot of disposable income, look elsewhere because there is zero value for your money in these gloves.",0
"Title: AWESOME Music TERRIBLE content protection
Review: My wife bought this music album (it's not technically a CD, as they do not conform to Philips' standards) so she could play it on her MP3 player, which is not an iPod and can play WMA files.  She did not realize it's content protected until it was too late - you can't return it once it's open, even if the incredibly mindless and highly restrictive content protection software is defective or poorly designed.  In this case, the content protection software is just that - very poorly designed and doesn't allow for help if it has errors.  I cannot do anything I am legally entitled to do except play the disc in one of my computers.  I cannot get the WMA export to work nor the backup disc burning due to a license installation error with a fancy he",0
"Title: Absolutely Adorable!!!
Review: This dress is absolutely adorable!!! Seller had it well packaged and it came before the expected receiving date!!<br /><br />Pros: IT IS ADORABLE!!! My daughter looks so cute wearing this dress!! The shirt part of the dress is good quality, not flimsy or cheap. It has a beautiful bow on the front that sits perfectly center.<br /><br />Cons: Only critique, is that the slip underneath is not sewn straight with the rest of the dress. It is defiantly noticeable. (But not bad enough to reduce a star.)<br /><br />Overall this is such a cut adorable dress. Definitely worth the cost. I can’t wait to hear the compliments that my daughter will get when we have her wear it to an outing.",1
"Title: I don't recommend purchasing this.
Review: I bought this to use occasionally when we take our son to restaurants with us. I don't like those gross uncomfortable wooden ones the restaurants provide and this was cheap enough that if something happend to it the world wouldn't end. It's a decent portable high chair except for two huge design flaws that make it pretty much useless to me. Both issues are with the tray. The first problem is that the tray does not slide off or on easily and it's really a two man job to put a child in the seat. One person to hold the baby in the chair with their arms up and another person to slide in the tray. The second problem, and the main reason I won't use it again, is that the trays underside is very thin plastic. My son was sitting in it in a shirt an",0
"Title: Short yet in-depth and expert resource on Wilson's disease even though this was written in 2001
Review: I’ve recently suspected a very close friend of mine as having Parkinson's disease (PD) with both movement and cognitive issues. Since he refuses to seek medical counsel, I decided to learn all I could via Internet searches and by purchasing seven (7) books on PD. It was during my reading that I discovered there are many other diseases (including brain tumors) that exhibit Parkinsonian systems yet are not PD. The fact that my friend had one parent who died of a brain disease and another parent and brother of liver failure made me want to explore the possibility of Wilson’s disease because it’s a recessive (requires genes from both parents) genetic (inherited) disease of copper accumulation and toxicity that affects both the liver and brain.<",1
"Title: For My Taste, Great CD!
Review: I am a novice pedal steel player, so I tend to listen for good pedal steel licks when I listen to music. One rainy Saturday afternoon my wife and I were watching a movie (can't remember what it was) and I picked up on some pretty good pedal steel in the sound track. So, I checked the movie credits for the players and it was Billy Tulsa and the Psycho Crawdads (the name intrigued me as much as the music). I went on the Internet and was lucky enough to find a used original CD. The only discrepancy I can find, oddly enough, is the steel player listed on the CD cover is Marty Ripkin, but in the Internet bios it's Tom Brumley ([...] Anyway, Tennessee Rain is one of my favorite CD's.",1
"Title: Does not fit a factory installed 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee 2"" Hitch
Review: I got a dud. With the hex bolt all the way out, the expandable stock does not retract at all which means it does not fit into my 2"" receiver at all. You think a small company would have better quality checks especially when a quick visual inspection can see the obvious issue.<br /><br />But I've seen other reviews on here about people receiving used/returned items.... so why was my hitch already adjusted out (expanded)? If it is not used/returned/broken shouldn't I have received one that is completely level and squared up?<br /><br />I like that they immediately took the return and refunded my money. But maybe that's a sign of guilt or not wanting to generate any attention? Someone at the company is reading this right now... you got caught.",0
"Title: Healing and Comforting
Review: GAIAM and the Mayo Clinic teamed up to make this healing and comforting DVD. It explains what integrative medicine is and addresses lifestyle issues that may be causing the viewer to experience insomnia. Really I'd get this just for the ten minutes of relaxing meditation practice led in a non religious way by Rodney Yee. Then there is an excellent 27 plus minutes of yoga practice that is appropriate for most body types. To do the yoga you do however need some props. I used a folded blanket, chair, strap, yoga mat and towel. I wished I still had my yoga blocks. They would have been very useful for one pose in particular.<br /><br />There is much to view on this DVD including a fun shopping trip to a grocery store you will wish was close to y",1
"Title: Heavy duty
Review: This canopy is way more heavy duty than we imagined, but in a good way. Previously, we have had pop ups that could not stand even in the lightest winds. This is the first that feels very sturdy and not easily bendable. The set up is pretty simple plus we watched a few video clips other owners put up. Yes, one person can assemble, two just makes it even simpler. The canopy itself feels strong and sturdy and truly does not feel as though it would rip easily. Bottom line, this is heavy but worth every dollar. The bag also has wheels you can attach making this easier to transport.",1
"Title: Learning the ABC's is fun and exciting!
Review: I love apps because they provide a comfortable and fun approach to learning. Of course, the graphics and animation are important since you also need to keep your child engaged so they aren't bored. Plus, the quality has to be good so you're not constantly having to reset the app for your child. I can say that Alphabet Aquarium delivers on all counts! I tried the free version, and after a play session, I upgraded. This app really makes learning the ABC's and letter sounds fun. Definitely worth 5 stars!!!",1

Review: [[VIDEOID:d813acb666ea55551bce99548e64dd3d]] TL/DR: After running for about 30 minutes on battery power, the unit stopped working. Regardless of charge state, it will not play sounds. It seems like defective firmware.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o None<br /><br />Cons:<br />o Does not work<br /><br />The documentation on this device says that it has a charging light that appears above the power button. I tried to verify some of the states of this button by running the unit on battery until it was out of power.

"Title: GARBAGE!!! 3 died in less than 2 years
Review: EDIT/UPDATE: Monitor replacement #3 in two years has also just died! As if a toddler and new born aren’t enough to wake you up all hours of the night, let’s add in blaring alerts that the monitor battery is dying, despite the fact that it plugged in. This monitor is garbage and not a single apology or customer service effort has been made from VTech....<br /><br />I received one of these for my Baby Shower and it lasted about 11 months before it started having issues, and 13 months before it died completely (1 month outside of warranty, of course). I purchased this as a replacement on March 3rd and it died two days ago (April 24th). I am very unhappy that both times this monitor has completely stopped working!!!",0
"Title: What you see is NOT what you get.
Review: The Mickey shown is not the Mickey that you will receive. What you will receive is a poorly cut Mickey where the glove has no white inside at all. The eyes also are different, they have no white inside of them but the pupils. I contacted the seller when I received it and asked for the decal to be corrected or refunded... They told me to send it back for a refund, which tells me they can't do the decal that is actually shown.  Lastly, the size of the sticker as stated is very deceiving. It may be almost 6 inches wide but it's barely 2 inches tall.",0

Review: My children and I have trouble falling and staying asleep, and as a result we've been using another brand of Melatonin as a sleep aid. We use half of a 3mg pill and it has been very effective. Ever since I purchased this product a week ago I have been having more trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Last night I woke twice and then woke an hour early. My children are having similar problems. I'm going to try This product is just not as effective, even though the dose would appear to be the same. I'm going to try increasing our dosage, but we shouldn't have to do that if the label is to be trusted and these are, in fact, 3mg pills. I guess the FDA doesn't regulate melatonin!",0
"Title: What were they thinking
Review: These switches have small terminals with rectangular holes that are definitely designed for soldered wires, not push on connectors. However, the melting point of the plastic that the terminals are imbedded in is barely higher than solder so if you intend to use these the way they were designed for your soldering skills better be above average because two seconds too long with the iron and the switch body melts. I strongly suggest tinning your wire first and being as quick as you can. Actually I suggest avoiding these all together and spend a little more money for something better. I bought 4 different colors and they are all the same.",0
"Title: Perfect and super bright light bulb that lights up my garage now
Review: I have a double car garage with one light bulb in the middle of it and one at the door to exit it. Plus both automated garage door openers have some light bulbs in them as well that I can turn on. But to be honest this garage is always a bit dark if the doors are closed. If I ever have to look for something, or if I take the cars out and do some simple maintenance work on the bikes like replace the batteries, the light is always insufficient so I usually have to wait for a sunny day and do anything in the afternoon when the light hits.<br /><br />So when I saw this light bulb, I figured it was time to check it out and see if this would help. LED bulbs are known to be bright and also energy saving so I figured I had nothing to loose. Of cour",1
"Title: Protesting Tooooooo Much
Review: I was hoping THIS would be the book that offered plausible, objective theories as to who may have committed this crime and why they may have done so. Instead I got 462+ pages of &#34;The Ramsey's are innocent because their legal dream team says they're innocent.&#34; No investigation of disgruntled employees, no details about family friends or acquaintances who may have kept hidden shady or criminal pasts. We're told over and over and over again WHY the Ramsey's DIDN'T do it, and why it's unfair, inept, bumbling, corrupt, and evil for law enforcement to continue to keep them on a list of suspects.<br /><br />I should've realized what a pro-Ramsey piece this was going to be when the Prologue consists of a leisurely conversation the author ha",0
"Title: Terrific Craftsmanship
Review: This is a GREAT quality cahier cover. Just terrific craftsmanship - can't imagine this falling apart in my lifetime. The leather is just right - not so stiff that you can't close it but not so floppy that you couldn't write well if you were just holding it in front of you. Pen holder is well-secured and made of the same stuff my old $100 daytimer used. Mine has 3 business card sized slots on the left as well as a pocket for miscellany (I guess you could insert a 2nd cahier there as well). And, not for nothing, these come from North Carolina which is a bonus.",1
"Title: PooFection :)
Review: All I need to say about the Rhinoflex is Buy It! It fits perfectly into our sewer tube on our trailer and this is the first time that I have had anything other than the old style blue hose. Wow! What a difference. The best part of this is that when I take it out of the tube it is still in its collapsed stage and I only have to open it up as much as I need, which is usually maybe 8 feet to the sewer drain. Having the caps on both ends really makes it nice to handle because you know that what's inside - stays inside until you need to dump it. Because it is strong and holds its straightened ability, washing it out is quick and easy. When we are using full hookups I also install it on top of this - http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006IX7Y2/ref=sr_ph?",1

"Title: Instructions would be helpful
Review: This is a great set, but the instructions leave a lot to be desired. Here are some tips for anyone struggling with the covers and knuckle straps:<br /><br />Attach the bottom part of the knuckle strap first after removing the original strap. Then, reattach the cover.<br />Cover the controller with the silicone cover, sliding just the bottom part of the knuckle strap through the bottom.<br />Then, attach the top part of the knuckle strap by sliding the controller through the loop.<br />First, adjust the velcro, then adjust the loop so that it is partially over the front panel and not obstructing the trigger button. It seems like this will slip, at first, but doesn't seem to in practical use.<br />Finally, attach the strap by looping it throu",1

Review: There are 12 sheets of good quality wrapping paper in this set in 4 different styles of 3 sheets each style. The design is typical and basic Christmas wrap.<br /><br />There are no guide marks on the back for cutting but the sizing is good enough for small to medium gifts. The paper is neither thick nor thin; it is the perfect thickness in my opinion.<br /><br />The current price of $8.99 ($9.99 minus 10%) comes to a very reasonable $.75 cents per sheet. This is good quality paper for the price as other paper similar to this is usually priced higher.",1

Review: I received this espresso maker back in June of 2013. It does make really good espresso. But now it's only 5 months later and it's already broken. The steamer works but no coffee comes out.

"Title: Perfect!!
Review: While waiting for my laminator to arrive, I decided to manually lay a single sheet over my stickers to waterproof them. You simply remove one perforated edge, then line it up to your page. Then, simply begin peeling away the backing while simultaneously pressing down and rubbing back and forth until you cover the sheet. I fed it into my Silhoutte Cameo cutter and the results were gorgeous., The last clear vinyl I used came on a roll that had to be cut down to A4 size each time, and required patience and insane precision, because if you even blinked, there would be an air bubble which required an anvil squash it out. Now I  can't wait to try some cold lamination once my unit comes in to let the rollers do their thing instead of manual hand p",1

Review: This is a giant bag that you can stick into your regular bag when not in use. The bag it folds into isn’t attached. Folding the big bag into the little bag is really easy. The little bag then snaps into the big bag as a side pocket when your using the big bag. It is very sturdy. The fabric is a little loud with rustling. It is great for shopping, particularly at the farmers’ market. It also makes a good bag to take to a picnic or something where you’ll use what is in the bag and then you don’t have this massive bag full of nothing to deal with. It is super convenient. The small bag is about the size of a makeup bag.",1

Review: This book was one heck of a ride! You start off with one very moving first chapter that gets you.. hook, line and sinker! The rest of the pages fly by at an (pleasantly) alarming rate as the author whisks you along on a rollercoaster of a ride. I experienced every emotion as I flipped from page to page, unwilling to interrupt the story for such a needless thing such as sleep. The author is SO good with her descriptions that I couldn't help but feel everything Emma was going through. It was as if I was Emma. Superb accomplishment, Cameo! Cover to cover took me just under five hours.. thank God for days off work! I just purchased the next book and cannot wait to join Emma, Kade and the rest of the troupe on the next step in this amazing tale!",1

Review: I had another set that the outer shell seemed rather fragile.  They worked okay but when plugging them in or removing them, I had to worry about them cracking or something.  These are sturdier and I'm extremely pleased with them.  Now I am not a traditional guitar player so I can't talk to those who would use them with their regular electric guitars.  I play both lap steel guitars (have two) and keyboard.  I have two keytars (and Alessis Vortex and a Roland Lucina) that work GREAT with this ""wireless guitar system"" meaning it works with other instruments as well.

Review: I have used Acrobat forever when it comes to PDF's.  I use it at work and use the reader version at home.  the reader has always worked well for me at home and the full acrobat version allows some modifications to stuff I am working at in the office.  I've never had any real issues with either product with the exception of 2 areas.  First, Acrobat is not known for being a secure program.  This is very well known in the tech world so most security type people will not use Acrobat for their PDF purposes.  Second, the amount of updates the Acrobat does and its ability to keep adding itself to the Windows startup dumbfounds me.  No matter how many times I turn off auto updates and remove it from my startup, it always finds a way to turn itself ",1

Review: We played the newer king candy version when we were away on vacation and found it in the cottage game cupboard. My 3 year old was obsessed. Asked for it for Christmas and got this version. It is beyond boring. The squares are tiny and there aren't as many fun paths and bonus squares etc so it takes way longer and nothing happens. We have been able to get through an entire game once. The rest of the times I have to flip through the deck and smuggle the ice cream float card to sneak into the pile for my child to pick up so that this can end. I don't really care what pictures are on the board only that it's fun. This is not. New version is more fun and if you don't like that there are other fun board games for toddlers.

Review: I'd wanted a powerup kit for a long time. Saw the FPV version and instaordered (even with the absurd price). Full throttle and it won't climb. Part throttle, gentle toss, WON'T CLIMB. Every combination, every variation in elevator position, can't get this thing to do anything other than beep and crash. Alarm keeps going off. Just doesn't fly. Followed the video instruction exactly. It's what I expected after opening the box. It's HEAVY and way too big. I'll try to fold the other plane design later. But this was a colossal letdown. WAAAY too expensive for what you get. The only thing we found amusing in the kit was the google cardboard. Which is fun! But using with this FPV powerup seems gimmicky at best.

Review: I purchased this mirror for the Sora Brake/Shifters on my 10 year old Trek 1200. It took quite a while for me to install this mirror and for a few rides it worked good. The bad part is that it had to be adjusted quite often on rough roads. The ugly part happened as a result of rough roads. It may be because the bike is all aluminum and very unforgiving but it cracked the button off the brake/shifter where the mirror arm attaches. I can't recommend this to anyone who rides on rough roads unless you have a buttery smooth riding bike. Rough roads are a way of life here in Chicagoland.",0

Review: Jake Russell and Erin Bass meet through his sister Ivy, who is also Erin's best friend and have an instant chemistry. But Erin breaks her hard and fast rule. That is, if she stepped outside the lines to have a one night stand, she is better off hooking up with a stranger. Erin has been burned before, she has the broken heart to prove it, and she especially doesn't do football players. So when Erin wakes up with Jake still in her bed she kicks him to the curb, before he does it to her, after their most memorable one night stand.

Review: Yes this thing is crazy powerful. My fiance used this to convert a turkey fryer and ran a line out from our house gas. We used it to boil down maple sap from our trees to make maple syrup. The first time, he fell asleep on the couch. When I walked to the other end of the house I could smell burning sugar (a horrid smell) and ran outside. It had carbonized the syrup and burnt out the bottom of the pan.

Review: The housing is light cheap plastic. If you tighten the screws too tight the plastic will break. If you take a spill on your bike. This bike light will break off somewhere. I included a photo of a metal piece sticking out of the battery compartment. The metal contact would not allow the battery compartment to fit back into the light housing. I pulled the opposite side battery and pushed the battery terminal back into place. But once I put in the opposite side battery, the terminal would be pushed out. I was forced to use a pair of pliers and squeezed this terminal back into place. It took me about 10 minutes to get this to fit. But this just barely allowed the battery compartment and light fit with each other. Costing $9 this is one of those",0

I'm returning printer but am stuck with opened packages of ABS material. 3d printing is amazing but this product seems like it was rushed out. Simple things like the recessed SD card slot makes it impossible to use. Every print had excess stringy parts which I read would be fixed with an e3d hot end but I feel with the price of the printer, it should work out of the box.",0
"Title: What's Included Is Good - But It's Lacking
Review: For anyone wanting to purchase this book to build their first guitar I would caution you.  Benedetto enjoys a ton of notoriety for his work, but as a writer he falls pretty short.  The book is incredibly short on details, and has mostly black and white photos, though they are at least glossy.  Also disappointing is the fact that major portions of the process are omitted.  For instance, the reader is directed to carve the back plate in the same manner as the top is carved; however, the arching templates included with the book differ.  That shouldn't be suspect, except as others have noted - not even the back templates work/match with each other. This portion was omitted from the VHS/DVD set as well.  Still, it is a resource worth having.  If",0

Review: This used to be the best food. The broth was light and colorful, the shreds and chunks of liver and chicken were golden and it didn't smell too bad and it was the absolute favorite food of my picky feline. However, a few months ago I got five boxes of different food - the broth was thick and gluggy and colorless like the chicken and the liver. It smelt so bad. The cat hated it and so did I! I contacted the supplier who was sorry and Natural Balance. Nothing could be done, inconsistencies happen, you get what you get, you can't select the Lot Numbers of your order. So I ordered from another supplier and all the boxes were perfect - phew!!! The second order, I got two boxes of food as expected and three boxes of the awful smelly stuff. Clearl",0
"Title: Horrible Instructions - Defective Parts
Review: I was unable to tighten one of the carriage bolts/lock nut for the caster, as the hole was improperly cut (see enclosed picture).  Hard to fit a square peg in a half square/half round hole, and then tighten the lock nut.  Additionally, the instructions are sorely lacking.<br /><br />It is industry practice to include pictures of the parts with the parts list.  Most people don't know the difference between a Cross Head Screw M6X25 and a Leg Screw 6x18mm without a picture.<br /><br />The ""tools required"" list doesn't not include a wrench.  How would someone tighten the lock nut to the bolt while assembling the caster if they don't have a wrench?<br /><br />Why would you not include an instruction for how to use the Leg Square Nut?  Took me 20",0

But end result my sweet baby looks like the star he is again and it was so easy! He didn't squeak once fearing tugs on tangles because there weren't painful moments. To achieve this you must go slow and bond with your pet. Take breaks and make brushing a pleasant experience over a few days until the pet is fully clear of mats, tangles and shedded hair.",1
"Title: Awkward and difficult to use.
Review: The plastic handle with the roller cover is very difficult to use. The cover slides down over the roller and has to be constantly repositioned. The sticky sheets are nearly impossible to remove after use and your hands are exposed to the hair, dirt and lint that could be picked up. The edge of the sheets are pointed and difficult to grasp. The only way I was able to lift the pointed corner was by using a straight edge to scrape loose the point. I  am returning the unused box and giving away the box I unfortunately opened.",0
"Title: Waste of money and time to install/uninstall
Review: This game is a waste of money.  Both Fallout and Fallout 2 are equally bad, and because of that have no desire to even investigate Fallout Tactics.  Archaic graphics, looks ugly on Windows 7 and newer computers even when running in XP compatibility mode, and game apparently has no method for adjusting screen resolution or improving graphics.  Games look like what you might see on a hand-held gameplayer from 10 years ago (a bad one).  This package also comes with no documentation on installing and gameplay; and the readme's are useless in that regard.  Cannot recommend this game for any reason.",0
"Title: Perfect size -- fits in pants pocket (in its protective shell) -- and great screen and cameras
Review: This is one of the very few high-end phones that does not feel like a shrunken tablet, but like a real phone....  (It's a real shame that the S11 no longer comes in that form factor.)  The screen looks better than that of the ""full-size"" cousins in the S10 line (density is higher), it fits my hand just so, and is easily stuck in my jeans' side pocket -- no need for a cumbersome phone holder on my belt.  The main camera and landscape camera are both excellent, work well in bright exposure situations (although you should use ""pro"" mode, as the automatic calibrations are somewhat dubious).<br />Signal capture is very good (crucial for me, as I live in Hawaii, where coverage is quite poor), wifi performance is great, and battery life is decent ",1

Review: The main character is unlikeable. Throughout the book Queenie baffles us as to why she dates white men--she reminds us every chance she gets that she thinks white people are dirty-- they don't use bleach, they don't remove their shoes in the house, and she even believes it is ""cultural"" when her white roommate improperly discards a dirty sanitary napkin. At a new school, Queenie seeks out black people "" in a sea of white faces"", but she only dates white men.  Her white boyfriend's family is openly racist, but she keeps dating him. Queenie is a confused mess. I don't like her at all. Oh, and she's easy af, just ask the white men she worships.",0

"Title: Easy to install; lights the way
Review: We have a newish concrete walk leading from the front driveway to the side patio. The issue is a curved edge with a slight drop-off that could sprain an ankle if one missed a step.  That's why I chose the VIRIDI Solar Landscape Lights. I read all the information and thought this was the perfect safety measure for the curved walk.  I  installed them quickly and easily myself. They went in yesterday afternoon and I waited to take pics tonight. They're not as bright as the picture shows; however, they are the perfect light for that area.  Now I don't have to worry about straying too far at the edge of the walk.",1
"Title: Doesn't even fully cover active part of screen
Review: I tend to be a bit obsessive about the fit and positioning of screen protectors, but that being said this is the first time I have outright been disgusted by one. I have bought several from this company for other phones that were nice, so this came as a complete surprise. This doesn't even reach to both side edges of the active part of the screen. It rests just inside the lines on both sides if you align it as evenly as possible and it took me two tries (two protectors) to even get it on that well. Horrible fit that quite literally falls short. This is not the protector you are looking for. It doesn't even come close to a decent fit, let alone a good one. My advise is to keep looking.",0
"Title: Look elsewhere
Review: I don't typically write reviews but I'm unhappy enough with this product to share my frustrations with prospective buyers. I was really psyched to replace my kitchen faucet with a gooseneck one, but his one has some serious usability issues. The handle is very 'touchy' and takes a few moments each time we turn the water on in order to find that 'just right' spot where the water is sufficiently hot, but any slight nudge results in an extreme temperature shift, shooting the water temp to scalding in seconds if accidentally bumped to the left. The placement of the faucet just left of center to accommodate our double sink makes it darn near impossible to wash any larger items (serving platter, cutting board, cookie sheet, etc.) without banging ",0
"Title: Otherwise Known as Possum  by Maria D. Laso
Review: Ages 8 to 12. Beautifully told story set in Herbert Hoover depression era southern Appalachia circa 1932.  Our resilient heroine is 11 year old LizBetty “Possum” Porter, her mother has died in childbirth and the new teacher, a Yankee!, wants her to attend school. Until her mother died she had been home schooled. The story arch takes place over the fall semester and Christmas. The novel is told by Possum which makes it even more delectable. The story spotlights her youthful idealism and who can resist a kid who drink Orange Nehi?. Her friends June May, Tully and stuck-up (now there's a word I have not thought of in decades - lol) Mary Grace round out her life.<br /><br />Sadly, the debut author passed away while in final edits for this title",1

Those Orcs are not going to kill themselves, so this allows a wider area of movement with the mouse to really show off your chops.<br /><br />It is thick enough to lay perfectly flat, and cushions the keyboard, the mouse, and the numpad well.

"Title: Lovely tea that is a great combination of ginger and pear
Review: The only way I usually like ginger is in ginger ale but I think I found another one. In this box you get a total of 6 boxes and each contains 16 bags, giving you a total of 96 bags. All that costs you less than $35, so not a bad deal I think. I also tried using a tea bag twice and that worked perfectly fine so you could actually get double out of each making this an even better deal.<br /><br />I was not sure what to expect from the ginger flavor since ginger at times can be a bit harsh but I was pleasantly surprised. The tea was exceptionally pleasant and I think it was the perfect addition of the pear to the mix that really did it. This tea is very smooth and lovely really. I for one really like this combination a lot which was a bit of a",1

Review: For all the years I've been cooking I've been complaining to my husband about the quality of chicken breasts and how they don't cook up well and end up being stringy and tough. Well I've finally been introduced to ""brining"" which takes your cooking to the next level. Never in my life have I tasted such succulent chicken. Sure it took 12 hours of brining (salt water plus herbs) to get the right flavor but it was so worth the effort.<br /><br />It might seem like a lot of work and where do you find space in your refrigerator? Well I solved that problem by cutting off the tops of two milk jugs. It was just enough room for one cut up chicken. I halved the recipe for the brine and divided it up between the milk jugs. Then I added the chicken and",1

Review: These Nooie smart plugs are small and take up only one outlet so you can plug in a second one or a plug for another device in the same double outlet. However, after considerable time, I was unable to connect these smart plugs using their Android app. Once you install their app, you must sign up for an account to use it. The instructions in the included manual do not match the app. One option was to allow Bluetooth to discover the smart plugs automatically, but it required me to divulge my location (I rarely allow this). I manually allowed my phone to discover the smart plugs, and they both showed up innocuously as “YT”, so OK, I renamed them. However, I could never connect after multiple attempts.

"Title: Snark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic Tuner
Review: I bought this Snark tuner for my daughter to use to tuner her classical guitar and her guitarlele.  I've been using a blue Snark tuner for a couple of years and have loved it.  I thought she needed a Snark of her own and it works like a charm.  I like the chromatic aspect of it because you can tune your strings to any pitch other than concert pitch.  Sometimes we like to go lower, and sometime a whole or half-step higher.<br /><br />It's beautiful to look at, clips on the head of the instrument with soft rubber feet, and truly does an excellent job of tuning.  I teach classical guitar and have found this tuner to be one I go to the most, and I have a lot of different tuners.  I rarely use any of my other tuners anymore, relying mostly on th",1

Review: I bought this filament because I like the color and I've had luck in the past with Amazon basics products. However, this filament is absolutely not worth the price. It does not come in vacuum sealed packaging so who knows how long it's been sitting in the warehouse letting moisture get in. It did not print well at all. It wouldn't adhere properly even with raising temps, the quality of the filament was not good at all compared to other brands I've used.

I should have realized there would be a problem with it because Hodge was advertising it as a swab that can be used to swab out the instrument without taking the neck off. In order to achieve this the silk material is too small. It is superb for just the neck but for the rest of the instrument it is totally inadequate, I am now looking for a &#34;beefier&#34; swab that I can use for the main body of th",0
"Title: I like Eufy, just not this model
Review: Let me say first of all that we have had a Eufy Robovac 30 for several years, and honestly, I am happy with it. It was my husband's idea to look for a new vacuum that had enough suction to pick up cat litter. (He'd seen one in an ad on TV.) Since we don't even have a cat, that requirement seemed silly, but I told him I'd see what I could find. I read many articles reviewing robot vacuums and then read lots of reviews from owners of the top vacuums. I didn't want my husband buying one of the most expensive models, but maybe I could find something in the mid-price range with good reviews. Believe it or not, the reviews led me to another Eufy - this time the 11s MAX. When it arrived, I charged it, read the booklet, and finally set it free to s",0
"Title: Great Fun and Not as Simple as it Looks!
Review: I got this game for Christmas and just started playing as a part of my weight-loss program, and I have to say this: The game is enjoyable and not as simple as it looks! I am working muscles I didn't know I had! The only complaint I have is that there is a small selection of music to dance to, but the different games are fun to play. I've played it three times already, and I don't ever want to stop playing! I hope a new game comes along that is similar to this with more song choices, if so, I'd be a happy girl!<br /><br />I am still holding out hope a K-pop dance game will come into existence, but until then, this is great!",1
"Title: #1 the price is great, so I bought 2
Review: I already have one Warner no side effects with front closure, but that wasn't available at Amazon in my size so I decided to try a back closure. #1 the price is great, so I bought 2. #2 the fit was perfect, if you haven't tried the &#34;No Side Effects&#34; bra, I promise you won't be disappointed. All budges are gone. As long as I have this extra flab to deal with I will never buy any other bra. #3 and the real reason I'm leaving a review, is the way they were packaged. They arrived 2 days later is a BOX. They were absolutely perfect, I'm very impressed and I will definitely be back for more. Amazon, you rock!",1
"Title: Used to be the best, now Chinese junk!
Review: I've used Trim brand fingernail clippers for over 30 years.  They used to be the only brand worth buying: very inexpensive and excellent quality.<br />Clippers mysteriously disappear over time (kids borrowing them, falling out of my pocket when I pull my keys out, etc) so I needed to buy some new ones recently.  I had to buy over 10 sets before I found one that worked correctly.  Most of them had mismatched ""teeth"", so you couldn't get a clean cut.  After finally finding a few passable sets, I had accumulated around 20 sets that were junk.  I boxed them up and sent them back to the manufacturer.<br /><br />I finally found an old set and then the difference was clear...these used to be made in Korea, now they are made in China.

"Title: Noisy no matter what.
Review: I've tried everything with this filter, but it's still noisy. I have over 40 years in the hobby and have owned at least a dozen canister filters.  None were this noisy.  I've primed using both methods in the instructions.  I've placed the filter on its side so air can escape from the out side (tried in side too).  Reseated the impeller. Removed all media.  Pumped primer while running until no air bubbles come out.  I've been trying to call Penn-Plax support, but the line is always busy.  This is my first Penn-Plax product in many years, sad that it's not working out because other than the noise I like the filter. If I can reach them soon I'll have to return it.  I can't even watch TV in this room, it's that noisy.<br /><br />Updated to 1 st",0

Review: I normally don't buy things from Amazon I may have to return because it's just a hassle to me.  I should have stood by that and skipped on this umbrella.  I couldn't find the color I wanted at Walmart so took a chance.<br />Material is extremely thin.  I don't expect it to last the rest of this season.  I should have just bought from Walmart even though it wasn't the color I was looking for; $10 cheaper and much better quality.  The one I currently have has lasted over 10 years because they come in a cloth bag you can use for storage when you aren't using it, which is what I do.  Couldn't wait to get these now just disappointed.",0

Review: I bought these because my son always pees out of his diaper, he has since he was an infant.  Now he is a toddler and still does and it wakes him at night.  So after reading the reviews I bought a pkg and tried them during naps. I just don't get the product I guess.  It is literally a cheap maxi pad without the plastic bottom with the sticky strip. It does not wick the moisture away so it's just a cotton pad that gets soaked and heavy.  It was so uncomfortable for him he ended up waking from nap time earlier than he normally does.  I would not recc them.",0
"Title: Burned my eyes many times
Review: I really wanted to like this product. I like the design of the little cleaning bottle and seeing the bubbles floating up during cleaning make the product looks very convincing. Unfortunately, this product has burned my eyes on and off many many times! At first, I thought maybe it was my eyes getting too exhausted from lack of sleep ( I’m a mom of two young boys) or something like that, but no....even when I had a solid 8 hours sleep, this stuff still severely irritated my eyes once I put on my contact lenses after numerous time of thourough rinsing with saline solution. I’m giving up on another experiment today and just tossed out the product into my recycling bin. Not worth hurting my eyes!!!",0
"Title: Dead when I needed them, even with good batteries
Review: It doesn't matter how good these are new out of the box. If they don't work after sitting in your car, they're useless. I loaded these with Energizer Lithium batteries, which can tolerate the heat and cold of the trunk. But when I needed to use the beacons after about 18 months, though, two of the three didn't work.<br /><br />It's that simple: YOU CANNOT RELY ON THESE TO WORK AFTER SITTING IN YOUR TRUNK OR GLOVE COMPARTMENT. (When I got home I checked the batteries -- they were still AOK. But the switches on two of the beacons didn't work.)<br /><br />I've switched back to the old-fashioned magnesium flares. They just need to be kept dry (think Ziplock bag) and they will last years in the trunk. Electronic 'flares' like these, even with gr",0
"Title: Extremely versatile
Review: An extremely versatile product. I bought them because I was looking for washable, heat-resistant material that could be cut-to-size to make a cover for my griddle.<br />I use the griddle for many items and most of them either splatter or need a lid to hold in the heat for steaming or Browning.<br />I have tried screen-type splatter guards, but they are too porous.<br />These grill magic liners produce excellent results when you want eggs Sunnyside up and gently basted. I cut one sheet to overlap my griddle. I can touch it without getting burned while the food is cooking, and it locks in enough steam to cook things like fried potatoes and leftover pizza while leaving the bottom crisp.",1

"Title: Perfect for capers
Review: I purchase my olives fresh from a deli olive bar so have to admit that I have never used this spoon for olives. However, this is an indispensable tool for spooning out capers from those narrow 3.75 ounce jars such as the ones these capers are packed in:  [[ASIN:B004T345GO Mediterranean Organic Wild Capers Non-Pareil -- 3.5 oz]].<br /><br />The spoon end fits inside one of those jars that are impossible for any other implement other than a butter knife (which does not really work). Prior to investing in this spoon I would either fish out the capers with a knife blade - invariably spilling some and the brine on the floor or table - or I would dump the contents into a small bowl and use a teaspoon to add them to salads. Those days are gone.<br",1
"Title: Not happy at all ...
Review: I LOVED this comforter when I first got it, and after I first washed it.  It was gorgeous, soft, and felt like it would keep us warm.  However, with that said, we've had it a total of a month or so and it looks absolutely horrible.  We've found that the quilted threads are very lightweight and any little movement against them tends to break it ... so ... it doesn't look new anymore.  I noticed, right away, that my ring liked to catch the threads so I was very careful but my husband tore the stitching up, in multiple places, just sitting carefully on it.  This is a quilt ... they should have used heavy-duty thread when making the design, not the lightweight thread.  Very disappointed that it cost so much and looked so beautiful when we got i",0
"Title: Don't Buy These
Review: After using these at the gym for about 3 weeks, the music started cutting out while I was listening to them. I made sure they were charged, tried them again and still had some crackling, and then the next week they started to automatically shut off about 45 minutes after using them. Even with a full charge, they did this every day. I asked about returning them and it was conveniently 5 days after the return window closed. So basically, if you have any issues with these more than a few weeks after you get them, you're screwed. Save your money and do not buy these.",0

Review: This game is really fun BUT....you can't play unless you are willing to spend a lot of real money. Every upgrade cost a lot of gold bars, however you only earn one gold bar here and there. There is no way to upgrade without spending money and you can't beat the levels as they get higher without upgrading. Also there are a lot of cool restaurants but you can't unlock them unless you buy more gold bars.<br />For this reason I'm out....if they ever decide to just sell the game I'll look into playing it.

Review: This is the second book of Katherine Arden’s Winterlight Trilogy.<br /><br />In the first book of the Winterlight Trilogy, “The Bear and the Nightingale"", our young heroine, Vasilisa (Vasya) Petrovna, lived in Lesnaya Zemlaya, a small village in northern Russia (Rus) on the edge of the wilderness.

"Title: Don't buy this book.  If you have to read it, steal it.
Review: Bill Mason is, indeed, a master thief and is also a very good story teller. The first third of the book, where he describes his thieving, is very entertaining, although in a creepy way. Any titillation that I got from the clever mechanics of his &#34;work&#34; were quickly shot all to hell when I realized how he was affecting his victims. No matter how artfully done, there is absolutely no justification for his actions.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: Thankfully, he gets himself shot during a fairly routine heist and almost dies. But doesn't. Then he gets arrested and his life starts to seriously fall apart. This section of the book is tedious and reveals just how repulsive this smooth-talking jerk is. Just because you confess to being a jerk and",0
"Title: Great size; nice build quality; looks nice
Review: This is a great option for when you need a larger trash can than the usual ""standard"" size office can but don't want it to stick out too much. It's taller than the standard size but with a similar footprint, so it blends in pretty well. The build quality is solid with the can having a good heft and durability. The grey color is very nice -- it's a bit darker grey than usual which is a major plus for blending in but not looking overly drab.<br /><br />No complaints at all. It's a nice step up from a standard size without being too big for an office.",1

"Title: Doesn't Fit
Review: I purchased these filters because the listing states they are compatible, and a direct replacement for the LG water filter - LG1000P . The small round internal connector is a different design from the LG OEM so it cannot be installed. If you purchase this product do not try to force it because you will damage the LG refrigerator connection. If you view side-by-side the internal design of the Waterdrop filter with the original LG filter it is quite obvious the Waterdrop will not fit. I returned these, thank you Amazon! This was the second order I placed with Amazon to replace the LG filter. The first order did not work either. I went to Home Depot and they had a Home Depot brand with 2 cartridges. At this point, I was skeptical, but I decide",0

Review: I really wasn't sure what to expect with this  I wanted something that was shelf-stable that would work for tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc.  I also have some health issues that pose some challenges for shopping and cooking, so I'm always looking for things that will simplify meal preparation but don't fall within the ""junk food"" category.

So I just used it like i would use any other exfoliator. The scent of it is very mild but lovely and I really like it. Once you rinse it of it all goes away though sadly.

Well, after pulling the battery 'tag' out of the handle, the gun worked great--for about 2 mins. upon which it began slowing, dimming and sound got lower...batteries were obviously sitting in this thing awhile! Bought brand new batteries and the gun worked for about 5 pulls of the trigger-then NOTHING.

Amazing!<br /><br />I like the designs on the front and pack cover. The spine has some leather string woven into it, which is another nice touch. The only minor complaint I have is with the leather string that is attached used to keep the journal shut. Its long...very long when not in use.

The plastic is so cheap that if you so much as look at it wrong the threads holding the body together flex apart and the batteries go flying.  The bulb is dim and incandescent and lasted all of 4 uses before it burned out.  A replacement bulb is a third of a cost of a new light.

The sound is not outstanding, but good enough for gaming and the microphone was sensitive enough to pick up my speaking.<br />However, just 4 weeks after purchase, both the headset and the microphone are not working properly. Sound in the right ear is sporadic and goes up and down, I believe due to poor wiring, and the microphone works about 70% of the time as well.<br />I'd understand a year+ of use wearing it down, but not 4 weeks.

Review: Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean.<br /><br />The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.<br /><br />While many may see the color as ""Azure"" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what lo",1

Review: At last!  A quality digger that you can apply pressure to that will not bend or break.  I admit, I am pretty tough on my gardening tools.  This has come thru a very busy season digging thru clay soils and has handled all jobs perfectly.  It has a longer handle than most and the handle is offset from the blade.  This is a different design than the standard and works really well, more like a mini shovel, when you need to apply a little leverage.  I thought it might be a little awkward, but I didn't even notice it when digging to plant bulbs.  Very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.",1

I tried adjusting the feet screws and adding different thicknesses of boards under the machine, making sure the load was well balanced,  but nothing worked.... until I tried these. Made a huge difference and very easy to add under the machine's feet. These are simple 2 piece pads that go under each of the machines 4 feet. The bottom is a hard rubber type pad that locks into the part B riser section for the machine's feet. . It is not clear to me why you get so many extra part B's risers since I can not imagine using more than one but major kudos to the inventor.",1
"Title: Great rubber!!!
Review: My old tire deformed (it was made by continental).....was causing vibrations on the front wheel to the point where I had to slow down on the turns, unsafe. Researched for a good tire that has good everyday usability and that can put miles. Read reviews and vey happy I went with this choice. I had Battlax in the rear and I am happy how it performs so knew it would be good buy. But I will say even more that front tire is even more important on the bike than rear. As soon as I put this tire instead of the deformed Continental I felt like I just bought myself a new bike. On the straight the steering is solid and not a shake as I had before. Turns are awesome lean the bike all the way and feel very confident. Very satisfied with!!! Good price.",1
"Title: Not accurate at all at lower alcohol levels. Disappointing
Review: Unfortunately, the one I received is completely inaccurate. I followed all the calibration directions.<br /><br />It works OK for high percentage alcohols. With store bought liquors that are 40% alcohol, the reading came in consistently at 36% with four different liqours(vodka, rum, whiskey, and tequila)<br /><br />On lower percentage alcohol such as beer this is USELESS! This is what I purchased it for, so accuracy is necessary. I wanted to be able to check the percentage of my home brew. The first home brew I tried said it was 20% and it was likely around 8%. I then tried several store bought beers ranging from 4-7% and none tested below 10% with this Refractometer. I did make sure to let the beer get to room temp before testing as in the",0
"Title: Very Attractive Belt
Review: I purchased this belt because it looked attractive and fit my needs. After I had worn it a few times I noticed that I was allergic to the metals used in the manufacturing process of the buckle. So, I decided to remove the buckle from the leather belt, clamp the buckle to be suspended in the air, placed a safety tray with a screen underneath and grabbed my map gas and torch. In theory, I was going to burn away the allergins, repolish and then reattach to belt.<br />It did not work out as I had planned (see photos)<br />Immediately, after the application of heat, the buckle started to make a popping noise, turned bright green and large amounts of liquid pot metal began to flow out of the buckle and onto the tray.<br />CONCLUSION<br />The buck",0

Review: ""Eating less will not make you weigh less."" ~ Zoe Harcombe<br /><br />Imagine one day you woke up and found out nearly everything you had been told about dieting and exercising was wrong. Zoe Harcombe does exactly this. She explains why twenty things you've been told are actually myths. Worried about saturated fats? Worried about high cholesterol? Did you know you could die without enough cholesterol? Reading this book made me want to read [[ASIN:B005OM0DBU The Obesity Epidemic: What Caused It? How Can We Stop It?]].

"Title: vermont cheddar-- in powder form. Versatile, tasty, good for working pantry & long term
Review: It is an 8 ounce container. It is as expected--small. Products containers are filled based on weight, not volume so I think the physical size of the container is appropriate.<br /><br />Taste is delicious. I dont use it often, but I like having products like this on hand for its versatile use and tasty cheesy flavor. I have ordered it a few times, usually when on sale. Sometimes it arrives quickly, other times it has taken way longer than what was reasonable. Not sure if it matters that some orders came from warehouse. No idea.

"Title: El Lame'o
Review: This thing reminds me of the third Highlander; it even had the requisite sex scene at the most cliched moment. The Prophecy was original enough to not even need a romantic relationship. Walken and the autopsy guy are in this, but the rest of the original cast isn't...including Viggo Mortensen's totally awesome Lucifer, now played by some second rate actor...actually, everyone else in this is second rate. They also overuse the cool ideas from the first like the perching, the kissing two fingers thing, Gabriel's ""shoosh"" with a finger under their nose, etc, so that it feels like a bad TV series adaptation. The dynamic range of the sound is really wanky too, probably the reason that Sci-Fi and Horror Academy liked it so much. Geeky horror guys",0
"Title: Big disappointment
Review: Big disappointment. The Mini Chalkboard comes attached to the post but not to the stand. The holes in the stands were too small for the poles. I needed these for the next day or I could have made the holes bigger and glued the posts in place. I knew these were small but I could only fit 2 or 3 letters on the chalkboards using real chalk, which did come off easily. If I don't just throw them away I see only one solution. I could buy AllyDrew's chalk labels that are very close in size and shape to my chalkboard. Using a chalk pen with the thinnest point available I could write a brief word or two on the chalkboard. Since other customers had mixed reports about getting the chalk pen off, I could recover the chalkboards with the labels. This wo",0

"Title: Super cute tumbler...
Review: This tumbler is very large... much larger than I expected it to be. I holds 30 oz of liquid, but then you add the exterior insulation and stainless steel and it is HUGE. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It makes holding myself to a ""one cup"" coffee habit much more easy to manage. :)  Because the tumbler tapers at the bottom, it still easily fits in my drink holders in my car. I also tried it with ice the other day and it kept the ice in there all day long. So, it definitely works well... hot or cold. One thing to note... as with most insulated tumblers and flasks, it is hand wash only. Overall, I really like it and I would definitely recommend.",1
"Title: Perfect size, but one huge flaw.
Review: As for size this thing is huge and perfect for those wanting to cover their entire seat and create a barrier to the front seat. The only complete let down is the &#34;non-slip&#34; surface. There are only three strips that create the non-slip surface which are only maybe 4&#34; wide. With leather seats they don't stick at all and you end up with essentially a loose blanket on your seat as your dog slides back and forth. Due to this one flaw I will be forced to look at other options because my giant breed dog bunches the seat cover up because of how easy it slips around which easily causes the seat to be exposed again.",0

Review: I bought the six pack after trying one on my ignition button and loving it.  I gave three to friends as gifts and used two more on my volume and tuning dials.  The crystals on the first one and this pack of six were all intact and neatly lined up and the adhesive sticker is strong, my neighbor installed it a little off and said she could not adjust it but still loved the look.  This fit my Navigator ignition button perfectly but was a little small for my volume/tuner buttons and kinda floated over empty space between the button and the edge but the knobs still turned so I applied them anyway.<br />Would buy again for sure.",1
"Title: Completely changed my way of thinking
Review: This book has radically influenced my approach to security risk management.  In the past I had nothing but disdain for any qualitative approach to risk assessment, whether it was for security, project management or disaster recovery.  My philosophy was that if you couldn't produce a probability curve you didn't have the full picture.  The problem with that philosophy is the very people for whom you are doing the assessment typically do not care about probability curves - if they understand them at all.<br />Mr. Peltier's approach, while not as scientific, is far more powerful because it involves all stakeholders through his unique facilitated risk analysis process (FRAP), and produces findings and assessments that are clear and easy for non",1

They come out with so many super cool ones in recent years that are both fun to do and fun to have the end result afterwards. These little pom-pom backpack clips make cute little animal figures with the pom-pom body, and clip-on to a number of things, like window blind pulls, zippers, etc.<br /><br />The instructions were easy to follow, and my six-year-old and I had a blast working on this craft project together. He needed help at a couple of small points but overall was able to do things together with my reading the instructions and guiding his understanding from looking at the pictures.",1

"Title: Very Happy. Highly recommend. Very easy to use.
Review: This pump is a blessing! On a long bike ride with a group, it’s nice to have something other than co2 cartridges that takes about 2 cartridges to inflate a bike tire. With this unit, I had to inflate 3 tires from friends who did not have an air pump with them.<br /><br />Screw on the attached tube from the pump on to the tire tube thread and turn on the pump to inflate. There’s a built-in air gauge to verify your psi in the tube and categories you choose to what you’re inflating so the unit doesn’t over pressurize the air in the tube. That makes it easier.<br /><br />It comes with numerous head attachments for different product and a digital display. It’s small and compact and can be easily carried in a pocket, bag or backpack.<br /><br />A",1
"Title: Hit or Miss
Review: Over the past year and a half I have received three toner cartridges from this company and I wanted them to be a success. Out of the three (one was a free replacement they sent to make up for the first defective one) only one was usable. The other two had different issues. One had worn or defective parts and stopped functioning and the other started leaking toner all over the inside of the printer after only 1/4 - 1/2 usage. I spoke to the company on three occasions regarding these cartridges and had 2 very good experiences with polite and courteous customer service but the last and most recent one was terrible. Very rude and dismissive customer service. The failure rate is too high to justify the savings.",0

Review: My husband is a gamer and our 9 month old is constantly going after his controllers. This teether is a good size and shape for her and she chewed on it for at least 10 minutes when we gave it to her. Once she realized it isn't Daddy's controller, she lost interest but she does enjoy it a day later or so when she forgets that she's had it before. The novelty of most toys wears off very quickly so the fact that she still enjoys this is good. It is easy to clean and small enough to pack in the diaper bag to take on outings.",1

Review: [[VIDEOID:ae3281dd38813633d6e742af21c48b99]] This is a great looking ceramic decoration.  The pump provides a nice steady stream, and the flow rate is adjustable.  I have been using it for a month with no problems.  The water in my container pond was developing a film from lack of surface movement, and this took care of it.  Serves a practical purpose of aeration and water movement, as well as looking great and sounding nice.  I would have liked the tubing to be a little longer for more flexibility on placement.  Also would have liked some filter material to protect the pump.  I put a small mesh drawstring bag around my pump to keep it from taking in particles.<br />This is a bargain for the price I paid here on Amazon.<br />Update:  At the",1

But for many of us- this is so heavily scented that it's offensive. I don't know if it's the heavy scent or what but within 20 minutes of putting it on I felt light headed and my body started aching. Felt like I had the flu! So I showered and got it off and felt better after that. A couple weeks later I tried it again to see if it indeed was the deodorant and had the same horrible symptoms! And Even stupider, a few months later I tried it again and had the same reaction so I just threw them all in the garbage. I can tell you that one time I left it on just to see if it worked even though it made me feel terr",0
"Title: If you drink, you need to be taking a formulation like this
Review: I confess: I probably drink more alcohol than I should. Sometimes none, sometimes more than advised. Can you relate? (I'm sorry, but American politics drives me to drink!) I'm pretty good at eating healthy for the most part, but I do confess I love gin. I took just a plain milk thistle capsule for years, and that seemed to give me some protection from the occasional (or not so occasional) indulgence, but when I ran out I stopped taking it. And I've noticed my liver goes through phases of not being happy and acting up. Just a bad feeling, a nagging almost-pain.<br /><br />When I was offered this Total Liver formulation at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I thought I'd try it because I knew I needed to get back on something to hel",1

They match available sets of cups and bowls in the same colors and while they're marketed for toddlers, people of any age could use them. It's heavy, solid plastic that will last for years and it would take a lot to crack one. I don't think the color will fade, either. Theu're dvided into one large compartment and two smaller ones, like any TV tray but they're smaller and deeper than most and much chunkier. They'd be easy to throw in a bag and take with you and I can see all kinds of people finding them useful.",1

My husband Tom Steininger was her Campaign Manager in 2010 and I was her Secretary.  We were like family to her and will miss her very much.

Review: I've tried a lot of different political magazines and, so far, Current Affairs has been the best.<br /><br />Fact based and unabashedly honest reporting from journalists who put the interests of people before those of the extraordinarily wealthy and corporations. This magazine is a refreshing change from mainstream corporate political magazines which, by nature of their owners/funding sources, are hesitant to unwilling to publish critiques that actually challenge the status quo. The journalists that write for Current Affairs take a critical and unyielding look at mainstream narratives and offer fact-based perspectives on their accuracy, origins, and implications, using satire and comedy to make for an enjoyable reading experience.<br /><br ",1

It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and it’s a light cream that goes on fast and doesn’t leave a greasy residue on my face or hands.<br /><br />The SPF (sun protection factor) rating on the label is the maximum allowed by the FDA (since February 2017).  (There is little evidence that higher numbers provide more protection.

Until recently have just used the video service.  When we got our Echo and were able to pick our tunes we started to get back into music as an active endeavor instead of just background noise.

After using faithfully for over two years, I now only have to apply every third day.  I highly recommend using a cloth for application and dabbing it on, rather than spraying directly on the skin.  Doing so has completely eliminated any discomfort, which, again, was very minor anyway when compared to other brands.

Unfortunately, Yuki does not like this litter at all. For days, she would only pee in it and I noticed she started to hold her poop for a couple of days. I thought perhaps switching to a no grain dental snacks were causing this, but that was not the case. When she couldn't hold it any longer, she would reluctantly go but would leave a HUGE mess by kicking the litter all over the place. Out of spite, perhaps?  Last night when I came home, she went outside the box which she never did before. So to confirm the idea that it might be the litter causing this, I put second",0

Review: I bought this watch a little over a month ago.  I only wear it twice a week, and I store it in a watch storage box.  A few days ago I noticed that an odd shaped split was forming in the center of my band.  Inside I could see some type of powdery substance that didn't look like any type of dust or anything.  The split started forming about 3/4 of an inch above where I clasp it to my wrist, and I wear my watch slightly lose, so there was no stress on it.  The whole goes all the way through, so I know it wasn't punctured as I would have felt that.

Also bought the citrus scent, which at the time was on sale, but since it did not even worked properly, the joke was on me. Absolutely worthless in every sense of the word. At the end, out of sheer frustration, I had the 3 dispensers in one small room for 24 hours, and they barely did the job they were purchased for. This is a seriously mediocre product and should be addressed as one. Needless to say, all 3 dispensers and refills were returned to Costco, and so ended a total worthless experience of a so called good product that turned out to be only hype.

"Title: Beautiful pure spirituals, without the schmaltz
Review: So many covers of spirituals try to impress by larding them up with hundred-strong choruses and banks of strings.  Robeson's pure strong voice and the simple piano accompaniment take you back to the awe-inspiring sources of the music:  African-American slaves dealing with the most awful forms of oppression, with dignity, faith and hope.  This album is a great introduction to spirituals, and also really ROCKS in places.  My daughter's 4th grade Sunday school class had never heard ""Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho"" before, and LOVED IT -- the boys especially wanted to play it over and over!<br /><br />In my opinion, these simple and beautiful arrangements far surpass Robeson's later and more overtly political work -- these songs make the stro",1

Review: Once installed the product is great. Getting the steering column top over the ignition switch is impossible. There is a retaining ring behind the ignition that fits over a lip in the top part of the column cover. You can’t slide the cover over the ignition because of this ring and you need to move the cover upward to have enough room to get at the screws holding the turn signal switch in place. I wound up cutting out a piece in the cover big enough to slide up and over the ignition switch. After removing and replacing the turn signal I put everything back together and glued the piece I cut out back in place to at least make it look like the column wasn’t torn apart. More brilliant GM engineering which makes you return to a dealer to have th",1

I was so excited to try this because I love the original yet it is a little out of my price range. So, I decided to give this a try and I will definitely be buying more! I just can’t believe how identical it is to the original. I am definitely a happy customer. The scent stays with you for a very long time and is so intoxicating. LOVE this product! Awesome job to the company who created this product and I appreciate the opportunity to wear one of my favorite perfumes at a price I can afford! Thank you!",1
"Title: Am I missing something????
Review: Unless something is wrong, this is not a well designed bottle. The clear cover that you use to cover the straw/top and release with the one button doesn't go far back enough. (see picture). If you try to drink from the front it hits your head, if you try to drink from the side it hits your cheeks or ear area. Looking at mine it sure doesn't look that the clear cover goes back further so I'm not sure why I would want a bottle where the cap cover hits my face. The rest of the bottle is fine but this design is a head scratcher, literally.",0
"Title: Not worth the money
Review: These are made from pretty thin tubing.  When you try to crank the bolts down to keep them from coming loose from the constant vibration, it'll cave in the tubing in the center.  DOES NOT WORK WITH THE BRANDS LISTED.  Holes don't line up and you'll have to redrill half the holes.  Holes are not square-punched to accept the carriage bolts that you definitely have to use to put the pan back on.  You'd be better off going down to the steel shop and getting a heavier gauge tube and some round stock to use for handles.  39.95 for 10 bucks worth of steel doesn't seem like a bargain when you practically have to fabricate from scratch.  The only bolts I didn't have to fuss with were the ones to bolt the wheel guard back on.  Bought two sets, probab",0
"Title: Difficulty with the install!
Review: Picked this up based on reviews and concerns about the glass protectors having fit issues in the switch dock. My mistake.<br /><br />Let me start this out by saying I’m a capable individual who has never had an issue applying a screen protector to anything before. I’m the guy people make apply these to their devices because I am fairly good at it. Am I the greatest screen protector applicator dude on the planet? No. But I was pretty certain I could handle this on my own.<br /><br />So it arrives, well packaged, all the requisite tools for the job are present, I knew the general process but I still watched the installation videos. Watched it twice to be sure before setting to work. Fast forward 20 minutes and I have pulled this thing off my ",0
"Title: Poorly Designed
Review: This product needs major improvement. I should have listened to the other reviews regarding how small the cup holder is (the portion placed into the vehicle’s built in cup holder). You can’t fit a normal or regular sized cup/beverage in it which means you can’t weigh down the cup holder. If you’re unable to weigh down the cup holder, anything that has substantial weight to it will not be able to be placed in the expandable portion of the cup holder or else it will fall out. I used the extra padding that came with the product to try and make it fit more snug, but that didn’t help. Don’t waste your time purchasing this, I would recommend a single cup holder adapter that has a larger opening and use that instead.",0
"Title: Doesnt hold true to the Final Fantasy Series...
Review: Ran around in game for 4 hours, and all that was accomplished were 4 or 5 battles, a few tries at fishing, and how to scrapbook with photos the game takes for you.<br /><br />Battles consisted of holding a single button on the controller, no selection of skills, and attempting to dodge an attack by hitting another button within the millisecond that the screen flashed a warning.<br /><br />4 characters, but 3 of them were essentially NPC's<br /><br />If you're considering buying, go rent it from Redbox for a night or two first... cuz if you're expecting anything like final fantasy games , that's not what you're gonna get",0
"Title: Glue smell
Review: The glue lets off an odor which I found out that the mice keeps away from it.  I saw a mice run into my sink cabinet by jumping into the little gaps used to open it from underneath.  I said I got you sucker, since I lined the entire area in front of the gap.  Opened it to find that it was gone.  The mice ran along the border and looks like it jumped over the traps.  I cut 4 traps to fill it from one end to the other, and still the mouse just avoids it, even with food on it.<br /><br />I grabbed a fresh one and the glue gave off a powerful odor.  It must be the reason why the mice stop going to places I've placed the traps.",0

Review: I just received one of these in the mail even though I did not order it  This has been happening to me a lot lately and apparently I’m not the only one ( Google “Amazon packages I didn’t order” to see what I’m talking about). Most of them have been with us a little trinkets. This one surprised me because it’s apparently more valuable.

"Title: 50mb footprint on phone's internal memory?
Review: This app will be acceptable for some, but not for most.  I suspect the game wouldn't run as well (or at all) from the SD card, and that's why there is no ability to move it there.  Those who love pool will probably start deleting other apps just to make room for this thing.  A great number of people, however, won't even bother downloading.  A non-critical app of 50+ mb really needs the ability to move to the SD if you want your app to have a fighting chance at popularity.  However, if you add the options for this app to wash my car, do the dishes, run my errands, and mow the lawn, I'll gladly reconsider the 50 mb issue.  Until then.... NOT!<br /><br />Oh, and I'm desperately trying to scrub off that last star it gets by default due to not h",0
"Title: Highly recommend! Excellent quality, size and attention to detail!
Review: I got this to complement a large custom made winter wreath to go on my front door, now that the Christmas wreath is retired until next year. I specifically wanted this one because I will be using it outdoors and it needs to be weather proof. Sign is 5.5 inches x 13.5 inches. Two heavy duty hooks on back or a 45 inch cotton string for one point hanging.<br /><br />I like that it's made in USA and the quality is visibly excellent. The black base color is deep and uniform. The white Welcome is 3D and probably glued on, but it's done so well, not one spec of glue shows!!! This is the kind of attention to detail that I appreciate. Looks washable as well. I like the two heavy duty hooks on the back, there's a 45 inch cotton string that came with ",1
"Title: The best, long established brand you can rely on
Review: I've seen so many positive reviews of garbage incense. I want to share with others that I've used this brand for over 20 years, and it has always been simply the best. Everyone I've ever known who uses incense agrees with me about this. The quality is consistent. The scents are well done and nicely balanced; effective without bowling you over. They burn neatly without releasing too much smoke or soot. I mean, you can't go wrong with this brand. I've tried many of their scents, and every one has been lovely.",1
"Title: Not Diffused....Clear and transparent thus it's not very visible
Review: If you are looking for diffused leds, these are definitely not the ones to get. It clearly says ""Assorted Diffused Kit"", but it's not. They are clear leds. When it's on, because it's clear rather than diffused, you can barely see the color. Very disappointed as the title says they are. The other thing is they are ALL clear so good luck picking the ""blue"" leds when they are all mixed up. Unless leave them in their compartments, the only way to know what color they are is to connect to a circuit. Definitely a product that's being returned for me. If you want bright visible led's from all different angles, you need DIFFUSED LEDS, not clear transparent ones like these.",0
"Title: Works well on my sun spots!
Review: I really like using this serum to help with my sun spots. Being older, and after many years of tanning, my sun spots are very noticeable. I never paid much attention to them before, but it seems like they really stand out now when I look in the mirror. I am very pleased with the way this vitamin C serum has made them fade and evened out my skin tone. It has also helped diminish my fine lines and wrinkles. My skin appears youthful again. I was glad to see that this serum also contained hyaluronic acid because I love the way it makes my face look so hydrated. This serum is thin and it goes on quickly and smoothly. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any kind of residue. It does not have any scent. I have sensitive skin and this serum did not",1
"Title: Really Fine Singer
Review: I've just been discovering Rosemary Squires, and this is a very strong one for her.  If popular in the UK, I think she just was born a little late, or would have<br />been an even bigger singing star in the pre-rock era.  As someone said, something of a 'British Doris Day,' with just a little British 'burr' in the voice which to me is<br />very appealing. And I think Doris or Peggy Lee fans--or even possibly Petula Clark fans-- like me will like RS too. A really bright, lovely style and nice phrasing. Just fine vocals of<br />mostly classic, excellent standards. This one admittedly a little expensive, but worth it if youlike that style of singing. I hope someday all of her earlier albums are made available, at least on download.",1
"Title: If you don't need to disassemble, then you might check-out the older model.
Review: This product offers a 6.5” retractable belt.  The belt is black, but other colors / styles are offered and sold separately.<br /><br />This is certainly a higher-quality stanchion than so many other’s I know.  This one does not lean, is super easy to assemble, durable, stands back up when tipped, and so on.<br /><br />Please Note:  This is the “updated” model of another, less expensive model you will find from the same company.  The older / less-expensive model link is below.  I think the main difference between the two is the fact that the newer model pole and base can be easily assembled and then disassembled quickly.  The older / less-expensive model can not be disassembled, once put together.  So if disassembly is something you need, th",1

Review: I thought I finally found the black leather looking tissue holder I had been searching for.  I loved it at first and was excited to put my tissue box in it and put it in our newly remodeled downstairs bathroom.  Imagine my surprise when the bottom did not close properly!  How is this possible???  Aren't all cubed tissue boxes the same??  Sent it back and purchased the Sumnacon Square Leather Tissue Box Cover in black.  I had previously purchased the gray cloth version of this and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />So buyer beware, does not fit properly!",0
"Title: Cheap and it shows
Review: May update after customer service contacts me but went on one long flight to Russia, and the handles completely broke off the large bag and the medium and large bag cracked open on the bottom. Bags were not overfilled and within 50 pound airline limit . On the return flight, the mediums bag zipped broke and busted open losing contents and cracked some more. The large bag dented in and the small carry on bag handle stopped extending all the way. I would suggest buying sturdier bags with better reviews because it made the return trip a nightmare when we picked up our baggage. Now mind you, most of the damage occurred during the FIRST trip. That's not ok. I understand bags wearing down over time but come on.",0
"Title: Bad game with a good one attached.
Review: If you are looking for a good boots-on-the-ground game, You will have to go elsewhere. Bad knockoff of Advanced Warfare. Unequal gun powers or over powered guns. Pistols that shoot as well as rifles, ETC. More jumping around than shooting. THIS IS NOT CALL OF DUTY.  Call of duty is Modern Warfare. Which is why I purchased this game. Modern Warfare is a great game. Unfortunately you can't buy it separately. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  NOT WORTH $80. And you CAN NOT get your money back if you don't like it. Wait for a used copy if you must have it. I've played all the Call of Duty Series. INFINATE WARFARE IS THE VERY WORST OF THEM ALL!!!  GOOD LUCK!!!!",0

"Title: Biggest disappointment since Jar Jar Binks
Review: Like most parents I enjoy Saturday morning cartoons with my kid. It's fun to watch them discover Warner Brothers Looney Tunes and Superheroes for the first time. On the 'Amazing SpiderMan and Friends' show she really got into great characters like Iron Man, The Thing, The Red Skull, Venom, and of course, The Incredible Hulk. Imagine her excitement (she's 5) when she learned that the Hulk was going to be made into a movie!<br />I took her to the theater and I was looking forward to it myself. I was more of an X-Men and Iron Man type of guy myself, but I grew up watching the Incredible Hulk show on Friday night (it came on right after Sha na na).<br />Half an hour into the movie, she starts fidgeting, by the first hour she was asleep.

"Title: Practical, functional, and amazing!
Review: When searching for a high chair cover I came across this at my local store. I particularly wanted a high chair only cover not a universal one since my daughter is always in her stroller when at the store. I assumed this would be difficult to use and convert to a high chair cover, and boy was I wrong! This is the BEST cover. It easily sits on a high chair with no fuss, with 3 children it is difficult with a toddler and a 10 month old trying to get everyone situated at a restaurant especially with one hand! I can easily put this in her chair one handed, and get her in and out quickly if needed.<br /><br />As for the shopping cart cover part, I never thought I would use it and once again I was wrong! She loves riding in the cart when my toddle",1
"Title: Complete Frustration.
Review: I bought the Cricut Maker after reading a review on Wirecutter.com. I really wanted to love this machine. Unfortunately, it's not working out and hence I'm going to return it. For one thing, I prefer a non-Internet-based application. The Cricut stopped in the middle of a project cut and the error message indicated a faulty Internet. Mostly though, I'm returning the product because of the inaccurate cuts. I bought this for the purpose of cutting kiss-cut stickers and the alignment was off for half the page of stickers. It didn't matter how much I adjusted the cut image, every cut project resulted in inaccurate cuts and wasted material.",0
"Title: great heavy duty switch
Review: This is a heavy duty switch that's rated at 75A.  That's more than enough for my combination main/battery/alternator/ignition switch on my vehicle.  I used this and a second momentary push-button starter switch to replace the worn-out ignition lock switch on my Land Rover.  To be sure, both switches operate circuits with solenoids or relays so not all the vehicle's electrical load is going through this switch.  Now I can use my left hand fingers to pull ignition on, and hit the starter button with the thumb, and the right hand is free to shift gears or steer.<br /><br />I chose this switch versus a toggle switch because it was heavier duty than the best AN type toggle switches, and it has very positive action without needing an aircraft-sty",1

Review: [[VIDEOID:788b065757718cfbc594062e253194c6]] My initial impression of this car cover is a positive one. I think you get a good product for the price.<br /><br />The car cover wraps nicely around the car, has cutouts for the side view mirrors and an elastic band that runs around the edges of the cover with the addition of buckles for added protection from the wind. Also comes with a lock and wire to keep your cover safe!<br /><br />The zippered door is a nice touch if you forgot something in the car and need to quickly get in without taking the whole thing off.<br /><br />The inside layer is lined with cotton to help from scratching your car but I can already see small pieces shedding onto the car and it’s only been day 1.<br />I’m sure it’l",1

Review: Working through my reread of this series and I’m remembering how much I liked these books, but also the different smaller elements that made me love some of these books. I think the thing that set this book apart from the first three was that this book was way more angst ridden than the others.<br />Darian is our hero, our stoic fae who is apparently fading, he’s losing his light, which for a fae is a huge deal, like turn feral, huge deal. So of course when his mate shows up, Darian isn’t interested; all he wants is to protect the people he loves from whatever destruction comes at the end of his journey. It’s really very sad. All the other guys in the book have a much brighter outlook, whereas Darian just has no hope, and it changes the ton",1

I was able to do it by myself with no problems.  A hex screwdriver and a wrench are included.  Nothing else is needed because the poles just snap together.<br />I like that it comes with holding stakes to make it a little more secure if it's windy.

Review: In the design in the stock photo posted on the item page, the ring is set with emerald green and sapphire blue polished stones. The actual item I received was a hideous imitation which used enamel instead. The enamel work was not even very well done: for example, as you can see in the photos I've posted, some of the enamel dribbled outside the setting. Also contrary to the description, this ring is not sterling silver.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed, as I have been trying to find the actual ring pictured on this item page forever, and nobody seems to have it — only poor copies like this one.",0

The first one wore out over time, the second one was working fine for about a year until the little hand decided to swing around all the time. Based on our previous purchases I made sure to read all the reviews and this one got a lot of positive reviews and it looked really nice online.

Review: This is my second bottle and I am completely happy with the results. I have a '93 Toyota Tercel that only gets occasional use on the interstate but needs to be ready to go 80+mph. I had sluggish pickup and somewhat lower mileage until running a 12 gal. tank of gas (with about 6 oz of SI-1) through on a trip out of state. And I continued to add a couple of ounces or less to half a tank refills. Results were fast and effective. I had better pickup and the injectors were clearly cleaner. Mileage increased. No figures but any improvement at $4 a gallon is worthwhile. Highly recommend. You will save most of the cost in gas before you use all 15oz.",1

Review: This is all plastic except for the spinner. The plastic in the washing bin gets grimy really fast. I have to wash the side of the washing bin every 2-3 uses. When you drain the washing water from the bin, the grime floats on top and settles on your clothes. The spinner gets unbalanced very easily and makes a noisy clunking sound. I found out too late that the spinning basket was slamming into the sides of the machine and that the friction burned a hole into the washing portion.<br /><br />I strongly recommend you spend a little more and get a portable washer that had the spinner and the washing section together (ie not two separate compartments).",0

He has always put his keys on a carabiner, so this looked like the perfect thing to streamline his key situation.  He was intrigued and excited when I gave it to him and immediately put his keys on it.  It works like a charm.<br /><br />My only critiques are (and these haven't been issues for either of us yet!):<br />1. The screws on the non-carabiner side poke out some and could catch more delicate fabric or loose threads (or just poke you).

This is soft leather! It is comfortable to wear. It conforms to your body. You might even think that you forgot to put it on.

Review: And to think I was afraid to start this series since I was (wrongly) thinking that due to its more serious covers, that it would be one of those scary thrillers that I'm not a fan of, but that couldn't be further from the truth. It just moves at a little quicker pace than the cozies I've come to love from this author, the murder scenes while not seriously graphic are a little more defined but still not gross or anything, and some things are just a little more serious, but that's all good.<br /><br />I've come to really like these characters too!

My Dad always used to by discounted tape from terrible discount places and it would always be the type where everything melted together over the years.  in contrast, I would definitely call these rolls ""fresh"".  So much so that I'm not even sure I recognize them as masking tape.  Very good for temp holding power without leftover residue, labeling in a pinch, stuff like that.  They're not very wide, so these aren't the rolls you want to use as painter's tape (not very thick, either) or to span wide widths over long lengths.  But seems like very good tape.

After letting it sit for a bit it makes perfectly seasoned salsa. The next time I tried adding avocado to it, to see how it would be for a guacamole type of salsa. Oh my goodness! Fantastic.<br />So now the real test. How would it be using this with a simple can of petite diced tomatoes, and nothing else?

"Title: Shave like a champ!
Review: Love this old school safety razor. All the hype we receive regarding the latest “ONE MILLION BLADES TO LIFT, CHOP, MUTILATE, AND MOW DOWN EVEN THE TOUGHEST OF BEARDS” is just that. Hype.<br /><br />Shave like a real champ. Only a real champ that doesn’t need a straight razor. That’s the only way shaving could get cooler than using this razor. Slapping a straight razor on that strop of leather right before you commit to an arterial bleed! MANLY, BROTHER! Let me tell ya.<br /><br />But being civilized as I am, and living in a pretty good neighborhood, I figure I didn’t need the straight razor so I went with this beaut... glad I did.<br /><br />Built like a truck and twice as ugly, but I shave with a damned fine razor now.",1
"Title: Poor Quality
Review: Shredder Power light didn't light up when plugged in.  Instructions said there was an On/Off switch on back of shredder.  There wasn't.<br />Parts were difficult to assemble.  The motor part and waste basket kept sticking on one side of the frame.<br />After I took apart and reassembled, the power light came on.  I shredded a small piece of paper.  Unplugged and moved across the room and plugged in.  Again, the power light didn't come on, therefore, the shredder didn't work.  I decided at that point it was being returned.  I now had difficulty disassembling the parts due to them sticking to the frame.  Very poor quality in my opinion.",0
"Title: Don’t You Do It !!!
Review: I have purchased many foam toppers in the past and this by far was the worst. It did not measure 3 inches and it was extremely firm and uncomfortable to sleep on. If it was not a hassle to return I would have definitely returned this item. The cover on it is NOT water proof. It’s just something to cover it up. I should have just gone over to overstock where I originally buy these things from. I only replaced mine because I have a 3 year old that sleeps with us and that can be havoc over the years to your mattress.",0
"Title: helps me sleep
Review: This brand is working.  I take 2-4 capsules. 2 caps is the dose. If you are new to magnesium supplementation, start with a half dose and work your way up. I take this once I get in bed (sometimes also used along side another sleep supplement), and I am drifting off within 30 minutes, and am readily asleep almost as soon as I close my eyes.<br /><br />I've noticed that when it comes to magnesium, it is best to try different chelates to find the one (or ones) that work best for your needs. Some are energizing, some are relaxing, some promote sleep, and so on, and not the same thing happens to everyone. Then when it comes to dosing, the amount can vary greatly too. And, just because one is considered more bioavailable, and some are more diffic",1
"Title: Not great
Review: First off, despite being blender bottle brand, this does not come with a blender ball. I see that the description has been updated to reflect that, but when I placed my order shortly after release, I didn’t see anything in the description about a lack of blender ball.<br /><br />The bottle leaks from under the threads on a regular basis, just a drip or two each time it’s tilted, but enough.<br /><br />I had hoped to use this for double protein shakes (they mix better with extra room) and intra workout EAA powders, but it’s clearly not designed to be a “blender bottle”, just a reusable water bottle, and there are far superior ones on Amazon for the same price.",0
"Title: Lots of fun
Review: The kids loves this bounce house. It came out of the box and went up so easily. We just plugged it in. It isn't that big at all when it is not blown up. The kids loved it.<br /><br />We really like things to keep the kids active. I would much prefer them doing something than watching something. It is great because it is like a game for them but then they are being physically active.<br /><br />The quality was good. It worked as it was supposed to. It wasn’t too hard to set up.<br /><br />This is a great activity for a day when you don’t know what else to do or you want your child to burn off some energy. It is a good way to keep a child busy.<br /><br />The children really liked it.",1
"Title: Large and expensive
Review: Way too big.  I wish I had read the reviews before  I bought them. They apparently only fit a very specific brand of 12 cup coffee maker. In my coffee maker (which is a 12 cup) the filter falls over and coffee grounds get into the pot every time.  Also, I couldn’t really see any difference between these filters and my regular ones, so I’m a little skeptical of the biodegradable aspect. Anyway, I could get five 200 count filters at my local market for the total price I paid for these. Live and learn.",0
"Title: Nice quality trimmers
Review: I have issues with my husband always taking my nail clippers.  I was please to see this set of 4 Cartoon nail clippers,  They are normal small trimmers that have an outer case to them.  This outer case makes for better control of the trimmers.  They also came with a plastic sheath that covers the sharp end of the trimmers for protection.  They are in colors that I think my husband will resist taking.  They are a nice quality.  They are very sharp and cut very cleanly.  I have purchased others in the past that have not done a good job cutting and leave very rough edges to my nails.  They came in a set of 4 so I put one in the car and one in my purse.  The other 2 are stored in my bathroom for future use.",1
"Title: Incredibly boring, inert tale that ends up nowhere
Review: If you're looking for a fantastic story about a lost civilization, this isn't it.  Don't let the title fool you.  This is the story of a British explorer that claimed to have found a lost city in the Amazon... only we never see it.  The title is misleading, because the film is really just a biopic of Percy Fawcett.  There are a lot of pointless, disconnected scenes in this movie that hold little interest, and seem to be included by director James Gray simply because they were in the book.  Even the scenes in the jungle seem to be a random collection of shots strung together more than a cohesive series of events that follow a definite timeline.  The pace is incredibly lethargic, and Hunnam brings none of the charisma to this character that h",0
"Title: CHER AT HER WORST
Review: CHER AT HER WORST<br />Let me begin by pointing out that I love Cher. I think she is one of the greatest entertainers of our time. I grew up with her music and started collecting her albums with her very first solo album. I was one of the few who ran to the theater to see ""Chastity,"" her first dramatic film, when it was originally released. She richly deserved the Oscar for ""Moonstruck."" And, with a career that has spanned an astonishing 47 years, she has earned that worn-out sobriquet, ""living legend.""<br /><br />Like most artists who have enjoyed such lengthy careers--everyone from Joan Crawford to Madonna--she has reinvented herself numerous times, changing styles to keep up with the times. Unfortunately, this album documents the nadir o",0
"Title: Basic alarm with convenience features; two mounting options provided; includes 9v batteries
Review: No complaints about this set of 2 smoke alarms. They are basic, but have all the usual convenience features such as blinking the LED every 30 seconds to indicate proper functionality; a silence button; and a chirp when the battery gets low.<br /><br />I like that it uses 9v batteries rather than the built-in ones. While the ones with built-in batteries claim to have a 10 year life span, I've yet to get more than 5 years out of them before the non-replaceable battery dies and you have to toss the unit.  Granted, a replaceable battery design requires you to pay attention and replace the battery when needed, but I'm fine with that.<br /><br />Operation seems to be just fine based on my testing it with some smoke.<br /><br />It comes with 2 mou",1
"Title: Dont do it! Most disappointing ever.
Review: I usually buy Gustafs strawberry rope licorice , but this was cheaper.. now I  know why.<br /> I was so hopeful after reading reviews of this strawberry licorice! Oh! The disappointment! An ""almost edible"" disaster. Apparently they do not have ANY sort of quality control and clearly do not give one tiny poo about their reviews because the few negative reviwere right. But alas. I must expound on my dismay of this product and poo is a great place to start.<br />It tastes like a combination of artificial strawberry (not that there is anything wrong with that) artificial strawberry mixed with 90% alcohol hand sanitizer.  Most of it does. There where a few, very few, pieces I was able to pry off of the 2lb glob of stiff-stuck-together ""licorice""",0
"Title: This is my second Straightener Brush ever
Review: However, as far as products go... I really love everything about the way this company presents itself, it's design, it's product and how well the product performs. It has a great warranty (my last one from a different company died in less than 5 months with no recourse), and it came with a bunch of great stuff, including this weird little paddle (the green & white thing) I couldn't figure out at first was a cleaning utensil, and now I really love. It helps you pull the hair from the brush.<br /><br />At almost 30 years old this year, I had spent most of my life hating my hair with a passion.

"Title: Really Simple... Do Not Buy
Review: Absolutely misleading ""fact"" sheet. This unit was NOT particularly easy to set up. Don't expect good English in the instructions... be forgiving and imaginative. Bottom line... the SPEED is no where NEAR what they claim. The fastest I was able to achieve was 87 Mbs. 10 TIMES slower than their claim. So, if you want a so-so product that can't come close to the popular 150-300 Mbs provider speeds seen today, go ahead and waste your money! I strongly recommend paying 15-40 dollars more for a wifi router that will WORK. Read impartial reviews, and go from that. The extra money now will pay for itself with better performance and fewer headaches.",0
"Title: Great for toddlers
Review: Perfect for toddler transitioning from sippie cup with handles to a regular cup. The design of the straw ensures toddler cannot pull it out of the cup and is wide enough to allow for easy and thorough cleaning. Also, the straw is long enough to touch the bottom of the cup so frustrated toddler sucking on air. 👍🏻<br />The lid is tightly threaded so even if the cup is on it’s side it does not leak - we fill this and take it with us in the carriage, car and to restaurants without any leaks, ever. The colors are fun but still transparent so you can easily see the level of the liquid.<br />In our case, the cup has been dropped more times than I care to remember. Super, super resillant - no cracks or damage of any kind.<br />Bought a 2nd set for ",1

"Title: Easy to use
Review: This height gauge comes with two different Kaydee couplers with replacement springs. There are two kinds of height gauges made by Kadee, a metal one and a plastic one. I purchased the plastic one. It is well made and sturdy. The advantage to a plastic one is that it is insulated but a little lighter than the metal one. It not only checks coupler height, it doubles as a track gauge. You could also use it to check the distance between wheel flanges. A helpful tool to keep your engines and rolling stock moving smoothly with less annoying uncoupling. Would purchase again.",1
"Title: Rubber is bad---They Fall Apart
Review: I really liked the fast shipping and it all fit perfectly. I use this dryer very little so it has taken about a year for them to fail.  Maybe like 3 months of normal use? But when they failed, they slung rubber (if that's what it is?) all over. I put new pads on the front and a new belt at the same time I replaced these, and the other parts look new.  These look new with big chunks of rubber gone. So I really do not think these are worth your time to install.  JUNK---NO GOOD--DON'T BUY!!!  They may be evil?  It will waist part of your life to reinstall the replacements you WILL have to buy!",0
"Title: Really tiny cookies not worth the money!
Review: I thought these sounded so delicious, and when they were offered on sale, I had to buy them. I am very disappointed. The box is small, and each of the little tiny packages only holds 4 tiny cookies (about one inch in size). Even on sale, they are totally not worth it. There's nothing magical about the flavor. They taste like most of the coconut cookies I've ever tried. There are a lot better ones on the market. These are not thrilling in the least, despite the name that conjures up images of a tropical paradise. I do not recommend them for the money (think I paid just over $7) and would never buy these again.",0

This downloaded fine over my wi-fi and loaded the first time (and each subsequent time on my VM Optimus V (a pretty low end device).<br /><br />The game play is just as good as my iphone, although it loads much faster on my Android.

"Title: DO NOT BUY
Review: I cannot tell you what to do. Because I read all the reviews and I bought it anyway! I thought it cannot really be that bad. I WAS WRONG. The suction is really really bad. I let it sit on a piece of lint for approximately 2-3 minutes. It did not suction the lint up. I actually picked the lint up to see if it was stuck to the item. It was not stuck. I put the suction on my face, it was just air, not suctioning any thing. I tried to suction up some dust, the dust just stayed where it was. This is totally useless. I do not know how the company can sell this as a vacuum. I held a piece of debris  up to the nozzle and it did suction that up. But if I have to pick up everything and hold it up to the nozzle, that kind of defeats the purpose, don't",0
"Title: Use a better material for gift cards or package it better...
Review: I received an Amazon gift card as a gift from the company I worked for. It was purchased as this so the initial packaging was done by Amazon. The sticky tac in the envelope was placed right on top of the peel off strip so when I attempted to take it out of the envelope it ripped the strip off the card and caused a surface tear on the card rendering the claim code completely unreadable. Called support only to find that because the code is completely gone there is no other way to redeem this except to contact the individuals who purchased the gift card in the first place to contact Amazon. This is the only company I have seen that uses such a cheap material for their gift cards that this can possibly be a problem. All other companies use actu",0
"Title: I changed the straps
Review: UPDATE (12/23/20):  I wore this mask on the plane (mandatory) flying from east to west and vice versa.  It was comfortable enough for me to sleep through the flight.  Before throwing one out, I cut the mask and found 4 layers inside as advertised.  I did end up using a separate metal nose strip for better fit, but all in all, this mask is our family favorite.<br /><br />This mask is for over the ears.  I prefer over the head, so I cut the straps off and attached new elastic straps.  Easy fix.  This mask is one of the most comfortable mask I have ever bought.  It is very thin, so I was bit suspicious that it’s not 4-layered as advertised.  Luckily, other reviewers have already dissected one to check – and indeed there were 4 layers.<br /><br",1
"Title: Mega Fail Do Not Purchase
Review: I used precision foam 8N and my blonde went orange/brassy. I didn't think it was that bad until my husband noticed (rare). So I used this gloss, which claims to &#34;neutralize brassiness&#34;, and my hair went more orange. Not only was it hard to work through the hair, but it feels even more damaged than before (despite product claims &#34;will not damage hair&#34;), and it took forever to rinse out. I couldn't even tell if I had it all out because it just left my hair feeling like an abrasive scrubbing pad.  There are much better gloss/toners you can purchase than this one; either way, use something that is NOT THIS, or just don't use anything at all. So disappointed... now my hair is so damaged I don't think I can have the color fixed.",0

Great feel and protection, plus I have two spares.<br />For what I paid for 'another' brand at the cell carrier store (not hard to figure out since the S7 Active is only available from one carrier) I can go through more than a dozen of these protectors.

This swing however does not work for that the seat is super shallow and because it’s 5 point harness there is no “im going to place my sleeping baby who’s wrap in her blanket in her swing” the directions are super confusing because it’s just picture no words nothing on and the box is super miss leading because it doesn’t tell you that you will also need 1 random c battery for the seat piece till you get home and are in the middle of trying to put the stupid thing together but on the plus side it does fold flat so when your baby won’t sit in it you can store it in the closet for ever",0

Review: The battery  life is roughly 2 hours. I work outside for 10 hour shifts and have ample opportunity to charge them as needed, but... for that 2 hours of some warming, it takes more than 6 hours to charge and charging them has overheated 2 of my good charging ports.

"Title: Wise Insight Into How to Obey the Ten Commandments
Review: Jen Wilkin has a talent for explaining ancient commandments in the Bible in everyday language. The Ten Commandments look simple on the surface, but it is easy to break them without actually meaning to. A lot of people use God's name in vain when they swear and worship other gods by giving worldly things a higher priority than God. And coveting other people's possessions and lives is a national sport.<br /><br />Jen Wilkin explains all the background before The Ten Commandments were given. Then she delves into commentary chapter by chapter, one commandment at a time. For anyone seeking to understand the full dimensions of each commandment, this is truly edifying and educational.<br /><br />Some of the questions this book answers include:<br ",1

Review: Last one in this series I will read. I used to love this series but obviously by book 16 Ms. Barrett has run out of ideas so she introduces (last book) an obnoxious character in Becca, the former tennis star and has Tricia blab about things that she should know better than to share. While this moves the story along it just becomes very unbelievable that anyone would tell all they know to anyone who will listen. Plus we learn ""Spoiler Alert"" that Pixie has a son she gave up at birth which Tricia feels the need to share with her rather than let the child tell her.  No one has ever used that line before. Very disappointed in the book. This is last I will read in this series, sometimes if you have run out of story lines it is better to let the ",0

"Title: Terrible! Do Not Buy!
Review: These reeds are terrible. I have never felt compelled to write a review for something that was such low quality, but these take the cake. When I opened the box, the reeds were packed in tightly into small cardboard &#34;cases&#34;. They all had a residue on them which I assumed was sawdust or dust from the cardboard. Half of the reeds were cracked or damaged, and nearly all of them need sanding. Some of the reeds were made using the dead parts of the reed and are discolored. I was in a bind and really needed cheap reeds, but these are not worth it. Next time, I'll spend a little more for QUALITY rather than QUANTITY. I would demand a refund, but I half expected them to be terrible, so I guess I got what I deserved.<br />I attached a photo o",0

Up to this point I have not found an adapter that works with every devices I have tried - sometimes I can charge cell phones, sometimes music players, but for some reason it seems to be a challenge to charge everything. Belkin has put together an adapter that finally manages to work with everything I have tried.<br /><br />This particular adapter is a little bit different than most others I have seen.

The steam escapes badly from each end of the hose. Not where the female connector screws to the steamer but where the tube goes into the connector. I cannot believe this was made for steam.

"Title: This is a great soundtrack. Frank the movie was loosely based off ...
Review: This is a great soundtrack. Frank the movie was loosely based off of the character of Frank Sidebottom who was portrayed by Chris Sievey for over 30 years until his death in 2010. The film was written by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan, and was based on Ronson's experiences playing in Sievey's Oh Blimey Big Band. Although drawing from Ronson's memoir, the movie is set in modern times and the character of Frank also drew upon other famous eccentric musicians. The music in this soundtrack is fun and interesting. Played by Michael Fassbender of X-Men fame as Magneto, Frank is an eccentric musical genuine with delusions of grandeur. Frank really is a lovable character. Both on film and in real life.<br /><br />This vinyl soundtrack sounds great.",1

Review: I own this and a Worldmax Black Dawg and they are nearly identical. I'll outline the differences below. Regardless of pedigree this is an excellent snare drum that is a little more cutting than a [[ASIN:B00502CB78 Ludwig LM400 Supraphonic]] and beautiful tonality that only a brass shell can deliver.<br /><br />Here are the similarities between this and the Dawg: both have a brass shell with a welded seam in the same spot, both have the S9X strainer (by Worldmax) and the tube lugs appear to be plated Worldmax TU100s. Note that the hole spacing for the strainer is different from the main line of Ludwig snare drums, which means that you cannot upgrade it to a P86.<br /><br />The differences are in the finish, which is a beautifully done black ",1

I decided to try this mask set in hopes that my skin might feel refreshed and moisturized before it’s even dryer in the winter months.

"Title: Innovative on a number of levels
Review: There are some excellent reviews going back to 2000 that cover this album exhaustively. My perspective is the format that Rollins came up with and used for the first time on one of his recordings: pianoless trios that used a bassist and drummer to back Rollins. This is the first of his albums to employ that format and it was a pretty daring move back in 1957.<br /><br />Before I get too far off track give the sound samples on this page a listen. Some reviews have complained about the mix, but I suspect that this is exactly how Rollins intended the album to sound, but 1957 recording technology was not up to it. At any rate, the mix brings to the fore Ray Brown's bass, which has an unmistakable tone and style to begin with. What captivated me",1
"Title: Delicate but Beatiful
Review: I was pleasantly surprised by these earrings - as someone with super-sensitive ears, I've basically given up wearing any earrings that don't cost a ton of money (i.e...none at all). However, when I saw that these were gold-plated I decided to give them a try. I've now been wearing them for several hours and still no pain or irritation, so that's a major win in my book.<br /><br />As for the aesthetics, I would describe the earrings as delicate, whimsical, and feminine. They are also dainty and lightweight - which I love as heavy earrings can also be difficult for sensitive ears. However, the tradeoff will be that they could be very easy to bend out of shape, so that's just something to consider for storing/handling.",1

It is NOTHING like it use to be and we are finished buying it.<br /><br />This stuff shreds as it's being used. It's so thin, it's ridiculous. I won't go into gross descriptions and explanations - I'll just let that suffice. This was never the softest TP you could buy, buy the rolls were huge, lasted a long time and the paper worked without having to use half a roll.<br /><br />I really hate it when companies change things that don't need to be changed. When you have a successful product, why not just leave it that way? You've lost this 30+ year user.",0
"Title: Perfect set that comes with a great storage box
Review: This is a great set of essential oils. You average about $4 per oil which is a great price. In addition to these great oils that come in a very nice card board box for themselves, you also get a very nice wooden storage box that you can store additional oils in. I am keeping the oils in the little box they come in because it is a very nice storage box already and am storing other oils I have in the wooden box. That wooden box is very nice and comes with a little hinge so you can securely close it.<br /><br />In this set you get lavender, peppermint, eucalyptus, lemongrass, orange and cedarwood. Besides eucalyptus I love all of them and I am just not a huge fan of that fragrance that is all. They are all high quality oils that I use in an oi",1
"Title: These are the perfect capris, seriously. EDIT: not anymore.
Review: EDIT: purchased another pair a year later. Either they are now knock offs or they changed the fabric and didn’t change the item description. They are NOT 87%nylon/13% spandex as the old ones were and the description states. They are 88/12 and this makes a WORLD of difference. They are NOT squat proof. Itchy, not breathable, shiny, and generally don’t feel nice to wear. I’m pretty annoyed to say the least.<br /><br />These are the perfect capris, seriously. If you want them to be more &#34;tummy trimming&#34; order a size down.  The size you would generally wear will be comfortable, but not have the slimming.  I have purchased four pairs in two weeks, because I love them!  *edit*  I still love them...however; I find the do tend to dig at the",0

Review: At first this screen protector was not the most case friendly. However they issued replacements and please take my word for it, they are now 100% case friendly. I have 10 cases, brands like Spigen, caseology, samsung's alcantara, ghostek, Incipio etc. And it now fits perfectly with this screen protector.<br /><br />Do not listen to the old reviews, they updated it and they have absolutely incredible customer service. Thank you for updating your screen protectors, issuing the replacements & responding to my emails. My go-to always. Recommended 1,000% you will not be disappointed.",1
"Title: Plants arrived healthy-Phoenix Arizona
Review: The plants are really small, but they arrived in great shape with the 100+ degree weather we have here in Phoenix. I opened and watered in the sink and let drain, I follow the directions for watering and the plant is growing and looking really good. I got the first plant in mid May and let it acclimate until the next plant came and then I transplanted into a bigger planter and it's doing great. The second plant came mid June and was in just as good shape. I really like the cards that come with them that tell you what you have and how to care for it. So far, so good after two deliveries-again in severe heat-and the plants have been pretty and healthy.",1
"Title: The Fascinating World of Olive Oil Exposed
Review: When it comes to food, we normally take for granted that what is contained in the package we buy is the same, or close to, the food as it has been described. Most can accept a few slight altercations, but one item that is often not what it should be is olive oil. The problems with this food form the main subject in this book, Extra Virginity.<br /><br />Olive oil isn’t the type of food most of us give much thought to and that is mainly because, at least here in the United States, it isn’t a popular food. American consumption of olive oil is quite low when compared to other countries. Most of us use it sparingly, and thus we give little thought to the liquid contained inside that tall, skinny bottle we usually find in the baking section of m",1
"Title: Waste of money for suckers
Review: I bought this item at a brick and mortar retailer with a giraffe as a mascot a while back before they were popular, my 3 year old loves surprise eggs so I thought what the heck.  This must cost about $3 to make.  The dolls are small, about the size of a palm, and the rest of the surprises are just cheap garbage, unfortunately people go to great lengths to get the hot new thing, I don't how this made that list, at least Hatchimals last year were innovative and well made, these cost more and are not worth it, don't fall victim to hype don't waste your money on inflated markups!",0

Review: I was using these for diaper changes for my baby, I noticed some redness and just thiught it was some diaper rash starting. Then I used 2 wipes to wipe her face after she ate and instantly her face started to go red. I figured it was just her sensitive skin and the wipes weren't a good choice for her. So I figured I would finish them off using them for make up removal. My face was fine at first then after a few more wipes to finish off my make up removal my face started to burn and turn red. They burned my skin! I dont have sensitive skin. These wipes are not for sensitive skin let alone anyone's skin. Becareful using these!",0
"Title: Fantastic silicone oven mits
Review: Loves these mits! I’ve never had/used silicone oven mits before so I was a little skeptical of how well they would work but now I don’t think I’ll ever go back to the old cloth ones!<br /><br />These disperse the heat from all of my bakeware perfectly, I don’t feel any of it. There was no melting or charring of the mits, even when I had to adjust the rack in the preheated oven. The little loop on the ends is a nice touch and fits over our drawer knob perfectly for easy access right next to the oven.<br /><br />The color on these is a true teal/blue green and fits in to our beachy decor nicely. Highly recommend!",1
"Title: An Essential Microneedling Tool! 🔗
Review: I am really impressed by this little contraption, especially since not all derma rollers are created equal! For beginner users, I think the roller width and needle diameter are ideally sized on this one, and only minimal redness should result. It does help to pull the skin taut and adjust downward pressure accordingly (since skin elasticity and sensitivity will vary from person to person). I love that a hard plastic containment case is included with this product, as it helps to guarantee clean storage between uses. It’s important to remember the hygiene preparation step before each use, since sanitation with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide ensures a microbial-free experience each time, but overall, I’m very satisfied with the results t",1
"Title: Love it!
Review: Few things to mention. Overall, works perfect! Though there is no Nissan symbol that is the least of my worries. The shipping came super fast days before it said it would so that's always a plus. I programmed the remote the same day and works like a charm. I programmed the remote along side with a different style remote and didn't have any problems getting them both to work. Though the distance to set the alarm is not as far as I expected, maybe 5-20ft while walking to my car but not a bothersome issue because overall it's doing what I bought it for!<br />Thanks!",1
"Title: Way better than the outdated builder grade brackets that came with the house
Review: [[VIDEOID:3edd72d53ee8eb013c38a09e7049daf0]] These heavy duty brackets compliment our homes styling and replaced the 90's style wooden brackets that always have bothered me. I was fairly concerned about the high cost of these but once they arrived they were well worth it. I searched and searched for a similar sized option at a lower price and there are none. They come painted in satin black and are thick gauge steel. The pictures don't show it but there are four mounting holes on inside of the bracket as well but would be difficult to use so I didn't use them as my purposes are mostly decorative. Shipping was surprisingly quick and I had them within 3 days of purchase. Great quality and I couldn't recommend them enough!",1
"Title: Too many keystrokes to listen to and delete messages
Review: We have a previous generation of this Panasonic phone, now after many years with buttons not working reliably.  It worked well, lasted a long time, but some handset operations required too many keystrokes (compared with our previous Uniden phone).  But you could listen to messages on the handset with one keystroke, and delete them with another.  The new one requires either navigating through their menu system or entering a code.  Either one requires 5-6 keystrokes.  They have taken a few steps backwards, probably to add their cell phone features.  Listening to and deleting messages from the base station is one key press for each.  Am returning this for another system.",0

Not sure how they can do that. At this time, the product is 3D lash mascara or something like that.

"Title: Sticky, gooey..... mess
Review: This bar, was nothing but a gooey mess that could NOT be eaten without needing a way to wash your hands.  It was completely stuck to the wrapper.  It had to be eaten by opening the wrapping, down the seam and then eating it OFF the wrapper.<br /><br />Oh, you could use your fingers to pull a piece off the wrapper, but be prepared to need a handy wipe or sink.<br /><br />Flavor not bad, but seriously overpriced for what you're given.  No hope of eating this in the car, or at your desk...<br /><br />If you like overpriced, sticky finger food, this is a good choice.",0
"Title: Effective sunscreen
Review: This is a great sunblock. My entire family used this during our family vacay in Cancun this past July, when the sun could not be more scorching, and no one got burned. It does leave a bit of that white cast regardless of how much you rub it in, but I think that is something you cannot escape with mineral sunscreens (unless they are tinted).  Before I purchased, I did read some reviews that indicated that this product smelled like chocolate.  I generally hate sweet/warm scents, as they make me nauseated, but to my surprise the chocolate smell is mild and not repulsive at all.",1
"Title: Amazing little scissors!
Review: I think I am officially hooked on BIHRTC scissors.  This is about the 6th pair of sewing scissors I have from this company, and I just love this pair with the very tiny blades.  And while tiny they may be, those blades are sharp!  Be careful with them!  They work perfectly and are a pretty pair of little scissors.  If you don't have a seam ripper, these scissors will do the trick if you need to open or remove a a seam or excess threads.  They aren't the most comfortable to hold due to their small size, but they get the job done and can get into tight places that other scissors can't.  Highly recommend!",1
"Title: By far one of the worst hair extensions on the market
Review: I bought this product as a comparison to another name brand tape in hair extension. They both were 16"" REMI human hair extensions of similar color. Out of the package it was quite clear that these extensions were damaged, over processed hair that felt equivalent to doll hair. The color was chunky highlights, even though the color was far more subtle online. But I wanted to be thorough in my assessment. So we added them at the nape of my neck where they would be less visible. Using them at all was a mistake. Within 2 days, one ripped out taking my hair with it. Within a week another one followed. I still have one remaining that constantly gets matted up, no matter what I do it it. The name brand extensions still look and feel fantastic.",0
"Title: Very disappointed!
Review: I have been buying Gingher left-handed shears for the last thirty years because of the consistent high quality and wonderful performance.  Alas, that is no longer the case.  The last pair I bought was two years ago, and I was very disappointed.  I had such a difficult time using them that I at first thought the package had mistakenly contained a pair of right-handed scissors.  But after comparing them to an older pair, I discovered that the problem actually lay in Gingher's new design and lighter weight.  Last month I tried to buy another pair, only to discover the same problem.  I have added a photograph of the old and new pairs side-by-side, above, in order to demonstrate how much lighter and cheaper they now are.  For those of us left-ha",0
"Title: It doesn't work (UPDATE)

I am going to return this and update my review if anything changes.<br /><br />UPDATE - new controller came today, has the exact same issues as the first. Researching the issue further it looks like this a VERY common issue that affects all series 2 controllers. Simply search ""Elite series 2 y button"".",0
"Title: Disappointing features and no compelling cost/value
Review: Despite the glossy and attractive color and design (more suited for a child's desk), the 'plasticky' feel, the tiny compartments, an OK sound quality, and the lack of charging station makes this a very poor value for the suggested list price.  There are some compelling value to be found in the clock/speaker/charger combos such as [[ASIN:B00387EBKC iLuv Vibe Plus Bed Shaker Dual Alarm Clock Dock for iPhone and iPod, (Black)]] but the options with lamps are fairly limited. iHome makes other products that combine a lamp and a charging station - but not having used them, unsure how good they are.

Review: ""Jeff's Wife"" - I bought this after using up the Luminess Air foundation that I got from Vine a few months ago. I knew that it wasn't going to be exactly like the Luminess Air and I also knew that, like the first time I tried airbrush make up, there would be a little trial & error in finding the right combination of shades.<br /><br />It is slightly thicker but comes out of the dropper just fine (unless a mixing ball gets too close to the dropper) and it doesn't feel cold when applying like LA.

Review: This Tom's of Maine Daily Moisture beauty bar is excellent to use all year long but I especially like to use it in the dry fall and winter weather. If you are used to using other soaps that dry out your skin you will especially appreciate this bar soap that has olive oil and vitamin E.

Review: In our house, there are two things we love to do for fun: play cards and watch movies. This edition of Uno pairs our love for Pixar animation with the classic card game for maximum fun! We love the new rule: name a Pixar movie and five characters from the film when you land on a wild card. It gives us just one more thing to be a little competitive over and keeps the dialogue going whenever we sit down to play. One of the things we love most is the tin that the game comes in. Unlike the cardboard box that the original game comes in, which takes a beating over time, this one should last for years. Also, the cards themselves are fun to look at because they each have a different Pixar character on them. Whether you're getting this game to play ",1

"Title: Nice set, but not exactly for beginners
Review: Unless you know you want to start with a heavier set, consider finding a lighter weight set in the 140g-160g range. Most beginners will be better served by a lighter weight set until they learn to throw. That was (is) certainly true for me.<br /><br />Excited to get started in disc golf, this 170g-ish set is the first set I purchased based on what I had read so far (and the value). After further reading, I also bought a lighter weight three-disc set from Latitude 64, and I'm glad I did. After a couple of months I'm barely starting to throw this heavier set reliably, yet I've bought more discs in the 150g-165g range to round out my ""throwable"" set. For now I'm doing best in that 150g-165g range, and the heavier fairway and distance drivers f",1

Review: I got my first DSLR a little over a year ago. A not so well cared for Canon Rebel T2i. At first I loved it.

The ""yard"" is of such a small gauge it should be categorized as thread.  I cast on three times, ripping back to the beginning each time.  Yes, I did drop a stitch, but it was impossible to recover.  Then I would count my stitches and lo and behold I was two over, then three.  Hmmm.  Turns out the thread was splitting.

Review: This brush states it &#34;cleans cement&#34; When it would not clean my &#34;smooth&#34; driveway the seller stated first you don't know how to use this and second it is made for smooth interior concrete.g. If you read the reviews regarding this product no where does it state it is to be used on interior smooth concrete. It states everything but.... Please don't buy this product for exterior use and please think twice in dealing with this seller. This is the first bad review I have ever written in the hundreds of products purchased from Amazon. The vibration was so bad that the young guy that was stripping the driveway could not steady it and the result was 3 bent blades.  Be aware that the company will NOT issue any refunds at all.  I gues",0
"Title: ONE STAR....POOR QUALITY!!
Review: Change that review to a One Star. This stuff is Bogus. When I received it, I thought it looked a little different than the sucanat I remembered but tried it anyways. I ended up buying another package of sucanat from another retailer, and THERE was the sucanat I remembered. I even poured the new stuff in the top of the Wincrest container to compare, and the smell, size, and color of the new product was clear; no comparison. Whatever Wincrest is selling, it is of poor quality. I'd buy from somewhere else for sure!",0
"Title: Very Disappointed
Review: I have loved the previous Warshawski novels, however, this one is a disappointment.  Vick is not the same sassy PI in this book, she seems to trudge along through the story as I felt I was doing.  I tried to stick with it even as I began to be irritated that it felt like I was being instructed in a heavy social/political agenda.  I finally just called it quits about 3/4 of the way through.  By that point, the story was lost in the issues.<br />I stay abreast of current events and read a lot about the social and political situation in the world today.  However, when I read for pleasure I am not looking to be instructed of someone else's political views.  I am finished with this series and this author.",0
"Title: Bad Diarrhea
Review: They tasted good and texture fine. Added it to vegetables and broth from a place I eat at often. Later had a bad case of diarrhea and thought about what ingredients were different that I ate. And this was the only different item.<br /><br />Decided to Google and found a good number of warnings about the lack of ability to digest this so called fiber.<br /><br />Worse yet, saw more than I'd like to see, reviews of severe pains, blockage in the stomach, and some rare cases requiring surgery to remove the blockage.<br /><br />I don't think I'll risk it even though so the benefits are so great, no calorie, no carbs, good for diabetics, etc.<br /><br />Bummer.",0
"Title: Covered in cat hair and holes...so much for new.
Review: So very disappointed.  I had purchased this for my friend's son for Halloween this year.  I thought I was purchasing a brand new costume, but when we opened the package at work, the costume was covered in cat and had several holes in the costume right out of the package.  This was such a disappointment because we were both excited to look at how cute this costume was and she wanted to see if it would be long enough to fit her son.  To add, I do not have any pets.  The cat hair was straight from the package.<br /><br />Who returns a USED, unclean costume?  Who does not inspect and sell same said costume?!<br />I ended up requesting a refund from Amazon.",0
"Title: PNP Switch or Gear Position Sensor
Review: I tried to replace the switch myself but one needs to be either smaller in girth than I or have a lift where you can get under the car, I ended up taking to a Volvo mechanic shop and they charged me $200 labor to install it.  Took the old one apart and found that there is not a seal where the position stub goes into switch and grease and dirt get inside switch.  After replacement all the flashing lights on the display went away.  Switch is a genuine Volvo part, it is OEM for the cost of what the dealer pays for it.  Very happy with the part, it solved my Volvo S90 transmission problem.",1
"Title: God awful
Review: The dancing is amazing but I saw this as a two part film each one lasting 90 mins - it does prove one thing though - extraordinary dancers cannot act for toffee!<br /><br />One thing really annoyed me and that the dance section set on the ship - ships are made with air tight sections and all the doors have locks - so why did the victims run around the engine room and when one did go into a room - he didnt lock the door....that's just stooped.<br /><br />Watch it if you love dance but avoid it if you love movies.",0
"Title: Consider this a Half Star Rating
Review: I have ordered many, many &#34;old&#34; coins from Liberty Coin.  I have been doing business with them for years.<br />Their coin shave always always been as advertised or even better than I could have hoped for.<br />Hence, the reason I have been such a loyal and frequent customer.<br />  I opened the shipping packaging (5 star level) and saw the OGP box/coin case (gorgeous, pristine 5 plus rating), with great anticipation I opened the coin case, only to find a coin that is unexpectedly, well, awful.<br />  Shiny, proof type quality contrast?

"Title: DO NOT BUY - CHEAP/POOR QUALITY
Review: Yeah DON'T buy this. Extremely cheap quality (I could see light reflecting through the lid) and very overpriced for what you get. The box gave me a large sliver when I took it out of the package and after further inspection I noticed it was hardly sanded and had chips on the lid. Hinges are flimsy and unevenly placed so the lid does not close properly. Absolutely terrible. I gave a real good sanding, painted, and added some decent hinges and a clasp to hold the lid shut so I might as well have just made a better one myself. BUYERS BEWARE unless you are looking for expensive fire kindling.",0
"Title: Quick, simple setup and great functionality
Review: The setup of the laptop stand was extremely quick and simple.  Pull the base out and expand, then attach the laptop platform.  It is that simple and includes a nice sticky pad to ensure whether the platform is level or angled, the laptop, iPad, or other device will surely stay put.  The extension shaft includes clamp to put at any desired height as well as stop pin to ensure the platform does not drop below the desired height.  Finally, the sturdiness is great with the wide tripod base which allows for typical typing and device use on the platform.",1
"Title: IF you need this, it’s great.
Review: Ok the thing with reviewing supplements is, like any medicine, reactions and needs are individual.  If you don’t have high cholesterol, and you take a statin, it’s not that statins are bad - it’s just not for you. I’d encourage other reviewers to add context to their reviews!<br /><br />My context is: with my doctor, we reviewed a bunch of symptoms and did some testing of my neurotransmitter and hormone levels over 24 hours. It was very apparent there was a problem with my cortisol cycles. They actually suggested I use a different supplement with similar ingredients that’s marketed 2 ways - as a cortisol manager and as a sleep aid (literally the same pills under 2 different sister brands and 2 labels). But that had soy which was problematic",1
"Title: A Bird’s-Eye View of Unconditional Love! 🪶
Review: When a little boy named Wade receives a surprise visit from a backyard bird, he is taken on an unforgettable flight through the skies above his town. He must first undergo a size adjustment, so as his stature shrinks, he becomes miniaturized enough to fit on the shoulders of the bird. The two seem to share a telepathic connection of calm understanding, and Wade’s fear of potentially falling quickly subsides. As he begins to absorb and interpret things from an aerial perspective, he uses his newfound “bird’s-eye view” to make some enlightened observations about different people and their displayed levels of happiness. Children and elementary schools seem to radiate rainbow-colored auras, while the adults, factories, and office buildings seem",1
"Title: Think Multiplication with this Multi-Cam Stream...
Review: This works wonders in most situations like church streaming, studio streaming, or sports.  Multiple camera hook ups.  Catch all the right angles.  Can run 4 k cameras only at 1080 which still works great for us.  Sometimes we use directed wired internet and sometimes wireless.  Easy switching during live broadcasts.  We have a guy who worked for our local TV station who uses this a lot for our services online.  We have encountered no issues with this device, and it has enhanced our streaming experience.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)",1
"Title: Barely heats up
Review: I like the size and the softness, however, this pad barely heats up. I do realize that it's suppose to provide a low level of heat for cats; however, I have another cat heating device made for igloos in hard plastic by another brand, and it gets much much warmer. I'm not sure if the pad I received is simply defective or not. I'm planning on sending it back, but still trying to decide if I want a replacement pad or just my money. I'm concerned that another one might be just as bad as the one I have in hand, and after all, it's some work packing things up and shipping them back. All I really know for sure is that this pad, even set at the highest temperature, can barely be felt. I purchased this on sale for about $25 for my semi feral outdoor",0
"Title: Converts nitrate back into ammonia
Review: It hardly reduced the nitrate and the little it did it turned it back into ammonia. I test the water weekly. The aquarium was testing fine. 6.8 ph ,0 ppm ammonia  ,0 ppm nitrite ,4.0 ppm nitrate. I should have knew better that’s not high for nitrates but wanted my fish to enjoy purer water. They receive a 35% waster change monthly and I was only 2 weeks in. Added 55 ml to half gallon of water that had already been treated and ready for my aquarium and poured into my filter system to be introduced slowly to the aquarium. The fish had already been fed. The next morning I found two of my dwarf rams dead. There was only six dwarf total in the 55 gallon tank. Fished them out and went to work. When I got home before feeding I tested the water aga",0

Review: After using this case for month, I like it.  It fit my Holton H179 (Farkas double horn) perfectly, and it's nice to have the side pocket to put my music folder and other odds and ends in.  I liked that it came with backback-style straps--that caught the attention of several fellow community band members, and the other french horn players remarked at how light the case was compared to their hard cases.<br />I probably wouldn't recommend this case for airline travel, but for a day-to-day case it's been great so far.  And a pretty good deal for the price!",1
"Title: Wrong color sent twice
Review: I am throwing a baby shower and decided to make the centerpieces myself. The color available on the website said blush pink which is perfect however the FIRST time I received the item it was pearl pink. Which isn’t the same color or even shows as a color option for the product. So they sent me a replacement item at no cost and it was also the wrong color!! I am very annoyed by this, especially since it is a good price and good quality but not what I need. They can at least change the color showing available so this doesn’t happen again to anyone expecting a certain color and getting another.",0

Review: I can describe how much I love this Nap Mat for my son and he absolutely loves it too.  This is my second school year buying their products and different themes.  It is completely worth the price.  I have washed his last year one so many times that he could even have used it again but I wanted to buy a new theme this year. It brings the pillow and it is so well sewed and the material is soft and durable.  You can take the pillow out and wash alone if you like.  The way it folds is so easy to carry and is light weight.  Excellent size to fit my big baby too.  Highly recommended and it is shipped very very fast.  Good job Olive Kids!!!",1
"Title: So Precious is Lavender and Lace
Review: This little girl's ballet leotard is so precious! It's lavender with lavender lace. Love it! The front is lavender spandex with about 2 inches of lace at the top with the narrow straps. The back is a big attraction with four cut-outs filled with the lavender lace. When you look at the cut-outs, it looks almost like a dragonfly. Very stretchy for all those ballet and dance movements. This is definitely going to make my granddaughter smile as she dances for us. Would be fun to put a little short skirt or tutu over it too. Just adorable!",1
"Title: Too many adjustments for something that should be easy
Review: I purchased this because I LOVE air popcorn and quit eating microwave a few years ago. I read many of the reviews about how to make great popcorn and adjustments in the arm. First, you may need to adjust the arm. The whole thing is cheaply made. Even after reading all these great reviews and strategies for using this.<br /><br />I liked the idea of having popcorn made and just flipping it and using the lid as the bowl.<br /><br />I have two types of popcorn and tried both with recommended oil. Both left many kernels in the bottom. I went and bought premium popcorn, which did better. But this take awhile to make and you have to watch it carefully. There are still a few kernels in the bottom even with premium popcorn.<br /><br />I have an air",0

"Title: Why have I never heard of this great game?
Review: I had never heard of this game before my daughter requested it for Christmas.  However, after having played it, I was a convert.  Like a good muppet movie, this game could be played by a young person in a simple way or enjoyed by adults at a more sophisticated level.  The concept of the game is simple but with a fun group you can liven up the game considerably by bartering, bargaining, forming alliances and creating a strategy to win.  Unlike games such as Monopoly, the board is cleverly designed and action cards just random enough so that every game is different.<br />The road and house game pieces are very, very small, so they should be kept well away from: small children, pets, the vacuum cleaner and slits between boards on the picnic ta",1
"Title: Strap so short that watch fell off while I was gardening
Review: I've bought several of these Timex watches before. This time I was surprised when I first put it on that the strap was unusually short -- and I have small wrists.  I wore it while doing some heavy yard work and when I went back inside the house I discovered it had fallen off .  I've searched but haven't been able to find it in the numerous piles of weeds and branches I'd accumulated, so that's $35 down the drain. I wouldn't order this unless you're prepared to buy a new strap for it immediately.",0

Review: So glad I found these and purchased them. They fit well, and work perfectly. Yes, they are matte, and I bought the black ones to use with my black stove. It has solved the issue with crumbs falling between stove and counter crack. Wipes off and cleans easily with damp sponge, and I wipe several times per day. No issues so far with heat damage or melting, and I’ve been using for a couple of weeks. They don’t even come close to touching the electric burner on my glass top stove. They stay put in place and do not move around.",1
"Title: Great collection on of early work at a bargain price
Review: I will not bore you by repeating the excellent details provided by other reviews (especially the January 4, 2012 one), including the detailed listing of albums this set contains. I will, however, gush about the value because what you get are some of Bud's best albums that are compiled into that I consider an essential set of his early work.<br /><br />What I will say is that the albums in this set have reasonable sound quality, reflect Bud's work across the board during his stronger period, and are albums that folks who either enjoy his playing or who want to study it will find valuable.<br /><br />Until I discovered this value-priced set of mainstream albums I was more than content with a 4-CD set titled [[ASIN:B00005CBXV Tempus Fugue-It]]",1

Review: For the price, you get a blow-molded plastic template in a plastic bag with a brochure mostly promoting other products. There's obviously a big markup and huge profit margin with this product.<br /><br />I bought this for a male friend, but he tried and couldn't use it since it very poorly fit his face, Out of all the photos and videos produced by this company I never found one where anyone actually used any of the products. It's all simulated and very misleading. It's also disappointing it doesn't seem to be as advertised.<br /><br />Several other men tried this and got the same results.

"Title: Bright headlights but install was a pain
Review: The lights are really bright and I am glad that I upgraded to these led lamps. The installation was very challenging primarily because it is not easy to reach into the engine cavity to first remove existing bulbs and find the slot to fit these bulbs. There is also a some kind of a heat sink fins that get really hot even after a short period of time.  Be careful handling if you need to adjust after running the lights for some time. There is also a kind of adapter that hangs from behind the bulb assembly that also felt hot so I had to zip tie the wires so that adapter does not touch any plastic parts. Overall very bright headlights that fit well. I am happy mith the upgrade",1

"Title: Exactly what I was looking for

The purse is considered medium in size, but I wanted measurements and could not find them anywhere so here they are: L10 x W 5.5 x H 11, approximate.<br />I would have given 5 stars however my bag arrived without a zipper pull on the top zipper, when I contacted amazon I was instructed that since this is a third party vendor I would need to return the item, a refund would be issued then I could reorder, instead I went to Jo Ann fabric and purchased an adorable butterfly zipper pull.

"Title: Sub-standard waste of money
Review: I was trying to save some money on what I consider to be over-priced OEM filters. I also wanted a product made in the USA. So, I ordered this product which seemed to satisfy what I wanted. First of all, the filters that arrived were in different packaging, and were labeled differently than the filter pictured here. Next I have to say that once this filter was installed, the water flow was severely restricted and the filter made a loud screaching noise when the water was trying to run. It took an inordinate amount of time to fill a drinking glass because the water barely trickled. So, I learned my lesson, and went back to Home Depot and paid the outrageous price for a filter that actually works. It appears that Amazon shipped the wrong item.",0
"Title: Unstable, Weak, Ruined Star-Quad Mic Cable
Review: Junk. Steer clear. Yes, there are thousands of good reviews from people who just received it, and when I first got it, I thought it was a good value too... But after using it over time, I never once able to get it to stay in position with the Shure SM7B. So frustrating to have to grapple with it EVERY time I used it. Unfortunately, all the motion of back and forth and trying to get it to stay up, it just broke the solder connection in a Canare star-quad cable. So now it's cost me much more than I paid for it. I finally broke down and bought a high quality boom from Gator.",0
"Title: Definitely Not Austen
Review: If you enjoy reading about young, pretty, professional women who lack the ability to accept kindness or to socialize, this book is for you. The heroine repeatedly, irritatingly, refuses help from the young handsome doctor next door. After four chapters I just had to put the book away. The insecure, unyielding, illogical demeanor of the female main character was so overwhelmingly ridiculous that I thought the book certainly must have been written by a man who hates women.<br /><br />The book bears no similarity to Jane Austen's brilliant works, beyond the name.",0

Review: On any run greater than five miles I load up on these.  I sweat a lot so I can't drink enough water before or during a run.  Plus, it isn't the water your body needs, it is the electrolytes.  I add four caps of this to a bottle of water and I am good to go.<br /><br />On Saturday I did my first half marathon and had no issues with cramping.  Previous to using this product, anything over 5 miles I really felt my muscles start to give in.  It was because they lacked electrolytes.  Not SUGAR.  This is great stuff.",1

Review: Decorum Restore Argan Oil Serum is light-weight and virtually odorless haircare products. It adds just the right amount of shine and made my hair look healthy. I would consider my hair to be coarse and I also have color. I used this serum after washing and conditioning my hair. I added a dime size amount to my slightly damp hair. I allowed my hair to self-dry (about 30 minutes) and followed it with my standard hair regiment. I have also used this product and immediately use a blow dryer to dry it. Regardless of the method used, guess what? After using this product, my hair didn’t look dry or brittle.  My hair was soft and manageable. This product includes argan oil and vitamin E (hence the shine). Decorum doesn’t have an unpleasant scent. I",1
"Title: cheaply made and messy
Review: When we bought the Keurig coffee maker we wanted to use our own coffee much of the time so we purchased 2 of these K-Cup Reusable Filters. They were a mess, water pouring out of the bottom, coffee grounds in the cups. I telephoned Keurig and the customer service rep told me to locate on the inside top of the machine the sharp object that punches the hole in the cups and also lines up with the opening in the My K-Cup. He told me to wiggle that rubber ""gasket"" down a bit and then it would make a tighter seal so the cups wouldn't leak water all over the place. So, we did that and it seemed to help for a while but still we had some leakage.<br />The other downside to this product is cleaning it out. We live in a rural area and have a septic sys",0

Review: This stuff is really grippy. I bought this and a pair of gloves woven with the same grippy material to use while Kayaking. I took some of the 3m material which comes with adhesive on one side like tape, and wound it around the paddle. With the gloves, it created an absolutely non-slip surface for paddling the kayak without the paddle handle rotating in my wet hands. I had a chance to try it out earlier this month on a local river with light rapids. The difference was immediately felt. I could paddle with more power, harder strokes and as I predicted, the paddle did not rotate in my wet hands like it did last year. This stuff is great for many uses...your imagination is the only limit.<br />I would say that it may be a little rough for bare ",1

We ordered a new bag in July and when we opened it a few weeks later the day they ate from the new bag they both got super sick vomiting everywhere in our house. Our 5 year old beautiful boy had complications and after visiting the vet 3 times they ended up having to put him down from the liver failure etc. He did have some other health issues- but the food definitely made both our dogs even our very healthy girl really really sick. I was told by an Amazon Rep that they would take the Salmon and lentil off the site but they did not. Most foods nowadays have had similar issues from dogs getting very sick.

Review: Having listened to several performances of Tartini's the Devil's Sonata this is simply gorgeous. Andrew Manze is breathtaking and amazing, to think it is only played by one man yet it seems like a full orchestra. The technique of the Devil's Sonata is estounding and truelly unigue and masterful, but with Manze it was made Heavenly. I was taken away by this CD and I think anyone with a true appreciation for beauty will be. I like to think Tartini would be proud of this performance.<br /><br />Angela.",1

Review: So first impressions of this chair it seemed nice.  However I did doubt the foot rest would last as soon as I first saw it.  It didn’t last a month.  Flimsy plastic pieces had it falling off every other use!  Also the cushions didn’t last long at all.  But the worst thing was the weld joints on the bottom of the chair broke not even 5 months after purchase making the chair useless.  What a waste of money!  I would avoid this chair like the plague!  Cheaply made and weld joints were barely there!  I’m actually surprised the chair last 5 months after looking at the welds.  Also the part that makes the chair lean back were garbage!  The chair wouldn’t stay in any position you put it in.",0

Then another 6 minutes 9 more cubes, and on and on until the basket was full or you run out of water. Only downside was it was a bit noisy if you plan to run overnight. But I was the only one that really noticed, but I'm the one that leaves reviews!  Haha. But honestly, I doubt that there are any that are much quieter, I mean, we're camping for gosh sakes! I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.",1

Review: There is no story.  Saying there are 6 short stories in the DVD is so wrong.  There are more like 6 10-15 minutes clips.  After I've finished watching the 6 clips, I am speechless.  I have to ask myself why I wasted my 60 or so minutes of my life to watch these clips.  If you want to waste $20 bucks for this DVD, I suggest you waste your cash on the 2 Batman Beyond movies with plenty of spare changes.  The two Batman Beyond movies with tons of extras are 1000x better than these clips in this DVD.<br /><br />This DVD is no go for me.  1 star it is.",0

Review: I have several Henckels blades as well as a few from Wusthof. I bought this to replace a Henckels serrated utility knife that went missing (I think it went with a pizza box...quite sad really).<br /><br />I have washed this knife twice and used it once. I washed it, by hand, the day I got it and put it away. I used it once this past weekend to slice a tomato and popped it in the dishwasher afterwards. The dishwasher was run and then emptied about an hour later; the knife blade came out with spots of rust/damage.<br /><br />Stainless steel is not supposed to rust.

It was recorded in NY on February 27, 1953 and released on November 2 of the same year under this title as well as Erroll Garner at the Piano (Columbia CL 535).<br /><br />A brief listen to the sound samples on this page is ample evidence of why I am elated. Each track is exquisite, and Caravan may be the definitive piano trio version of that Ellington/Tizol masterpiece.<br /><br />Garner is accompanied by Wyatt Ruther on bass and Eugene ""Fats"" Heard on drums, both of whom are down in the mix. Moreover, they are playing with a superb sense of dynamics that provides more of a rhythmic foundation for Garner than as a backing ensemble or musical collaboration. This alone makes this album worth studying fo",1
"Title: Honestly?
Review: My wife and I received this as a gift a while ago and just got around to setting it up.First off, I don't really understand the need for a weather station that needs to be connected to the internet. Wouldn't generic-[...] and a thermometer on the window do the same thing? Besides my lack of marketing savvy, which these guys apparently have a lot of; the thing does not work. First, the little transceiver (known as the ""gateway"") squeals like a little electronic locust, the kind of squeal that one might think would keep bugs away and irritate small mammals. They also require a registration process that seems simple enough but intrudes on the privacy a little. They want an e-mail address, no doubt to pawn off more of their wonderful product al",0
"Title: Spend the money buy something better
Review: Do not buy this product 1.the 2 piece pot and pan DO NOT hold together without a nylon webbing pouch it comes with 2. It says on the box you can fit a fuel cylinder and small stove top and pack it away but at the same time on the box it says you can only use wood or plastic utensils or youll scratch the coating inside??@$!' Does that sound like its made for a backpacker or for outdoor use this product in my eyes has a long way to go to be worth purchasing i would send it back but I only paid $11.00 roughly so not worth the time Do Not Buy!!!",0
"Title: Wow! I'm impressed. So many different colors
Review: Wow!! Wow wow wow!! These glitter pens really impressed me!! They have some sparkle!<br />There are some very dark ones, earth tones, neons, bright ones, very sheer ones that are so light but still show up, metallic and basic colors! I love this 100 glitter pen set!<br /> I was looking for glitter pens.. but wanted more variety. Boy did I find it in this set! I usually do what I call my ""testing page"" when I get a whole bunch of new colors at once, that way i can see and sort them in order from color or hues to dark to light and so on. I included a picture that I did using all 100 colors. The picture isnt finished because i only did one thing each color just to see the coverage and color it was. These are some of my favorite pens now. So ma",1
"Title: Elixir Shots with a Bunch of Recipe Cards
Review: I actually bought a bottle of this when I was shopping upstate in New Paltz, NY. It was being sold at a health food store and I bought the Ginger Elixir. The Hibiscus version tastes similar but with hibiscus, of course! It's pretty tasty and I use it to flavor my seltzer. It's good and doesn't upset my stomach. The Elixir comes well packaged with a barrage of recipe cards showing you how to use it in different ways. While I appreciate the gesture, the promotional cards were a bit much and kind of wasteful - I would have preferred a simple booklet instead of a bunch of separately printed, environmentally wasteful cards. Except for that, I love the product.",1
"Title: Worst software I've purchased in a long long time
Review: [[VIDEOID:795b2b848637b5a351a5f0fe66e806e5]] [[VIDEOID:aa429a80009d60bcc0fa8786f050a137]] Update: I have not heard from the company regarding a solution. This is crap! Do not waste your money.<br /><br /> I can't draw with this. I was using the free software which I really liked and so I purchased this to improve on what I had. Not only it is the total opposite of the free version (highly recommend it for amateurs). Don't bother buying this.<br /><br />The &#34;print&#34; is about 2 inches off from where I'm holding the stylus.

"Title: Probably the worst vinyl ever
Review: I've wrapped the entire interior of my car, exterior parts, my xbox, headlights, and other things in vinyl wrap so I'm not new to this. This is by far the worst quality vinyl I've ever worked with. I've even bought dirt cheap, super thin ebay vinyl for like $2 that was better than this. Immediately upon applying, it was covered in these weird scratch marks, which are not air bubbles. I thought it might go away once I smooth it out, apply heat, and push out the air bubbles. This was not the case. These crazy scratch marks are everywhere which completely ruins the aesthetics. I'll be looking into getting a refund. Maybe I just got a bad batch but I won't be buying from Vivid anytime soon.",0
"Title: Seems To Do What It Is Supposed To
Review: I take supplements only when it is necessary.  I have a sensitive system, so I test everything at low amounts and then work up if necessary.  Let's see what happened..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS SUPPLEMENT LIKE?<br />This supplement has a veg cap which is filled with glycerine/lecithin blend that has oats, st johns wort, schisandra, vervain, passionflower , gotu kola, ginkgo leaf and rosemary leaf.  There is a slight odor, but it is not at all bad or a turn off.  The bottle is dark brown glass.<br /><br />HOW EASY TO TAKE?<br />These did not have any problem when it came to taking them.  They are reasonable size and go down easily.<br /><br />BURP BACK?<br />No burping back was noticed with these pills.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS SUPPLEMENT PERFO",1
"Title: Amazing sound quality
Review: It comes with the  Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter, which lets you control the volume and mute the microphone, right on the controller.  It clips in on the bottom, right where the XBox One headset would go.  You then plug this, or any other headset, into that.  You will need to run a software update on your controller, but that's true of any headset that uses the stereo adapter.<br /><br />The microphone is excellent.  I'm told I sound very clear on it when using it for Skype.<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic.  It is a good enough approximation of 5.1 that I can tell if something is supposed to be in front of me and to the right, or behind me and to the right.  Or just flat to the right.  It also sounds open.  There is space in the",1
"Title: ZZZZZ - CURE FOR INSOMNIACS
Review: I once thought this band was a treasure; a perfect gem; three<br />pieces, great young instrumentalists, with a big wide future ahead in accoustic music; the first album, mostly<br />instrumentals mixed with a couple vocals was powerful, no, brilliant. and even though it's musical suicide to develop a<br />formula and trudge knowingly through it, these guys really<br />jumped overboard with this release. and without life jackets!<br /> This is a vocal album, there is only one instrumental track here, these people can carry a tune, but they are not pro<br />singers, they are players; this is the type of album a band puts<br />out after a long recording career establishing their ability -<br /> This record is like the cover, cute, and cartoon",0
"Title: Bocelli May Be Blind, But I'm Not Deaf
Review: I'll admit that I've only listened to excerpts of this Boheme recording from my local library, but as Ricky Ricardo used to say: ""Ay-ya-yay-ya-yay-ya-yay.....""<br />(By the way, Ricky Ricardo would have made a much more vocally secure Rodolfo).<br /><br />Bocelli's voice is tight and pinched, sounds like he's singing in his throat with no breath support.  He lunges at the high notes, then basically holds on for dear life.  Forget any interpretive insights into the character, it's basically ""Hey I can do this... kinda... no one will know the difference...""<br /><br />Frittoli sounds bored here and I can see why.  Mehta gives a run through of the opera, nothing too awful, it's just not really there, pretty anonymous music making.<br /><br />B",0
"Title: Paper not pink
Review: I purchased this product because of the pictures and description of the product. The seller posted images of the paper being a noticeable pink. Even the images of project examples show that the paper is pink. I planned to use the paper for a pink themed gift that I was sending overseas soon. Unfortunately, the color that was sent does not match my decorations. I included a photo of the product's sticker. The sticker also says the item is pink. I have not altered my attached photo in any way. The paper quality is typical of tissue paper. If you are looking for a pink tissue paper with metallic stars, understand that you may not get pink paper if you purchase this item.",0
"Title: Slightly Addictive
Review: This is my all time favorite game.  I've been playing for several months on multiple devices.  I will say I prefer the mobile version over the P.C. version.  However, they are both a lot of fun.  It is a slow-building game based on starting a farm and little town that eventually grown into something far larger.  My niece and nephew started playing it recently to dissuade them from playing violent games. They have improved their math skills as well as learning time management.  I highly recommend this game.",1
"Title: Cup of Yum
Review: My little dogs love this food. The tasters were two Chinese Crested dogs and my brother's shih tzu. The twenty-four pack contains two boxes of twelve cups . The foil lids are very secure making this a good choice for travel. The food is low odor and the aroma there is is mild and pleasant. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder . While I thought vomit in a plastic cup my dogs thought total deliciousness. None of them is especially picky but they ate this with more than there usual enthusiasm. I oberved no negatives after eating. Seems like a good foid.",1
"Title: For the classic gamer
Review: I bought two sets of these in different colors and left a similar review on the other set. The controllers work really well, and are great for a more casual gamer, someone buying them for their game cube/Wii, or for their Switch if they purchase an adapter like we did.<br /><br />However, some more serious gamers, like those who love Smash, may not find these to be 100% for them, The plastic is on the cheaper side, and some of the joy sticks and triggers suffer for it slightly. It's not going to be an issue most of the time, for most people (like me) but others might be more picky. The color variety is great, and were perfect for what we wanted, and they work great with the Switch adapter.",1
"Title: Reformulated and now irritating
Review: gWipes have gone the way of 7th Generation, meaning they reformulated their product. After 7th Generation reformulated their baby wipes and the new formula gave my baby diaper rash I went on the hunt for a new natural baby wipe. I ordered several natural baby wipes in single packets from Amazon and gave them a trial. Some caused irritation after the second day and some on the first. I was pleased to find that gWipes did not irritate my daughter so I ordered a case of them from gDiapers. Imagine how surprised I was when I received a completely different product. I immediately contacted customer support and told them they sent me the old formula because according to their website the new formula comes in a green package. I was kindly told tha",0
"Title: Very happy with ACDelco
Review: Fits a 2000 Chevy Impala perfectly. Came with the air tube for the motor cooling. That was a nice touch. Good air flow when running. Sound level is normal (44 dB on fan control level 1, 52 at 2, 58 at 3, 62 at 4, and 68 dB at the highest level 5). Also installed a GM Deflector (part no. 15794785) to prevent moisture from getting at the new motor as well as a cabin air filter. Watch a few videos online prior to taking on the project if you are not a mechanic.<br />If your fan is squealing all the time or after hitting a bump this repair will probably do the trick.",1

The steps are easy: if just using a card,pick the amount or put it in yourself, put in your info and submit it like an order. If using in a way for someone sending you it through an email, they send it using their card, then you go redeem it in your email, and it's in your amazon account. Very easy.

Review: IF YOU USE BANFIELD LISTEN UP: I purchased this for my puppy who is getting spayed. Banfield told me they do not allow their dogs to leave in any clothes. If they felt it was okay to bandage the dog, then they would. They do not do this because they want the stiches to air dry, and a suit such as the &#34;Suitical&#34; would lock in moisture. The cone, however shameful it might be, was invented for a reason. I am really disappointed that this company puts &#34;Veterinarian Recommended&#34; on their label, because they certainly were not recommended by my vet.",0
"Title: We liked this trike except for the fact that you can't ...
Review: We liked this trike except for the fact that you can't really fit it in the trunk of the car when the handle is on. But we could live with that. However, after a year of use - the mechanism that turns the pedals from standby to active broke and my daughter couldn't use the bike right when she became capable of using it. My husband is very handy but he couldn't fix it.<br />I didn't have time to write a review or ask for replacement then and decided just to buy a new one (without the handle because our child outgrew it, she can pedal herself now). So we bought fold-and-go trike instead because she is already familiar with it. Decided to give Radio Flyer another chance. Too bad - this one came damaged to start with. The mechanism that locks t",0
"Title: Terrible odor! Expected more from a burts bees product.
Review: These wipes are soft enough but they are thin and smell terrible. They smell the way wet laundry might smell if you forget to transfer it to the dryer and leave it in the washer for too long. Disgusting. I have used many other brands of unscented wipes and they don't smell like this. I recommend the honest brand wipes which cost the same as these, but are thicker, sturdier, and most importantly, don't stink. I don't understand how a product meant to clean a baby's sensitive areas can smell so awful. A complete waste of money.",0
"Title: Not what I was expecting
Review: I purchased this because I was in the midst of preparing a college paper on Twain's use of religion and superstition in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but it not only was not what I expected, it ended up being of no use. I gained no insight into what Twain might have thought or felt at the time of writing Huck Finn because these were works from later in his life -- from a darker, more depressed state of mind. I could not even find enjoyment in reading it outside of the need created by the paper I was writing; this was not the Twain with whom I was familiar. A darker, more hopeless author conceived these pieces, and I found his state of mind entirely depressing.",0
"Title: Love the Color Variety and Packaging!
Review: I'm very happy with my 35 Colors Pigment Powder Dye set from Gruifh. I appreciate that the powders come in a little jar. This is much easier for me to handle than re-sealable bags. Tiny spoons were a thoughtful inclusion into the package. Mica powder is a great supply for a variety of arts and crafts. I am fond of using it with acrylic mediums and paints to make a metallic effect. It's body safe and very pretty when added to soaps and cosmetics as well. This order made for a very generous supply of powders. I usually add 1 gram per 1-5 ounces of liquid. I'd advise to start out with a very small amount of powder and mix in more for deeper saturation. The packaging is very nice and would make a great presentation as a gift. I hope you find my",1

Review: I am disabled with arthritis and doctor had suggested this type of shoe for comfortable, daily wear.  Even my big strong husband could not put more than the tips of my toes into these awful shoes!  Really.  And the really sad part is that they are so lovely to look at.  The intention was a shoe that I could ""slip into. ""  This shoe is so narrow that it even fights back when I tried putting my hand inside!  I even bought a size bigger, just to be on safe side!!!!

"Title: Low quality
Review: I initially purchased Rainbird and Watts water pressure gauges from a big box store and one never worked and the other filled up with water, so I bought this one off Amazon.com hoping for better results.<br /><br />Here's why I took away four stars:<br />- the red indicator hand moves too easily and gets flung all the way around when I turn on the water.  It is repeatable and does it every time.<br />- the gauge filled up with water in less than 20 minutes.  Whether this impacts the accuracy or not, it's doesn't seem right and I'm concerned that internal components will rust.

"Title: Wonderful Wiz, but Be Warned
Review: One of the best collection of Wizard of Oz slot games available today.  Wonderful graphics and fun Wizard of Oz characters, voices, and music.  This one has all the magic from spinning twisters to Munchkinland, to the Wicked Wicked screaming that she's going to get your little dog too.  And oh those Ruby Slippers, watch Dorothy as she taps them along the Yellow Brick Road on her way through Oz.<br /><br />One word of advice, when you're done playing, make sure you close the app.  Just remember that Oz and its environs, i.e. the Emerald City,  are power hungry, so you don't want this App running in the background gobbling up your Device's Energy.  Close it.  It's easy, even if you don't read instructions.  After you finish playing, tap your ",1
"Title: 3’x3’ playing and learning pad
Review: These are cute and we loved the color but keep in mind that you will need quite a few if you are trying to cover a full floor. It comes with about 9 of the 12”x12” squares. So one set will only cover about a 3’x3’ area. So if you want to cover a full area you’ll need to order a few sets.<br /><br />I think these are a great little toy if you wanted to make cubes are use them to teach letters.<br /><br />Due to them being about half an inch thick, I’d say they are better for a learning tool and less useful for a foam floor covering",1

She used it on her eyebrows,  and then had some product left over and did my eyebrows.  I'm 45, and I have some silver eyebrow hairs that I haven't been real happy with =) and you can't pluck the darn things or soon you'll have no brows left.

They played with it for a while, and had a lot of fun.<br /><br />We have many toys from this company. They make a lot of different products and we have generally been very happy with them. It worked well.<br /><br />This toy was durable. My kids can be a little rough with toys, but this continued to work just fine.

"Title: Get the FLAVOR Ones, Not Plain
Review: This is a product like I have never seen before. Of course I've had croutons, but never such perfectly shaped little squares that pack such an enormous crunch.<br />This review is for the flavored variety. I don't think I would like them plain because then it would just be crunch with nothing else. But each one of these bursts with a deliciously salty flavor that adds so much to soups and salad.<br />Easy to pour out of the container, which closes to keep the croutons fresh.<br />Because of the size and shape, I find that you don't need as many of them as you would with large size croutons. That's a carb and calorie saver.",1
"Title: Leaves a light residue behind, ok cleaner.
Review: I used this to remove a dirty footprint the dealer mechanic left on the carpet (not a dark stain).  Diluted 10:1, scrubbed with brush, and wiped dry with clean towels.  It removed about 80% of the dirt footprint.  It is a decent cleaner but the carpet now feels like there is a residue left behind.  Does not feel clean and dry.  Tacky, waxy, sticky reside.  Something along those lines.  I have always used Meguiars carpet but wanted to try this.  Now I will buy Meguiars again, and go over all the carpet I cleaned with CG and hopefully the residual I feel will come out.  Might work better with a hot water detail extractor.",0

I have three different products that claim to do just that sitting in my makeup drawer that did not live up to those claims. In my continued search, I found the Flaire Flawless Painless Hair Remover on Amazon.

They aren't ""designer"" but they are functional as cross over bags with enough space to hold your wallet and a few other things without being so large that you killing your back carrying it.  I also like the zippered side that when you unzip you can slide onto your luggage handle.  So, when we CAN travel again, it's handy for weight and function.  I have the black, the black with a sort of leopard embossing, and this one - a mushroom taupe.  I've lived through the I-gotta-have-the-designer bag.

"Title: Great Civilization-type game
Review: I really like this game. I think it's entertaining and challenging without getting too frustrating. When I bought this game - free at the time I purchased it - I was looking for a simple game like civilization to play on my kindle. I decided to try this game out. It took me about 15 minutes to &#34;figure out&#34; how to play. This game wasn't immediately intuitive for me, but after some trial and error I got the hang of it . Once I figured out how to play, I didn't want to stop! This is a good game to play if you want to disengage from the world for a few (or many) hours and probably would be best played on a day off from work.<br /><br />I wasn't ever very good at History and I recently taught myself American History and Ancient Civilizat",1
"Title: Stylish black tumbler

I for one am a huge fan and love taking these to social gatherings or even when I go to a BYOB when I drink white wine that I am chilling and want to stay cold. They are also great for bringing along your drink to anywhere really, have a hot cup of tea or coffee at any time, or drink my soda at home.<br /><br />Each of these comes with a lid that has an air hole in it as well as a hole for a straw. It has a seal that prevents it from spilling which is great. It is splash proof but not leak proof so keep that in mind. It keeps your hot beverage hot for 3 hours and cold beverage cold for 9 hours.

I will spare readers of the detail of owning this unit. However, stay away at all costs. Arguementive customer service refused to consider the unit was faulty and refused return. Too small of wiring for a.c. input eventually melted terminal strip, luckily found before fire. Internal wiring should have been 10 gauge for advertised wattages.

"Title: Not very practical or safe for pooches
Review: My dog is a chewer and usually likes to play with the plush toys as they last longer. I originally thought it was &#34;cute&#34; to have the thing say &#34;OH NO&#34; while he was chewing on it until the day when he managed to rip the &#34;voice box&#34; out of the toy, bit down and broke it in half.  Too many dangerous parts for a dog, if swallowed so thank goodness I was home when it happened. My dog is by no means a small doy (he's a Samoyed), so will definitely stick to the squeaker toys for him.",0
"Title: Second replaced part not working properly either.
Review: This is the second  motor we ordered from you. The first one made a loud humming noise and acted as it the fan blade was getting caught on something so we decided to order another motor along with a new fan blade this time thinking that since the product was a part number that was no longer made and was being replaced with another one that we probably needed to also get the new fan blade that was made to go along with it, instead of using our original fan blade. However, after installing both the second new fan motor and new fan blade the loud humming sound started up again, not right away, but a few hours later. So we would like to return the second motor and fan blade. What do you think the problem is with the two fan motors we have purch",0

Review: CoQ10 is used in each of our cells. It is essential to heart health, metabolism, cellular health, fertility and exercise recovery. CoQ10 is a precursor to ubiquinol.

Keeping with their traditional feel from earlier CDs, this CD brings a delightful balance of harmonies and celtic instruments in one amazing performance!

"Title: NOT 100% fruit juice.
Review: My bad—I bought this V8 Peach-Mango ‘juice’ based on the large graphic of the bottle on the product page, which clearly states “100% Fruit Juice”.  I should have read the ingredients listed in the last graphic and in the complete description. This is NOT ‘100% fruit juice’ if by that is meant ONLY peach juice + mango juice.  What you get is mostly water, in which they put some pieces of peach, apples, couple of grapes & my guess is maybe a tablespoon of mango puree, let it sit for maybe 30 minutes and stirred it.  But wait—there’s more:  then they tossed in a few chunks of sweet potato and pieces of carrots, stirred it a little more, drained off the liquid, added to it some coloring, some “flavoring” (??) and vitamin C.

I can not keep ear buds to stay in so I wanted headphones to ""cup"" my ears - which is what the add intimated that I was buying - ""over the ears"". If you bend over at a ~25 degree angel or more they will fall off. Any sweat and it gets worse. I have to do low impact exercises and long walks. One toe-toucher and their gone - stair stepper will launch them - forget sit ups and push ups. Walking and stationary bike are about it or couch-potato. It does have a buzzing noise, but the book or music drown it out. If all you want is to sit and listen the quality of sound is pr",0
"Title: SD card reader doesn't work, it is defective
Review: The SD reader would not accept the SD card (it didn't fit, ended up crooked)… and therefore the reader didn't recognize any SD card was present.  It was not the card, I tried that on other readers and it was fine.  Took me forever to figure it out it wasn't working because there are pretty much no instructions about what should happen.  Only the micro reader worked.  Extremely disappointing since I leave on vacation tomorrow and there's no time to buy an alternative. But trust me, there is time to drop this piece of junk at UPS to get my money back.",0
"Title: Citri-dip
Review: I bought this because I read so much good stuff about this for removing the terrible orange color of SX bass guitar necks. Well, either the SX-factory changed their lacquer or Citristrip changed their product because nothing happend to the finish of the bass neck. Completely nothing! Even after 23 hours, of which two and a half with the neck wrapped in foil. In the end I had to remove the lacquer with a scraper and had to sand it all. I can't be certain that it's the Citristrip that's not working, but for me it was not the succes I hoped for.<br />Tools & Home Improvement did their best though! The product was sent very quickly to the Netherlands (Europe) and very well packed. Cudo's!",0

Review: I've been using these for a about 4 weeks in my daughter's reading light and they're lasting a long time. She's 6yo and really huge into building forts right now. She also has to have a light source inside the tent with her, and so she leaves her book light on for hours. They don't make rechargeable batteries in this size, so I was really excited to come across this brand! And boy, am I am impressed with these batteries so far! They've lasted several weeks now and they really great. They arrived quick too; Amazon delivered them the next day!!!",1
"Title: Nice all metal printed sign
Review: Seems like we recently saw a serious spike in door to door sales people. I mean literally everyday one would come by. While we didn't want an overly rude sign this one fits the bill. It's metal although maybe not a very stiff sheet metal. It's a little big but who cares the point is to get the message, don't ring this doorbell trying to sell me a new roof when ours is only 3 years old, solar panels, or whatever other non sense a door to door sales person would say. It also works on Jehovah witnesses and their weekend visits. Seriously, not interested go home and be with your family.",1
"Title: Great Color, Quality Print
Review: I would say for the money this mat has been great. The print is excellent quality and has great color depth. The edges are engineered well and I have zero issues with fraying so far. The rubber hasn't fallen apart, but I also haven't done a wash on this mat yet (wash your desk mats, they are nastier than you think). Size wise it is true to what is advertised and fits a trackpad, Keychron K2, and an A5 journal.<br /><br />To clean your desk pad (I've done this for years without issue, but milage may very. Try at your own risk):<br />1) put in bottom of clean (duh) bath or shower, spray with warm (almost cold) water<br />2) put about 1T of dish soap on it and agitate for a bit<br />3) rinse with shower head until water runs clear<br />4) roll",1
"Title: Great
Review: After trying out a Philips (Norelco) 7120 to see if I could escape the wet razor trap I was ready for the next step; that model worked fine, except that by design the battery doesn't last that long and I could seldom get an acceptable shave around the neck. The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses) and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).<br /><br />It comes with a travel ""sarcophagus"" (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done qui",1
"Title: Worst OZ product ever-- and I'm a fan generally
Review: Worst product ever-- and it takes a lot for me to say this because I'm a fan of OZ Naturals.  Terrible smell, feels like wet paste on your skin and dries to a tight, pasty finish.  It reminds me of a face mask that dries to a clear matte finish before you wash it off.  It makes your skin feel tight and uncomfortable.<br />Note to OZ NATURALS:  Take this back and reformulate it because it is your worst product ever.  If I could return it to you (I no longer have packaging), I would return it in a heartbeat.<br />If you've just purchased it, do yourself a favor and ship it back because I'll be shocked if  you like it.  However, if you DO like it, and you find your experience vastly different from what I've tried to describe here, please let m",0

Thick black paint, much much better than Uhaul hitches. I will never buy another brand of hitch again.<br />I have installed a few hitches and this was super easy. It took me about 45 minutes all on my own.<br />I took the advise of raising the back of the car to make access easier as you can see from the photo just a brick paver made the difference.<br />To remove the rubber exhaust mounts I sprayed WD40 and it slipped right off.<br />This was super easy and I will not buy another brand of hitch again!!",1

"Title: Delicious, gluten-free flour
Review: For some time now I have been grinding up coconut flakes to make my own rough-and-ready coconut flour, and I at last decided to simply purchase some coconut flour. I was interested to see that this flour has far, far less fat in it than ground up coconut flakes. I can only assume that this is because the coconut pulp that is dried to be ground into flour has first been squeezed to remove coconut oil, which is sold separately.<br /><br />I use this flour in muffins, soup, and vegan ice cream. It tastes almost as good as ground up coconut flakes for these three purposes, and it saves a lot of calories.<br /><br />My recipe for a really creamy, delicious, tropical ice cream is:<br /><br />1 ripe mango, peeled<br />1 ripe banana, peeled<br />5 ",1
"Title: Size does matter
Review: I accepted this as a product sample because I was truly curious about the 'biggest' claim made in the product description. It's true - or when compared to the two other metal juicers I own. In fact, this one will easily squeeze most oranges and is the only one that will work with the giant lemons a friend gives me from her grove.<br /><br />Everything about this squeezer appeals to me. It's size, of course, which can accommodate a fruit up to 3.75 inches in diameter, is my main reason for loving it. With my other squeezers I had to juice my friend's lemons by hand because they were way to large.<br /><br />The leverage the handles provide is another factor in my five star award. The large lemons and the single orange with which I tested thi",1
"Title: Great Filter for my Broan Range Hood
Review: The old filter that was on my Broan range hood was quite flimsy.  You could see through it and consisted of only the metal weaving.  This one is sturdy, has a backing that might/could be the charcoal??  In any case, it is a much sturdier filter than the one I bought 7 years ago.  I kept the old one clean by putting it in Dawn and hot water regularly, plus an occasional trip to the upper part of my dishwasher.  The old filter was squeaky clean when I discarded it, but wasn't filtering as well as this new one.  To summarize, this filter is far superior to the one I bought in an appliance store and used for so many years.  I will order this one again when needed.",1

"Title: Excellent app for the Fire (original model)
Review: This is a must-have app if you're a fan of TED talks. The video and audio are very clear and stream smoothly in HD. What I like the best is that the talks are organized and cross-referenced by topic and genre - I've been able to find several TED talks I've not seen before. Plus, when a talk is finished, it allows you to hit a button and be presented with a list of similar talks.<br /><br />You can download talks to the Fire in either low or high res. That's a great feature for times when I won't have wifi access. The downloaded videos are available in the My Talks tab in the app. You can easily delete them (press and hold the video title and a menu comes up) if things get too cluttered. You can also bookmark talks for streaming later, with ",1

Review: DO NOT BUY. I bought two. One of the collars looked like it had been handled, (packed differently, not as neat and tidy as the other one). I figured no big deal and plugged them both in to my laptop. You can only a 1A charger so have fun findiing one of those laying around. Bought one of them for a Great P. and realized there is no way to adjust the pins to get through his fur, goes on another dog i guess but be forewarned, you cannot adjust the pin size.

Review: I, for some reason or another, always get baited into upgrading every year. For the most part it's without incident, in fact I can't think of ever really having issues with Quicken. But this years upgrade has been a problem for me.<br /><br />First, from ""new features"" -- I don't really see any. Sure there's the mobile stuff, but, I use a Windows Phone 8, and as usual, Intuit feels like that's not worth developing for. Honestly, not a big deal as I probably wouldn't use those features anyways.<br /><br />But the problems. They're quite apparent. First, it is slooooow. No, not an issue with my computer, the software itself is just slow to read and write from its file. Especially when entering transactions into the register. It actually gets ",0
"Title: 4 watt heating pad w/ fleece sleeve, double decker cube, bed w/ scratcher above, catnip included
Review: This review is for the ""Playhouse"" option.<br /><br />We love K&H products. We have been especially keen on using their heating pads for several years now. Between our aging kitties, and even our well ""insulated"" *cough-fat-cough* tabby, they have all enjoyed luxuriating on a heating pad during the coldest days of winter. We don't keep a real warm house, so cozy spots are a must.<br /><br />The heating pads are great. The level of heat is akin to the warmth left behind when someone has been sitting in a spot for awhile. They aren't the kind that get hot, which is good. They are very low wattage (4 watts) and produce a ""barely there"" level of warmth to the touch, but it is enough to allow a cat or dog to get warm, stay warm and not have to r",1

"Title: Exceptional Quality
Review: I ordered a set of 'Sublimation Blanks Round Coasters 4x4 inch PU Leather Sublimation Coaster Blanks' for review.  We have a professional sublimation printer and my wife has had the opportunity to use a multitude of blanks in several price ranges.  These are relatively inexpensive and the quality far exceeds their price point.  They are stitched evenly.  Are made of a nice PU leather, nice and rigid, unlike others my wife has used that are more like mousepads versus a coaster.  My wife would not hesitate to order several sets of these to use for resale.  They sublimation ink takes very well, the images come out vivid.  Overall, my wife was incredibly impressed with these coaster blanks.  In the future she will forgo more expensive brands an",1
"Title: Assault
Review: Initially I was just going to respond to the fact that I’m the first book: a large woman fell in love with a guy from this planet. They were both in love but didn’t tell each other. They had sex before it was acceptable according to the male’s code of honor. They marry and live happily ever after. This book: a large woman falls in love with a guy from this planet. They were both in love with each other…. You get the point. But in this book, sexual assault is treated as no big deal. The male watches the woman masterbates (sp) without her knowledge and then has sex with her while she’s asleep without her knowledge. By any definition that’s sexual assault. No.",0
"Title: Does absolutely nothing.
Review: Does nothing. At all. I have a front loading washing machine, stacked, on the second floor of my home. It did nothing to reduce the vibrations whatsoever. Our house would literally shake every time it would wind up into the spin cycle. I did research and looked into the 0VIB by Seicon. It's a lot more pricey than 25 dollars, but it does the trick. I honestly thought it was too good to be true, then discovered it really wasn't. We went from the whole house shaking to barely feeling any sort of vibrations from the machine when standing within two feet of the washer. It's backed by Consumer Reports and has a 100% money back guarantee. You really can't go wrong.",0

Quite frankly I didn't think we would be writing any adverse review for any Apple product.

Worked just like Andersen's levelers.<br /><br />Compared to similar products this one seems the same. It feels very well made and offers easy solution to leveling your rv or travel trailer. It comes with non slip mats which most of the others do not. It also has an option to use these as a tongue stand to rest for the camper to keep it raised up. Overall I'm satisfied with the product. I will be taking more pictures of the item in actual use and i will also update this review if needed after a couple of uses while camping.",1
"Title: A fantastic gift for a tea lover or for yourself
Review: This is a fantastic tester set of tea and has a wide variety of flavors of caffeinated black tea to suit a wide variety of moods. I think my favorite was the caramel brownie, followed by the crème brûlée flavor. It was also interesting to try the variety of plain black teas and to notice the differing flavors of each. I think it increased my enjoyment of tea in general to have a subtle understanding of some of the differences of the flavor profiles of black tea.<br /><br />I use the little tea filters that are available in many brands on Amazon to put the loose black tea in and steep it. I found that this results in the best flavor for me as opposed to using the little metal steeping baskets. I have a 20 ounce cup that I use for tea, and th",1

And since when are they doubling up months on print issues?<br /><br />I found these two errors in the span of about 10 minutes of flipping through.

Review: It looks enough like hand cream, I can get away with it at Planet Fitness. I get in trouble with my other one that looks like a netted ball of chalk. It helped a lot with kettlebell swings. I have a bad grip with that when my hands get sweaty, and I have no idea why anyone would want a heavy metal ball to go flying randomly. This helps me get a better grip on it. It makes the whole process gentler on my hands, so I don't get those nasty callouses on the pads where the fingers meet the palm. I hate those.

This had a ton of positive reviews, and is currently holding a 36"" tube feeder and a metal suet feeder, and I am sure it will hold more on the remaining arms.  The finial at the top is attractive and the curls at the end of the arms seems to make it relatively wind-resistant.  So far, so good, and nice-looking too!",1

I attempted to hang a key chain with a single plastic key on it and it fell right off.

The way the camera on the phone is these need to be cutout around the lenses or have double layer where the lens doesn't see through it.

I wanted a &#34;blanket-style&#34; bag that would open flat and for the most part serve as a dust cover for my &#34;tinkering at home&#34; PSR-E453 that pretty much stays on the stand.  The bag is sturdily constructed of 600 denier material, and the interior is completely padded (I'd estimate the padding at nearly 7/16&#34;) with a soft brushed covering.

Worked OK for a while (about a year) then started to leak at relief anytime tank pressure went below setting. Infrequent use. Sometimes you can get it to stop by raising/ lowering the pressure.

Review: This is a very informative movie that has a very personal insight into the man that wrote one of the greatest books of our time. If you are sensitive to a lot of blood and the cold hard truth, this is probably not a movie to put on the top of your watch list. It was an amazing insight into how much of himself Capote put into the research and personal lives of the killers. He was compassionate enough to still see them as human. He tried to treat them with respect to get his story and the facts he wanted, but got too close on a personal level. It appears he never recovered from the ordeal.

There have even been cases of dog deaths due to consuming rawhide from China.<br /><br />I decided, against my better judgment, to give this to my dog just once for Christmas Eve anyway (figuring Ranch Rewards was a reputable company and it shouldn't be harmful).  We woke up at 0300 to my poor dog vomiting on the bed.  She threw up 3 more times on the floor and in the bathroom.  It was red with chunks of rawhide in it.  She does not normally throw up and she hadn't ",0
"Title: Poor Performance
Review: I ordered these socks because I needed something to avoid blisters on the backs of my heels when wearing boat shoes barefooted.  According to the advertisement and pictures, this should have not been any problem due to their touted ""Non-Slip Grip"".  Well, they arrived yesterday and I wore a pair for the first time today.  By early afternoon, the non-slip sock had slipped all the way down the back of my heel and puddled up a bit under the sole of my foot....both sides.  Luckily, on the same day I had also ordered the M&Z no show socks (just to compare) and they had arrived a day or two earlier, giving me the opportunity to see if one was preferable over the other.  It wasn't even close.  The M&Z socks were quite comfortable, didn't slip all ",0
"Title: Holderlin's fantastic dream
Review: And what a dream it is!  Here's a challenge:  how do you describe a great album when you can't understand the lyrics?  The album's name is `Traum', which is the German word for dream.  Dream-like is as perfect a description as any for this surreal folk.  The music is acoustic and often accompanied by flute and dark organ/mellotron.  ""Waren wir"" and the title track, which open and close the album respectively are the most complete songs; they feature the entire band:  drum, bass, organ, flute, acoustic guitar.  The drummer, whose listed name is simply Michael, is essential to these tracks.  His rock-jazz style lends these two tracks an ominous urgency that carries them (and the album as a whole) far above and beyond the rest of the folk-rock",1
"Title: DOA
Review: Yeah, I know sometimes you receive a defective unit, but it's an inconvenience and a hassle. This thing didn't work at all, whether I had a single device plugged into it, or three devices (DVR, Blu-ray player, and Apple TV). Its red LED lit up, but it did nothing. My TV consistently showed the &#34;No signal&#34; alert, and the screen was dark. When these devices are  plugged directly into the TV, the video displays on the screen with no problems, so obviously, this HDMI switch is defective.<br /><br />I returned it, and won't be buying another one.<br /><br />1/15/17 update: after I wrote this one-star review, the seller contacted me and offered to replace the defective unit, but I had already decided to buy a different HDMI switch.

"Title: Retarded UI would be ok, but the units fail repeatedly...
Review: I have to give Aprilaire engineers an award. An award for worst engineering effort since the square wheel.<br />I have gone through maybe 3 of these units, and every six-nine months their internal firmware bricks the unit up, so that it cannot be upgraded or updated or reset or reboot or anything. From reading other reviews, others have experienced the same thing.<br />Tech support from Aprilaire was good initially, but the guy just stopped responding after I kept coming back with the same failure.<br /><br />Bottom line: stay away from Aprilaire, stay away for sure from this 8825.<br /><br />Aprilaire engineering: you suck. tear up your AA degree and apply immediately to McDonalds.",0
"Title: No melodies that stick in your mind
Review: The fatal flaw in this album is the lack of remarkable melodies in the songs.  There is nothing memorable in the writing here.  Nothing that catches ones interest or sticks in the brain in terms of the melodies. The lyrics are good.  Amy Ray's electric guitar work is simplistic.  Surprisingly, Emily's vocals lack the past satin quality she's shown and Amy's voice is smoky, and not in a way that adds texture. There are probably 2 songs here that are worth retaining, one of them being &#34;Texas&#34;.  Then there are embarrassing numbers like Findlay Ohio where the melodic line and singing are just off.  The use of a cello and violin is very interesting, but the vocal line is just bad. A surprisingly uninteresting album.",0

Review: I bought these on ebay from same seller, and thought they were a little fragile but seemed okay. Then after a few wearings there was no tension in one of the earrings and it wouldn't stay on. Just too cheap. There is another seller on ebay that is selling the exact same earrings for ~$5, so gives you an idea of quality and I wouldn't have bought them if I had seen that first.<br /><br />I wrote the seller and he said that this has never happened unless the earrings were bent by the buyer. Well, they are as round as the day I got them (see pic). Not worth the time and money to exchange them, especially if you can get another new pair for $5 which is less than the money you would lose sending them back to AJ.",0

"Title: Great price, but the foam disintegrates after a couple of paint strokes
Review: Years ago I purchased 100 of these paintbrushes and used them for all kinds of tasks, including wood glue applications. I never had an issue with those brushes. These foam brushes disintegrate after a couple of paint strokes. I found it funny that people rated ""Easy to Clean"". Mine fell apart during a small paint job, so there was nothing left to be cleaned. I guess I got what I paid for.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />These brushes are falling apart applying wood glue. They come off the handle fairly quickly. I downgrade them to a 1 star. Not worth the money and the hassle.",0

Review: Update: my initial review was basically - has some issues, and given the reason I bought it (just wanted the shape), the issues weren't worth my time.  Basically, not terrible, just not for me.  Well - I've since noticed that unless you like baking on old grease, you should probably not use this.  I went to get it out yesterday to give it to a friend and see what she could make of the uneven cooking issue, and I realized it had white film all over it - I then realized this was residual oil.  The last time I washed it was with the dishwasher, and I thought it was just fine (per my review below), but clearly it didn't effectively wash at all.  Obviously I wasn't going to give that grossness to my friend, so I went to wash it by hand - I tried",0

Prior to going on their honeymoon, they received a mysterious gift from one of Alice’s high profile clients, and were told that everything would be explained to them when returned from vacation. Upon arriving home, they meet Vivian, who explains that they have been invited to join a secret membership-only group known as The Pact.<br /><br />The Pact promises to support them in their desire to have a happy and fulfilled marriage.

"Title: seasoned cold brewer here, lots of info below, brewer works great, easy to use
Review: I have been drinking ""cold brew"" for well over a decade now. The occasional coffee house would have a cold brew system, and so it was a treat back then to purchase a cup of extra strong and extra smooth coffee. Then I started making it at home. There were no special brew systems yet available. So I would simply take a big pitcher dump a bunch of ground coffee into it, then top it off with water. Cover, let sit for a full day, then either carefully pour into a cup as desired (while trying to keep grounds from falling out), or when I was feeling more motivated I would strain through a cheesecloth. Either way, I had easy cold brewed coffee. YUM.<br /><br />Forward to the past several years where cold brew coffee has hit critical mass. Most eve",1

Review: Inconsistent quality of products. Like quite a few other reviewers, this was a gift to my mother. She classified the texture equal to stale 4 day old bread. It was tough to cut and would not even warm up in the microwave. No 92 year old should have to gnaw on a bad product because they feel good money has been spent on a cinnamon bread that can’t even be cut!! And, because there is no way to return their product because they don’t accept returns, they can’t visually see what they sent. Disappointed to say the least. Will be looking elsewhere.",0
"Title: Complete garbage
Review: This is legitimately the worst quality toy I have ever bought for my children. Putting it together took an hour. There is a design flaw so you can’t put the toys back in the machine without taking it completely apart. The claw on ours doesn’t move up and down, just back-and-forth. It’s incredibly slow. The top light bar doesn’t work. I made sure to buy one that had really good reviews and I am shocked at what a piece of junk this is. A family member has a different brand with awful reviews and theirs works 100% better and the quality is 100% nicer.  Returning this one and getting a different brand.  Good thing I set it up and realized this before my kids opened it Christmas morning.",0
"Title: AARRRRRRRGH!
Review: My immediate reaction upon listening to this album? Anger! No wonder they named it &quot;St. Anger&quot;, it's a pretentious title for a pretentious album by a hugely pretentious band. Any artist who think they can make their fans wait six years (especially after a mediocre album) before unloading this drivel on them should be stripped of their &quot;artist&quot; rank and sent away to wallow in obscurity. This album reeks like wet garbage on a hot July day: the stench is indescribable and the further you are away from it, the better. Aurally, it is a barbed-wire towel rubbing your eardrums raw and pounding your already furious brain into a bloody pulp.<br />Whatever melody, whatever guitar/vocal skill, whatever meaningful lyrics they have E",0
"Title: Great Recovery from Last Year's Debacle - Definitely Recommend TurboTax 2015
Review: I'm glad to see that Intuit listened to their customers and restored the functionality that was removed last year. The interface with the 2015 version is very straight-forward and easy to navigate. Last year I decided to purchase H&R Block's TaxCut software since TurboTax decided to remove several forms from their deluxe version. I ended up owing $75 dollars more (after filing electronically) along with a penalty since the TaxCut software screwed up my return. I've never had that problem with TurboTax. I think this year's TurboTax is very well done and I hope Intuit continues to provide similar functionality in future versions.",1
"Title: Works great, no real drop in pressure
Review: So I was concerned because of the smaller hose diameter that there would be a significant drop in pressure.  That doesn't seem to be the case.  Word of warning though, I had bought this for my elderly mother because a regular garden hose has just gotten too heavy for her.  The spring shape is always pulling back against her when she moves so it ended up being even harder.  I told her to give it some time as it starts to ease up over time like our neighbor's.  I will say though that because of the shape, you could call it 50' but the spring back makes it feel less.  You gotta think about your garden/yard situation and how you're going to maneuver this hose around.  If you have a lot of fragile garden flowers and plants you may want to go wit",1

Of course, if your eyes are not evenly going bad, one eye far worse than the other, these will not work for you. But for most of us, they will work just fine.

Review: The bottles are very nice - fairly hard, dense plastic that feels sturdy and durable.  I like that the bottles are clear so that you can see what is in them easily.  Comes with labels and two small funnels to assist in filling the bottles.  These seem leak-proof and I like the misting action.  Also comes with a plastic cap to cover the spray nozzle.  These are great for traveling, your car, purse, your pocket, etc.  I filled one up with rubbing alcohol to keep in the car as a disinfectant (don’t leave it in the sun though!).  Also good for hairspray, water (as a cooling solution), facial toner, etc.  The size is perfect - small enough for portability but holds enough volume to make it worthwhile.",1

Review: My typical use is when I'm watching my tablet while doing dishes.  I cannot comment on ""sound cancellation"" as I generally only have one ear piece in; however, when both ear pieces are wedged in, it becomes an ear plug (like all other earbuds).  The bass is pronounced w/o being over bearing, highs and mids still come through clear and not muddied - the overall sound fidelity is great (compared to the Mpow Flame).  If the unit is still selling for less than $40 (even $50) - I would definitely say buy them over the Mpow Flame in this category.  Battery life is actually the 5+hours they claim.",1

After testing, I ordered another unit for my Android phone and the cord it comes with does fit the phone.<br /><br />The Anker did not really need to include any cord because to recharge the unit, you have to provide your own wall-socket transformer anyway, which you have on your phone's charger, so why not just use that cord to also recharge the Anker?

Placing the animal in the ring is fun as well.  Skip Hop Zoo faces tend to bring a smile to the baby's face and even though he can't squeeze these yet, in time, I know he will have a ball.  This set is adorable and well made so I expect the set to last longer than the interest of a single child.  I also personally find that they are cute enough to",1
"Title: Not satisfied with my orders
Review: All three books from all three sellers were not as represented in their ads.  NONE of them were &#34;New&#34; as stated.  Two of them had writing in the books and the third was not even the book I ordered.  It was a USED BRITISH (purple) version and not the NEW version shown in the ad.  The first two sellers resolved the issues but the third STILL hasn't given me a refund.  I sent the book back (at the seller's request) and it has been 11 days since it was delivered by the USPS.  DailyDeal USA owes me a total of $12.76.  I am hoping to have them resolve this by Monday.  If not, I will be contacting Amazon.com regarding this matter.",0
"Title: Believe the other reviews - but owner working on design
Review: This is an update to my previous review. I gave this product a less than stellar review because a flap in front did not stay down (I returned the product). The seller asked if I would reconsider the review because he was working on a redesign and if I amended the review he would send me the new design (presumedly for free). That never happened. So if this article is still available, I can't recommend it or the seller.<br /><br />This is a nice pair of underwear except the flap doesn't stay down and thus your junk is totally exposed. Some type of fastener would solve the problems. I gave this feedback to the company owner and he was responsive.

"Title: Worst DeMille book
Review: I am a huge Nelson DeMille fan, so it was with great anticipation that I sat down with this book, given to me as a gift. I hated everything about it. I don't recall despising the characters quite this much the first time around and I found the basic premise of the characters' relationship completely unbelievable. I was totally mystified at how much I didn't like this book, given that The Charm School, The Gold Coast and Plum Island are among my favorite novels.<br /><br />I believe I figured out what went wrong when I read the acknowledgments, in which DeMille thanks the chairman of the Hachette book group for convincing him (DeMille) that there was a sequel to The Gold Coast, even when DeMille had his doubts.

Review: I am sensitive to the microwave radiation used in cell phones and portable phones, like this Panasonic system. Microwaves, when really intense,<br />These Panasonic handsets put out more microwaves than any other phone I've used. They're using a more powerful microwave system called DECT, which I hadn't experienced before. DECT, I believe increases both range and clarity. However, the first time I placed the Panasonic portable phone within an inch of my ear for about 2 minutes, I got a slight but immediate headache that lasted 3 days. We had to return the phone system even though everything else about it is excellent. I want to emphasize that--in every other way, we really liked it.<br /><br />I can, without pain, use a cell phone, includin",0

Review: I went ahead and attached a photo of the ingredients in case anyone is curious like I was, since they did not do that in their own description or photos.<br /><br />This touts itself as a cleanser that you can use dry to remove makeup, or wet as a cleanser.  I tried both ways. To remove a full face of makeup, the best solution I've found is to apply this to a makeup cleansing cloth, then apply to the skin directly as if it was a makeup removing wipe.  Doing this, I found myself using a minimum of 5 pumps of product. I wouldn't be as bothered if the product didn't come about half way full, and no, the product did not spill in transit. You will need an actual cleanser to remove any residue on your skin after using this.<br /><br />Not worth t",0
"Title: Too Jarring & Strange
Review: This story isn't so much a story as a collection of shirt vignettes covering the loose storyline of Obinna - an at-home husband - and his slightly estranged friend, Eze. Having spent some time abroad as a single man, Eze is returning to visit Obinna in Nigeria, and the visit reminds Obinna just how unhappy he is being married to an unfaithful woman. Unfortunately for them, this is a world wherein men are oppressed under a global matriarchy rather than the reverse which is true in real life.<br /><br />That, unfortunately, is where I take the most issue with this story. Perhaps it's because I live in the deep south of the United States where I legitimately have to hear men complain as if women have too much control because we want equal righ",0
"Title: Don't buy the Kindle version.
Review: Terrible Kindle version.  You cannot see 90% of the hands that are discussed, rendering the book all but useless.  Even with the Kindle set to a large font size, the hands are still imperceptible because they have been transferred in an incredibly small font.  Oddly, about 10% of the hands or play situations are in the same size font as the text so they are readable.  Why this is not the case for the other 90% of the hands is a mystery.  There are also a few evident typos in the text.<br />The only thing that you will learn for this Kindle version is frustration.  Save your money (even if it is only $2!)",0

I've tried 3x over 3 days and still no luck. I make my money off my ideas, 2 days of which are on this damn stick! I transferred the files into logic pro and it said none of them even existed.

"Title: Just A Little........Disappointed.....
Review: I grew up on the music of Dusty Springfield and am still a huge fan of her recordings. While I never expect any other artist who chooses to do a ""songbook"" in honor of another artist to be the ""same"" as what the honored artist did with his/her rendition, I expect it to have at least some semblance of the original. The biggest disappointment on this endeavor by Ms. Lynne is her rendition of ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me"". A very sorry arrangement. While I am sure Ms. Lynne has her supporters, I would bet most of them are younger and don't even know who Dusty is. So, when you are going to take music from an era that belonged to the Baby Boomers, you need to ensure that it is appealing to that population. I have played this CD for a numbe",0

I feel I know their database and style better than most.<br /><br />Cook's, while not perfect, still remains probably the best all-around cooking magazine published today for the purpose of teaching people how to cook.

"Title: Misleading brightness rating
Review: I compared the lux rating detected by my light meter for a bulb from a high-end LED corn bulb manufacturer I trust (YujiLights), which has a known lumen rating of 3600 lumens. The YujiLight bulb measured 627 lux, while this bulb measured just 352 lux from the same distance.<br /><br />If I had to guess, the manufacturer of this bulb is giving the combined lumen rating for both bulbs. This is not how they should be labeled. Most buyers expect that the lumen rating is per-bulb.<br /><br />Also, the brand on the website is ""ZP,"" but on the box it's New Sunshine. This company makes another set of corncob LED bulbs, which also have a misleading lumen rating:<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GKDJPZN?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details",0

Review: I really like the KONUNUS Wooden Paper Making Mold. This has saved me from making one myself, that may have not turned out as well. I like to cut out tiny 'bricks' to glue onto my dollhouse kits. I've been saving egg cartons, but this has been a painstaking process. I also cannot use all the paper from the egg cartons as they are since very little of the material is flat. Now, I can make my own very quickly. I use an old blender, some water and PVA glue to make a pulp and squish it out flat onto the screen, then leave it to dry! I have much bigger pieces of textured paper I can simply cut with my paper cutter and get to work gluing them onto the outside walls of my dollhouse. This used to take me a lot of time, but this has really helped th",1

I bought this for my son for Christmas (Yes, I know it's too cold to use outside but planned on him playing with it in the kitchen or trying the whole rice idea).

"Title: A great product.  Many uses.
Review: I use these to keep warm at my kid's sporting events.  I also keep one in my car and take one when I go camping/hiking.  They are much tougher (and I think they work better) job than the plain mylar sheet.  When I was new to hiking, I made the mistake of wearing all cotton materials on a hike (not a good idea due to water retention).  I live in Western Washington and, big surprise, it rained on me.  I found myself at about 6000 feet, soaking wet, and freezing (very stupid on my part).  It took about 60 seconds from the time I wrapped up in one of these to get comfortably warm.  Another added plus is that it features eyelets so you can tie down if you need to.  It is very light, in fact, I have started carrying one with me in my laptop bag w",1

Usually when they make a change they will tell you on the packaging.  I’m going to have to try to find something else to use.  Don’t even know if I can finish the bottle as the smell bothers me.

Review: Although I have no complaints about the quality or look of these ties, I have never encountered such a short tie. Definitely not standard tie lengrh!

Next generation, MIM internals, no forged arm, China made from old dies, its just a sloppy tool from the get go.  Easily breaks with one hand pressure or pull.

Review: I wanted to like this book, I really did. Like many other books here, the reviews are misleading. About halfway through the book, the grammar and writing went downhill, making it difficult to stay with it. Writing became less coherent, as well, so it was difficult to follow the plot (I guess if the author was trying to simulate a confused mental state of the main character, he succeeded). Another issue is that is has no ending - just leaves you hanging. The idea is a good one and that is what kept me reading...wish it had an ending that made sense - that would have made it worth the effort.",0

"Title: It's Stevie Wonder,And The Title Isn't Lying Either
Review: When the first wave of CD's were hitting the record racks in 1986,Motown reissued the majority of its 60's and 70's catalog on a series of twofer CD's entitled ""2 All Time Great Classic Albums Series"". The audio quality of these CD's were nowhere close to what most people would consider remastered by today's standards. But these twofer CD's were not in print forever. And many of them are now highly prized collectors items as a result. One thing about Motown for sure is that their entire approach to music was built around hit singles. In fact these singles,which are now almost beyond iconic, are mini masterpieces in and of themselves. In Motown's case,however their full length albums could be one of two different things. They could either ta",1

It's much easier to handle, the reservoir holds more than enough water, but to my mind, the biggest thing is the customer service at Waterpik.  Each person I talked to was friendly, and very, very helpful.  I don't know when I've been treated so nicely.",0
"Title: For for your little hair stylist
Review: Kids can pretend to be a hair stylist.<br /><br />This is a very fun toy. They played with it for a while, and had a lot of fun. I liked that they could be creative with it.<br />We have many toys from this company. They make a lot of different products and we have generally been very happy with them. It worked well.<br /><br />This toy was durable. My kids can be a little rough with toys, but this continued to work just fine. We had no problems<br /><br />I feel like this is good for child development. It kept my children's interest. It would also make a nice gift.<br /><br />I would recommend it.",1
"Title: Family First Safety Always !
Review: From What I'm reading, the scopes could be better. You should buy extra strings and a cocking string.  You'll need string wax , bolts/arrows etc. Weather you get a soft or hard case for these Crossbows they are far from Complete and ready to go.  Amazon will take care of you purchase but can you look down your sights and not think this thing might just snap.  I can't trust either of these makers. I've owned Hoyts and Horton and passed them down to the boys without a shred of fear that it's was a mouse trap.",0
"Title: Really Helps Us with Our Aches & Pains
Review: This is a wonderful sports travel medicine kit. It's fabulous!!! There's the &#34;ChafeZone&#34; that prevents chafing from saddle sores, cycling chamois lubricant, sports bra, groin area, and swimsuit irritation. Both me and my husband are constantly fighting groin chafing from packing and hauling, then unpacking are belongings in a current move out of state. This has definitely helped us immensely.  Second, there's the &#34;BlisterZone&#34; that helps athletic and new shoes, high-heels and new shoes; along with skates, ski and hiking boots, ballet & dance shoes, and scuba and swimsuit abrasion.

"Title: Great bibs!
Review: This review is for Hafmall 6-Pack Baby Bandana Bibs for Drooling and Teething, Baby Bibs with Pacifier Holder Leashes for Boys and Girls Gift Set (Nautical). These bibs are by far the best bibs we have used! We love the size and shape of them and that there is a pacifier holder on it! They all have very cute patterns for a baby boy. The bandana style is also a lot cuter than a typical large bib. We have found we like these more than any other bibs we have. I think they are absorbent and practical. The price is also great at less than $10 for a pack of 6! We will be ordering more of these!",1
"Title: Not the best Stargate series, time to close the franchise
Review: I have always been a die hard Stargate fan, however, I have found that Stargate Universe is a big letdown. They have taken a great series of shows and created a whole new version of an unrelated series. It's a shame. As for the half season, I too would not purchase it. As with the Wild Wild West (way overpriced per season) I will wait for the full series. I got the WWW at $57 for the whole series, instead of paying $44 per season. I will do the same with other half season series as well. This new Stargate,  I would not buy at any price though, it's just not worth the ever diminishing space in my collection.<br /><br />Rod.",0
"Title: Failure
Review: It's times like this that make me not even want to watch Amazon Instant Video...the playback is horrible every single time. I pause the movie for at LEAST 30 minutes to an hour, go do something else, and when I come back, not even 10 minutes' worth of the movie has loaded. I got Amazon Prime thinking, &#34;hey, I'll be able to get free 2 day shipping AND be able to watch free movies!&#34; The 2 day shipping is great, but the videos are often sub-par and uninteresting, and in this case, the prequel isn't even offered for free! But somehow the sequel is??? Why am I paying $100 a year when I could be paying a fraction of that to watch a WAY BETTER selection on Netflix, and movies that ACTUALLY LOAD IN A TIMELY MANNER. I mean, the 2 day shippin",0
"Title: Very Cheaply Made
Review: *Note: this review is written by my fiance, who ordered the dress from my account*<br /><br />The dress pictured on Amazon is super cute, but what I received did not live up to the product listing. As you can see from my photos, the top part of the dress was missing the pretty floral pattern and instead had a single, tiny flower in a rather &#34;unfortunate&#34; location on the bust. I'm sure this is because of the way the fabric was cut when it was made, but no way could I wear that out in public! There was also sloppy stitching throughout - there were frayed stitches on one strap, stitching at the waistline was not even close to being in a straight line, etc. For the price I was not expecting super high quality, but I really can't believe",0
"Title: THE ABSOLUTE WORST OF THE WORST
Review: Stay as far away as you can from this company.  Their customer service is virtually nonexistent.  And, if you can somehow get through to their customer service, they are worthless.  I purchased a very expensive Legacy corkscrew from Wine Enthusiast.  The corkscrew was defective.  After many hours of trying to contact Wine Enthusiast, I got through to their so-called customer service (I call it customer disservice) and my defective corkscrew was replaced under warranty.  The replacement was defective.  Despite the fact that my corkscrew was still under warranty, Wine Enthusiast refused to repair or replace the second defective corkscrew.  It is my individual, personal, subjective opinion, belief, and interpretation that I was ripped off by t",0
"Title: Great value when purchased with the Wiimote and at the right price
Review: Good game but even better deal when combined with the Wiimote! I got this when it was $39.99 and couldn't pass that deal up since the Wiimote sells separately for the same price. The game itself is pretty entertaining and my 6 year old daughter has played it regularly over the 6 weeks. There are a lot of mini games that make specific use of the game pad. It's worth noting that most of the games are better played with multiple players such as during a &#34;family game night&#34; or as a party game sort of thing. All of the games were very easy for my 6 year old to pick up on but they were also challenging enough for everyone including my wife and me. You'll definitely want to have plenty of Wiimotes available so the &#34;free&#34; one includ",1
"Title: Fun and Durable Trike
Review: Bought this as a gift for our 16 month old granddaughter. It was a lot of fun watching her learn to scoot around. She really loves it and it provides lots of fun and coordination building exercise indoors and out. It's small enough she can ride in their apartment but stable enough to be ridden outdoors. The trike seems very durable and will hopefully last through a few more toddlers. It was a little tricky getting the wheels adjusted correctly so they rolled smoothly and easily, but we figured it out.",1
"Title: Easy to use, lightweight, and great string feed!  Battery life is very good!
Review: Easy to assemble and charged fairly quickly, Used to trim grass and weeds around lawn and it was easy to get the job done!  65 years old and have back trouble  but this trimmer was light enough that I got the job done!  Not made for or advertised for large jobs and tall weeds but grass clipping it does well!<br />  After a year I'm very pleased with this trimmer and ecstatic with the battery life!  I had an additional back surgery last July and so no yard work for a year.  I am liking the telescoping shaft and adjusting position of the trimming head is easy.  The string feed mechanism works well after pushing the button.  This spring I pulled out the trimmer and the battery fired right up and I was able to complete the trimming of my lawn a",1
"Title: Great for using with hubs
Review: I’ve tried this USB C Extension Cable with various adapters and hubs. It’s fantastic! So many hubs have incredibly short cords, and I don’t really like to have the weight of the hub dangling from the port on my laptop.<br /><br />This extension cable supports video transfer (60Hz refresh rate), data, and power charging. I used it with an HDMI to USB C adapter, my normal Apple power cable, and also an Anker USB C hub. It worked with all of them, and supported passthrough charging on the hub. But that depends on the hub. I use the extension cable with my 2017 MacBook Pro.<br /><br />The cable is braided, which I like for extra durability. But the braid is stiff, so it’s hard to coil the cable into a small circle if using it in a tight spot. I",1
"Title: Absolutely Horrendous
Review: Do not buy these. First, they only included three of the four styles (so 45 instead of 60 pieces). The three bags were just crammed into the small plastic case and was not even able to close. No way they could have put the fourth set in it. Second, because of the way they were put into the plastic and shoved in the case, they are all bent. They look nothing like the pictures at all. The coloring is off and looks awful and the quality is garbage. They are obviously very poorly made and are likely the ones that did not make the initial cut to be sold.",0
"Title: Delicious herb which can help lower high blood pressure
Review: I love hibiscus tea, and this Anthony's brand is fresh and delicious. I have previously also purchased other brands which I like, including Frontier and Dualspices. In my own experience, I can't tell the difference between them in terms of taste and quality of the herb, and all three brands are listed as organic. For that reason, when it is time for me to reorder hibiscus, the brand I choose usually depends on availability and current cost. I have also purchased many different organic, bulk teas from Anthony's over the years, and I have not been disappointed with any of them.<br /><br />I have included below, for any of my fellow, health-oriented consumers who might be interested, information from my own personal research on hibiscus.<br />",1
"Title: Gorgeous home detail
Review: Replacing floor registers is such an inexpensive upgrade that make a large, expensive-looking impact in a space!  The stylish art deco effect goes well and makes for an attractive conversation piece.<br /><br />The outer register is a heavy, brushed metal.  The articulating venting is made of a significantly inferior plastic and the vents only open in one direction (from side to side).  You cannot direct airflow away from a wall with these registers, but rather only adjust the amount of space through which air will pass.  For the price, however, they look absolutely exquisite and do their job.",1
"Title: Only 1/3 arrived correct
Review: The collars seem to be a decent quality and my only complaint about the collar itself is that I should have ordered one size bigger than I needed. However, the company that sends it is a mess. I got a call a couple days after placing my order from a man that had received a cat collar with my dogs info on it (after he had ordered a cat one; right collar, wrong tag). He was going to return it and request a new one.<br /><br />When my 3 finally did arrive, my pit mixes collar had the mans cats info on it. I get it, mistakes happen. I contacted the company to get it replaced and they never responded, but issued a return shipping label WHERE I HAD TO PAY POSTAGE. I tried to contact them multiple more times about it without any response before Am",0
"Title: Doesn’t last
Review: We bought this to use with our infant on a trip and it worked well for the seven days that we were gone. However once we got back, we tried using it about a week later and and the touch strip for the lights no longer worked. About a week later we pulled it out again for another overnight trip, and this time it was dead, and would not turn on even after being charged overnight.  I had been excited about this noise machine after our first trip because it is a nice size and design, but I guess it’s terrible quality because it stopped working after less than a week and a half of actual usage.",0

This wreath is the perfect size for my glass door under my arch way outside. I have looked everywhere for the right wreath an kept coming up short. But look no further the creators work speaks volumes and it's worth every penny.<br />Easy to assembly for the monograham as instructed. I am more that satisfied with this purchase.

Review: The Case of the Diabolical Decadence, the last book in the gossip cozy mystery series, is an absorbing, thrilling, interesting cozy mystery.  I couldn't begin to figure out who the murderer could be. This book is full of surprises that took a lot of twists and turns throwing me off course as soon as I had  an inkling as to who could have done it.<br /><br />I enjoyed every page and couldn't put it down.  I felt a little sad that it's the end of this series but Rosie A.

"Title: NOT GOOD!!! Third Dayton motor in 3 years!!
Review: Lasted just over a year. Can't find any warranty information, but I'm sure if there was a warranty it would only be for a year anyways just like the original one that came on the outdoor wood burner. All I can say is Dayton motors are junk!! The only reason I ordered the last one on amazon is it was $60 cheaper compared to the heating and cooling place that the wood burner came from. They also said they have been disappointed with the Dayton motors and said they should even last more than a couple years, but people have had to keep replacing them that they sold the wood burners to. All I can say is the first sign of noise coming from the blower motor, you best send it back if it's under warranty still.",0
"Title: Great little set.....
Review: I use these in my shop as a mechanic.  I've only used them a couple of times, but thus far I'm very happy with them.... and I am picky when it comes to tool quality.<br /><br />The only thing that is difficult (and I understand that this can't really be helped... It is just the size of these bits) is getting the bits in and out of the holder sometimes.  I would recommend that you keep the small rubber band that is wrapped around the set so that the bits don't fall out freely when you are trying to take the cap on and off.<br /><br />All in all... I would recommend the set.  I rarely ever give something a 5 star review.",1
"Title: Perfect for daily exfoliation
Review: I had actually never heard of these until recently when I saw these on a YouTubers skincare vid. The texture reminds me of styrofoam when dry. It gets soft when dampened and doesn't feel rough on the skin at all. I use this to remove my makeup and sunscreen daily and it offers a light exfoliation. I think I might need to avoid scrubbing the sides of my nose too much but other than that I like using it most days. The string through it is convenient to hang it up after wringing it out to dry. I imagine the sponge lasts quite some time so Ill probably give the others to my friends and family to try. Pretty inexpensive and I'd recommend for light exfoliation.",1
"Title: YUM! What more is there?
Review: I love swiss chocolates and these are great! Their chocolate isn't as sweet as ours. I generally prefer dark chocolate, skip milk chocolate and avoid white chocolate because it's too sweet. However in the interest of scientific research (sounds better than pigged out) I have tried all the various types of chocolates available in this collection. The white chocolate wasn't as sicky sweet as the american version -- it was perfectly acceptabl<br />e and I didn't mind eating it at all.<br /><br />The milk chocolate, the one I was most familiar with and I loved that one.

"Title: Not a good purchase
Review: The screen itself seems to be good quality. It fit into my aluminum casing perfectly. The issue is the two connectors that connect to my mother board. Both wires are the wrong size making the screen unusable. I know this is my fault, but I did not realize the company is in China, so shipping takes a long time and the cost to send the product back is cost prohibitive. I guess as far as mistakes go this is relatively  small, but I wish I would have read a review like this before I bought the screen and kept my 30 dollars.",0

Review: This is a great ceramic waver for hair. It is fairly easy to use, but it took me almost an hour to do my entire head of hair (despite the fact that this has a larger plate for more hair at a time than other curler/wavers. This fits well in my hand (ergonomically easy) and it was easy to maneuver. Not sure how often I will be using this (I typically prefer my hair on the straight side) but I will use it for special occasions since it seems so tedious to go section by section. This would be easy to use on someone else in lieu of doing my own hair. Might ask a friend to help me with mine next time for sure.",1
"Title: A Big Disappointment
Review: The characterization and plot of this story are so different from the first two miniseries that it can hardly be called a sequal!  I'm not a purist, but I think that a screenplay should at least be faithful to the spirit and vision of a novel/series, and this one fails miserably.  The characters have the same faces, but their personalities have changed.  They have been time warped from the late 1800's to 1914, and their behavior is unfaithful to their former portrayals.  Take some advice--watch the last scene of ""The Sequal"", sigh happily, and forget you ever heard about this one.",0

Review: I am a typist and I sit in an office chair for 8 or more hours per day.  I have tried other cushions in the past, some much more expensive than this and they have all failed.  I love the fabric on this cushion it is super soft, however, the bottom has anti-slip material so it does not shift around in your seat.  It conforms to you individual shape almost immediately upon sitting on it.  I have super bad posture after having just had twins and my abdominal muscles being shot right now, so I really needed some help with making me sit upright and not slouch back, this cushion does exactly that.

I don't have a camera on my monitor and now am only using this microphone solely for Cortana.  First the set-up was indeed very simple.  Plug it in and it is immediately ready to use.  My computer recognized it right away and there was no further set up.  After the additional set-up of Cortana on my computer this CMTECK microphone has worked flawlessly.

Review: Alright, it’s not inexpensive, but this light is really cool.  Includes a bulb and holder.  Has a very strong wood smell that dissipates over time (not an issue to me, but may be for sensitive noses).  Designed to mount against a wall, not hung from the ceiling since only one side lights up.  You could do two back-to-back for a truly unique ceiling lamp.  Overall, my son loves it and uses the lamp as a reading light over his bed.  I also used a few Mario themed props to hide the bulb holder that protrudes from the top as other have mentioned.

Review: I recently started out in the CD world to save money and was very excited to try a new type. I'd heard mixed reviews of Alva (one half loves them, one half hates them) but was willing to give it a shot. In our case, SO not worth the risk. Both diapers we bought delaminated in a week. I treated them exactly the same as I treat my more expensive cloth that I've had for about 6 months and still works great, so this was super disappointing. The one pro I can say is that the inserts are super fluffy and absorbent. At least I now have two relatively inexpensive swim diapers. I have heard that some batches are better than others and some people have had their Alvas for 5+ years, so buy at your own risk.",0

Also, the battery wears out in about 2 days even if I took it out when I was finished each time. Save yourself some $$ and buy a .99 cent emory board!",0
"Title: Good Choice for a 32"" LED TV
Review: This is a very nice price for an excellent 32&#34; LED TV. Because of its smaller screen size, the Vivid Picture Setting looks great, in my opinion.<br /><br />This TV only has 2 HDMI ports, but you can of course buy an HDMI switch box with remote control if you need more HDMI ports.<br /><br />The sound is OK, but not spectacular, of course. There are RCA audio ports to go out to a sound bar or speaker, and Digital Audio Out, if desired.<br /><br />I am very happy with the picture quality, the colors, the brightness, and the black levels.<br /><br />This D32f-E1 is the 2017 model from the Vizio D Series line.

But, as I was listening to the book, I was astounded that Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner's marriage was included. In a book about spouses murdering instead of divorcing! I find it despicable that the author was saying that not only was Natalie Wood murdered, but that Robert Wagner was the murderer!

"Title: Fast Shipping, Right Label ... WRONG ITEM
Review: Just got off the phone with Amazon to let them know this company has a QA/QC control issue. The item in the picture posted here for sale online is the right item. And the bag that Startech sent me had the cable labeled as the one I wanted on the outside of their plastic bag. But upon opening said bag, I immediately noticed two things: 1) the cable was incredibly short - maybe 2-3 ft long at most, and 2) the USB end was actually a mini-USB (like that used for some older phones or electronics like the Logitech Harmony remotes and the PS-3), instead of the much thinner micro-USB required for the PS-4 controller. Additionally, instead of a straight micro USB ending as pictured, the mini USB ending sent had a right angled ending. I don't underst",0
"Title: Like the PS4 controllers, designed for drift
Review: I owned my PS4 for 5 years and went through about 8 controllers.  The reason is that every single time, without fail, a new controller would start displaying stick drift after a period of time.  Generally, it was around 6-8 months after I'd bought the controller.<br /><br />If I kept it, the drift would constantly get worse and worse to the point where the controller was unusable.<br /><br />So, I'd constantly have to fork out for a new PS4 controller, once or twice a year.<br /><br />These new dual shock 2 controllers have great features and vast improvements on existing ones.<br /><br />But, still, after 6 months with my new PS5, the controller it came with had inevitably developed the stick drift.<br /><br />Frequently, it led to the cur",0
"Title: Very good screws, reasonable price, be aware of the SS alloy's iron content.
Review: I've obtained several different sizes and types of screws from this seller, and the quality has been consistent for all I've received and used. (I've had the option to post a review for each type or size I've received, so you may see a review from me more than once for a particular type of screw.) For all of the screws, I've found the heads, threads and tips are precisely made, and true to advertised size. These are a good choice for multiple projects. I found the metal screws work just as well in soft steel, aluminum and wood, without any issues. As some other reviewers also mention, the screws do have a higher iron content than some other SS alloy hardware, so are not necessarily best for some use cases or environments. However the 304 SS",1
"Title: Very Happy!
Review: I'm very happy with the myCharge Portable Charger Power Bank because it charges all my devices very quickly. The housing on the power bank in thick and strong. I would trust this bank for transport in a purse, backpack or bag because it's solid and durable. I take this to work with me, as I work at a hospital and I'm sometimes too tired between shifts to fully charge my cell phone, which I also use at work. I carry this in my pocket of my scrubs, and despite all my moving about, it hasn't had a scratch. This is a great power bank for busy people! I hope you found my review helpful, and kindly will click the button below. Have a blessed day!",1
"Title: UPDATES:  Used to be a great product; not anymore!  Cheapened up and RUINED!
Review: 3rd update:  July 2016:  Thought after a year, I'd try these again, hoping they were more like they were when I first started buying them.  Wrong!  If anything, they're worse.  They just keep filling the bags with more junk, less good stuff, but the price never goes down to reflect that.  Disappointed again, and now lowering my rating to one star!<br /><br />2nd UPDATE: 7/10/15:  I'm done with these!!  The last 20+ bags I've gotten (yes, I used to buy ALOT of these), no matter the price or the seller, are 90% the small, light-weight pcs that I believe must be pig skin.  VERY FEW &#34;real&#34; rawhides.  I have 2 LARGE dogs, and they gobble those puffy pcs, barely chewing them.  What started out as excellent dog treats has been ruined by fi",0

"Title: Great splint
Review: Bought this splint after I was diagnosed w/carpal tunnel & was told to sleep in a splint at night. I ordered this one & was very pleasantly surprised how easy it was to put on by yourself & it is so comfortable. The cushiony beanbag feeling padding on the palm is so soft while keeping you wrist & palm from bending. There is a removable metal bar that holds the wrist in place that you can take out for washing. The 3 Velcro strips are sticky but cut in such a way that the Velcro doesn’t stick to blankets or sheets. My joints hurt so much less now that I am wearing the splint at night. Highly recommend!",1
"Title: Weak, small & generally useless
Review: I bought this to tote groceries the short distance from the car into the kitchen (maybe 40 - 50 feet, no stairs).  The packaging didn't indicate a weight limit but did say cart was sturdy or words to that effect.  Upon first use I found it to be flimsy & almost too small to be of use.  Small plastic wheels didn't roll over front door's threshold & had I to pick it up.  After another two or three uses, the handle came out of the base as I unfolded it to use.  I never could get it back in right and just decided to return it.  The picture on the packaging shows some sports equipment (i.e., soccer ball, basketball, etc.)in cart, but I wouldn't recommend using it for that.  It is disappointingly small, fragile and awkward.<br /><br />I subsequen",0
"Title: Does the job
Review: Dishwasher arrived yesterday.<br /><br />I immediately hooked it up, loaded it up, and sent it on its maiden wash cycle.<br /><br />I ran the normal wash cycle.  Takes 1:45.  Dishes were clean, and DRY!  I find it really annoying when I have to dry my stuff after it's done washing in the dishwasher.  There was a little water in the normally expected places such as the nooks of my storage containers, but that's to be expected.  But even the bottoms of my cups and mugs where water will tend to pool were dry.<br /><br />The installation was really easy, and I like the quick release system that connects to the faucet.<br /><br />I'll post an updated review after some time, but my initial impression of this machine is, this was a good buy.",1

My on desktop, which I had Norton Anti-virus, it didn't go so well so I had to reinstall it.  And then it all happened.<br /><br />My desktop is a few years old and Norton 360 would bog down everything.  It constantly would give me the dreaded ""red X"" on the icon in the tool bar.  It was constantly trying to back up my files even when I went in and disabled this feature.  It also slowed down my internet connection.  I tried disabling the Internet transaction security but everytime I went onto the web it was enabled.  Finally I just uninstalled the whole thing.  I loved the plain Norton Anti-v",0
"Title: Undeniably convenient
Review: These disposable food containers are undeniably useful.  You get 200 of them in a huge box, and each one is basically the size of a side-dish takeout container from a restaurant.  The best part is that when you're done with them they can go right in the recycling.  This is a great option to bring to restaurants with you if you are worried about brining home leftovers in non-recyclable packaging.  As long as you are gentle with them you can wash and reuse, so they don't have to go straight to the recycling, either.  I have found these to be very convenient.",1

The drawers are just the size for what I want, and unlike the plastic see through drawers, these drawers slide out easily on roller barring and close without binding.<br />WELL WORTH THE MONEY and you can have four drawers that you can put your things in without them getting buried under everything else you put in the drawer.<br />UPDATE:  I had a problem with ONE of the handles and contacted seller, they sent me FOUR new handles to correct the problem.<br />OUTSTANDING service",1
"Title: Works great!
Review: Funky but effective. Looks and wears like a water skiing vest. Four mesh pockets hold plastic inserts full of some kind of weird chemical which you either submerge in ice water or put in your freezer for 45 minutes. For whatever reason they don't weep condensation, and they do feel very agreeably cool. I had been looking at Camelbak hydration packs and wondering if I could freeze one and wear it on my chest. Then I found this item on Amazon. It's a bit small, XXL when I could use an XXXL size, but between the velcro straps on the shoulders and side it fits. Very interested in this product to beat the summer heat, and I believe it will work just fine. Surprised and impressed. Comes with a very nice insulated carrying bag.<br />Good quality m",1

Review: The first thing you should know before using these great Avery T-shirt Transfers for Inkjet Printers, is that the results you get can be perfect, when you know how to apply these like a pro! I've used these transfer sheets for years, after being in the T-shirt printing business many years ago, and they are great for beautiful personalized items. Before you begin, you should know that it's helpful to have a photo, art or printing program that will reverse your image, called mirror image or flip image. You have to print the image in reverse or flipped to come out correctly on your shirt or other cotton item you are printing on. Once you have a program to flip your photo or art on, it is also important to know that making your picture as brigh",1
"Title: Great replacement for water
Review: I purchased this to use in protein powder shakes.  It has a mild coconut flavor which adds a little extra something to the protein powder I use after my workouts, especially the banana flavor.  I like to switch up the liquids in the shake switching between soy milk, almond milk and coconut water just to add a little variety and it works out perfectly.  The protein powder doesn't taste as good if you use it with plain water, though that does not add any calories.  The coconut water doesn't add as much calories as the different milks, so that is good too.",1

Review: These vitamin D gummies are easy to chew, they taste great, and they keep my levels high enough. For some reason my body doesn't maintain vitamin D levels on its own even though I live in the south and get a lot of sunlight. The last time I had it tested, my level was 1 and should have been above 13 to be considered ""low,"" so I was ""critically low."" After repeated tests over the course of 2 years, my doctor said I would need to supplement forever. I started off with RX vitamin D and then weaned to daily supplements. My levels are better and I am not so exhausted all the time. I was retested last week and have maintained my levels using these gummies and as a bonus, I don't have to swallow a horse pill!",1
"Title: Luna - Tracy I Love You (EP)
Review: This is an out of print, and very rare EP from Australia, containing the hit single ""Tracy I Love You,"" along with five other live tracks that could can not have been heard anywhere else at the time, though several of the tracks can now be heard on the live Night Nurse bootlegs.  Never the less, during these years, this gave fans the chance to hear what Luna sounded like live, a dream for most of us, as Luna's live adventures were rather limited.  This disc was produced in a slim line jewel box, with a front insert only, there was never a rear insert issued.  It's a great addition to your collection, though selling for around $70 US, this is a rather pricey EP to say the least.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler",1
"Title: heartwarming doesn't quite cover it.
Review: There are so many ""heartwarmings"" thrown around on Amazon all the time to describe books that are kind of cute. I hate to use that word to describe this book because in some ways it just seems degrading. This book does warm the heart. You can't help it. I loved the POV for this book and really thought it worked well. I couldn't imagine it being written any other way. This book is fun from the very first line and doesn't ever let you down as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Possibly my favorite thing about this book is that the author makes the dog such a part of the story. I hate it when you pick up a book with an animal or something else on the cover and that subject is barely touched upon. This book really keeps the promise that the cover ma",1

In my photo I have split pea soup frozen in my normal freezer. I put some vegetable soup in the freezer for a day and a half now. Not one bit of freeze on it. Just liquid cooked soup.<br /><br />I followed all instructions. Left it upright a day. Then turned it to 4 for 2 more days.

Review: Keeping mind, the price and the electrical components this is a great little guitar.  I have fun playing it.<br /><br />I can definitely tell the difference in sound quality when compared to other guitars I own.  This guitar didn't cost what those guitars cost, and it didn't claim to be an equivalent.  I really like it for what it is.<br /><br />The neck was under bowed when I got the guitar.  A quick adjustment and it was back in specs and ready to play.<br /><br />The big surprise for me is the Sawtooth amp that came with it.  For a small practice amp, it works very well.<br /><br />This guitar should work well for a beginner because you are not overwhelmed with too many sound adjustments.<br /><br />GoDPS Music was very responsive to the",1

Review: The version sold here has _not_ been translated into English. The game does not work on my Win7 machine, even with the language packs installed. I also tried it on an old WinXP laptop. Same issues.<br /><br />I could be wrong, but I don't think I am. All the installation screens render the text as gibberish (not Japanese gibberish, Gibbertian gibberish).

"Title: Abominable!!
Review: [[VIDEOID:885c6b38945b8541712576b0826b5b63]] These reeds don't work properly due to many flaws in design and craftsmanship.<br /><br />The tips of these reeds were almost all torn and clamped (blunt cutter).  The measurements were generally off.  The vamp had jagged edges and was not smooth (as it should be). The slope of the vamp was uneven with pits and tears.<br /><br />The underside of the reed was pitted and had cross-cut damage. It would not lie flat against the mouthpiece.<br /><br />These reeds were packaged with a silica desiccant pack. I suspect the reason they include desiccants is because the reeds were not properly cured, drained and dried prior to manufacture, and that's likely why these reeds are so damaged...

Review: I really enjoyed this adventure of Bonnie at college in the big city! Katie Lou is such an amazing friend who wisely managed her lottery winnings and assured her friend she'd never let her leave her education behind despite losing some of her financial aid. Not long after that happened, one of her professors was murdered in his office. Along with her police officer friend James, Bonnie wanted to unravel this mystery and try to find a job, both of which happened when the ending was wrapped up. I like how those two sleuth together. Even Officer Knox is getting a little more tolerant and actually seemed a little proud of how Bonnie helped in the last case.<br /><br />I hadn't suspected who the killer was until a cleverly planted clue showed up",1

If you see the brass and plastic and o-rings used in every one of these tiny cartridges it's an environmental buster too!! Throwing these away after a few hours used it was totally irresponsible they should have made these refillable with a standard butane refill.

Review: Soft as butter- I love these are thin, lightweight and only soften more with wash/wear. Made of a “blanket” material vs. “stuffed animal” content they’re far easier to wash with a laundry load and have back quickly without compromising integrity! It’s like washing a burp cloth- it’s just that simple..!!<br /><br />A threaded face, fabric covered head, corner knots and cleverly placed tucked stitching creates a character out of nothing ie, mane, ears, trunk, etc. Doing this removes angst that come with a stuffed option. These might show tatter over time as threads wear thin.. but they won’t lose limbs or real content- and trust me, as kids attach.. it matters!!<br /><br />Small and size these easily fit into diaper bag or car seat without ta",1

"Title: Welcome to Erana!
Review: Alexandra Butcher has a powerful and interesting voice that is sure to delight all lovers of fantasy. I love the concept of a fantasy world in which Magic has been outlawed, the setting creates the impression of a kind of transition period in history between fanciful youth and totalitarian adulthood.<br /><br />There is a certain element of eroticism to Butcher's work, but I wouldn't go so far as to call this erotic literature. Romance, desire, and fulfillment are major themes that she deals with, as is the frustration of having these basic human needs denied. But these themes are presented with eloquence and tact--and they are worthy themes to drive a narrative.<br /><br />Butcher's writing is clean and professional. These are tales that w",1

Review: This is a selection of 88 hymns played on the piano by a talented young artist, Susan Beisner. All these hymns appear in the Trinity Hymnal (Revised Ed.,1990) which is commonly used in the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC). Many of these hymns also occur in other major hymnals, such as The Hymnal for Worship and Celebration (1986). Each hymn in this set is played through the same number of times that there are verses in the Trinity Hymnal.<br /><br /> This collection would be helpful for those who love to sing hymns individually or as a family.

"Title: great budget alternative to the Graco 4ever
Review: A few months ago, we got a [[ASIN:B00Y286AHS Graco 4ever All-in-One Car Seat]]. Between our two kids (5 and 1.5), two cars, and four local grandparents, we'd been through a lot of car seats, but the Graco 4ever was my favorite. The Safety 1st Grow and Go has many of the same features but - at just half the price of the Graco - will be a much better value for many families.<br /><br />Like the Graco 4ever, the Safety 1st Grow and Go is designed to transition from newborn to 100 pounds.

Review: Pumpkin seeds have been used to strengthen weak bladders and urinary tracks, since humanity discovered how to eat a pumpkin. Of course, your best bet is to eat the whole seed, not this extracted oil. The seed has lots of fiber, phytonutrients, zinc and magnesium. Nevertheless, whatever is in pumpkin seeds that heals the urinary track, and prostate, is present in the oil as well.  I have a neighbor who has serious problems with his urinary track, to the point where he was barely able to urinate. He was recommended to eat lots of pumpkin and sunflower seeds, and the problem went away. I haven't had any problems either since taking the seeds.

Review: The pictures I uploaded of a leather chair I got here on Amazon shows how the conditioner leaves the leather with a low shine, and it is not slippery after application.  The conditioner does have a slight odd odor but seems to go away after an hour. The company box does say it has a subtle scent. If I was to cover my car seats with this product a simple spray of air freshener would fix it. I live in a dry area and using this conditioner should keep the leather from cracking especially during winter months.  I also notice when I touch the leather it feels softer.

The first screw was beginning to snug because it's a half-inch longer, and the head twisted right off! Power Pro Premium they are NOT. One thing that IS larger is the head.

"Title: Not Finishing This Loser
Review: I am not halfway into this book, but decided I'd wasted enough time on it when one of the characters found a &#34;philodendron&#34; growing wild in the Smokey Mountain woodlands.  It's a shame to choose a setting as awesome as the East Tennessee mountains and then write about it with such dullness and lack of feeling.  The male characters are mostly caricatures of mean, ignorant hillbillies, and all the characters are cardboard.  The author tells far too much of the tale rather than letting the characters tell it.  The dialogue is stiff.  The editing is atrocious.  Sorry I can't find anything to like about this book except the setting. I must say I am surprised that it got so many favorable reviews.",0

I chose Snoot because it had high rates from consumers. The bottles are sturdy, didn't leak in my purse once, has fine spray but powerful spray, and doesn't drip. I've recommended them to many friends. But I have something to add. One of our spray pumps broke.

Everyone in the house is an adult now, and I correctly assumed that it is intended for families with younger children so I was not convinced that it would be a good fit for my family. That also is correct, and that's my fault. That said, this is a new devotional designed to get the family engaged and spending time together.<br /><br />This devotional is a little different than some of the others I have seen. It does more than provide a Scripture passage, offer a discussion, pose a few questions and then finish with a time of prayer. All of those are standard fare for devotionals, including this one. What this one adds, how",1
"Title: Cost-Effective Starter Kit for At-Home Gel Nails
Review: This kit is the most basic starter kit for the Red Carpet gel nails. It has everything you need to get started, except for colors. Be sure to purchase a color or colors as well so you have everything you need. The lamp works great and all products arrived in mint condition and worked as described. Color usually stays on for 2 weeks, if you don't pick at your nails.<br /><br />I previously purchased a larger kit that I liked more than this kit (here): Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 LED Gel Nail Polish Kit Soak Off Starter Package https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00662Z24A/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_MsVmFbXQFB0CA<br /><br />The reason I liked it more is because that kit came with more products and the lamp feels sturdier: 1 color, nail files and “erase” tube (",1
"Title: Who Made This???????
Review: First off, I gave it a one star, because they make you.  I would have been glad to give it a zero or a negative.  I am glad I didn't purchase this, it was a gift.  But I do feel that my mom got ripped off!  She purchased it for us because this is a tea drinking household, I usually make a gallon a day.  I was able to use it for a whole whopping week.  It does make a massive mess UNLESS you do line up it ""to a T"".  Once I figured out where my ""T"" was, I didn't leak anymore out off my pitcher unless the slightest movement on the counter was made and not by touching the pitcher.  I guess it would vibrate it out of place.  Ok, so no more kitchen action while that stupid thing was running.  So now that I have learned the odd angle my pitcher nee",0
"Title: Beautiful instrument.  Quality Craftsmanship.
Review: I love this UBass!  I have several full size electric basses and a full size acoustic bass, but I wanted something I could travel with and plink around with in bed or in my recliner.  I have songs come into my head all the time and just want to figure out the fingering.  This UBass helps me satisfy my urge  to play anywhere.  I've played several plugged and unplugged duets with my cello playing wife for for a few gigs.  It's softer unplugged, but you can still get a good sound.  Plugged into an amp, it sounds just like an upright bass.  Great for Stray Cats stuff.<br />  The look:  I got the zebra wood version and it is immaculately made.  Even the inside is beautiful.  This is not a slapped together, factory-made toy.  It is a genuine work",1
"Title: I have finally found the love of my life
Review: After 4 different product trials for car diffusers, I have finally found the love of my life!!<br /><br />This baby delivers all the goods.  Easy to use, no extra items to refill (long tubular sponges), no complicated setup, and it will not ruin/melt your interior (essential oils are powerful and will cut through the material surround your charging port/cigarette lighter).<br /><br />This has settings just as your indoor diffuser.  High or Low.  Timed.  Very pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and will be purchasing them for my friends and family.",1
"Title: Season 5 of Night Court is As Good As it Gets
Review: Season 5 of Night Court is arguably one of the two best seasons.  The cast is still happy, the faces are familiar and the zaniness continues.  Harry Stone (Harry Anderson), presides over Manhattan's Court de la Nuit.  With Dan Fielding and Christine Stone (the Yin and Yang of law), Bull, Roz and Mac in the wings, the one liners fly like lies from a politicians mouth.<br /><br />Only Season 4, in my opinion, had as much going for it as does Season 5.  Roz having taken over for Selma (Selma Diamond who died during Night Court's second season), the courtroom is safe.  Roz' dry sense of humor added that jen ne se quoi to the antics of the others.  Again, I feel this was taken to aid Jasmine Guy in [[ASIN:B00GT2TEPU Dead Like Me]] as she played ",1

"Title: I really wanted to like it. The more I read
Review: If you know nothing about computers, the history of the Internet, or how black hats work; this may be entertaining.  However, if you know anything about those things you will find this to be very frustrating. The author writes as if his readers are Luddites with no technical knowledge at all.  While reading, I got the feeling that he was taking an interesting subject and trying to &#34;hype it up&#34; into an over the top spy drama instead of just writing about what actually happened from a historical perspective.<br /><br />Since I am an IT professional, I had high hopes when I  stumbled upon a book written by a BBC reporter about subject matter of which I am familiar.  I really wanted to like it.  The more I read, the more I was frustrate",0
"Title: The Amazing Criswell Predicts!!!
Review: I was binging on '50s silly sci fi movies, having watched a MysteryScience3000 offering on a local TV affiliate (same channel that serially airs old LowRents Welk gawdawful TV shows), and watched ED WOOD [[ASIN:B0000VD04M Ed Wood (Special Edition)]] and PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE (subtitle:  GRAVE ROBBERS FROM OUTER SPACE) [[ASIN:6305760403 Plan 9 From Outer Space]] again after this album came in, and I caught onto the same vibe in both this MARKED FOR DEATH Lp and Criswell's narration about Solaranite &#34;doomsday bomb&#34; that will explode sunlight and the Universe....  Jack Van Impe also picks up on Criswell's alliteration presentation style on this Lp.<br /><br />About the playback on this Lp:  Total running time is 39:25; Side one cuts ",1
"Title: The Extremist Constitution
Review: The publisher is not forthright with the fact this pamplet promotes the constitutional interpretations of<br />W. Cleon Skousen, a fringe-mormon who taught the posse comitatus concept that sheriffs are the highest law in the land.<br /><br />Followers of this interpretation believe county sheriffs have authority over the Federal government.  This pamplet is popular with anti-government extremist groups and is the one carried by Ammon and Ryan Bundy during their armed takeover of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.<br /><br />Constitutionalist sheriffs who believe they have law authority over the Federal Government also carry this particular pamplet.<br /><br />This item is printed at the &#34;National Center for Constitutional Studies&#3",0

"Title: Worst Purchase I've made this year
Review: First off, it has glue. WHY?? they would put glue on a static cling window film is beyond me, but there IS and it makes installing it extremely difficult. IF you manage to get it on the window without fingerprints because there's GLUE on it...good luck getting any air bubbles out. The glue prevents them from sliding out; when  you press harder it mars the finish so it's no longer 'pristine'.<br /><br />Considering I've done my entire house in privacy film except the ONE window I wanted to leave an outside view, I KNOW how to install window film. This abomination doesn't qualify as window film, it's a window sticker, and good luck getting air bubbles out around the glue they decided to put on this junk, or having a 'naked glass' appearance.<",0
"Title: I love the set-up of this planner
Review: I love the set-up of this planner. I needed a planner for work that would well work. It is simple. The months are on 2 pages and arranged like you would see if any are familiar with the hobonichi planner system. The months are all together (July 2017-December 2018). The other half of the planner is the week on one page. The paper quality I would say is adequate. The planner is currently at work so I can't take pictures to demonstrate shadowing or bleedthrough. so I can hope I can do an update for that later on. There is a clear plastic cover for the front and back of the planner for added protection. The back cover has a folder with a sticker page that I tore out and placed in it. The planner would have dropped down to 3 stars if not for th",1

Review: I have the VHS and the Blue Ray is far superior. It's great for grand children. Our 3 and half year old granddaughter left her week long stay singing Yellow Submarine and All Together now.<br /><br />Included with the disc are 16cm by 12cm transparencies of the carton characterizations of the four Beatles.  Also included is a 16cm by 12cm sheet of stickers of the individual Beatles, the Glove, Jeremy Hillary Boob, the yellow submarine, LOVE, The Blue Meany, and a group shot of the Beatles.<br /><br />There's a booklet (16cm by 12cm) with the story and pictures of the making of the movie.<br /><br />It's great DVD to have if you are  Beatle fan and/or grand parent.",1
"Title: Wrong Upstream Oxygen Sensor for VW Jetta
Review: This was my second order for a oxygen sensor for my VW Jetta. I needed the upstream one but this is not for my 2001. So yet again I had to send it back to Amazon. I must say again that they (Amazon) was excellent in regards to me having to return the product without any hassels. Just to note if you happen to need the upstream and you have a 2001 VW Jetta GLS AVH the Bosch sensor you will need is #17085. I had to finally call Bosch directly to get this part number. I didnt order it from another seller here because they didnt seem to be able to answer my question so I went else where E*** and was able to get one for $70.00 :0)...so happy about that!!!",0
"Title: Cheap frame, TERRIBLE putty.
Review: I don't know why nobody else had this problem, but the putty was impossible to work with! I kneaded it for at least ten minutes, and it was still stiff, like the texture of memory foam. We pressed the baby's foot down as hard as we dared, and it left no imprint at all! I kneaded the crap again for another five minutes, and it still wasn't soft enough to take an imprint. I tried pushing my knuckle into it as hard as I could, and it still bounced right back up -- left no print at all!  We'll keep the frame (even though it arrived broken, as others have said), but I'll get some clay or plaster for the print. That putty is impossible.",0
"Title: Smaller than Average Notebook.
Review: This isn't a regular sized sketch notebook. It's smaller, which I love! It makes it easier to carry around. It fits easily inside my purse, or more often, diaper bag. The pages are thick, and are also perforated for easy removal. The back cover is *super* thick, so I don't have to hold anything under the notebook in order to practice drawing. There's a 2 sided pocket &#34;divider&#34; in the front of the notebook, so I can hold little slips of ideas in there.<br /><br />I'm a beginner in the drawing area, but I love this notebook. I imagine I'll be getting more of them through the years!",1
"Title: Did not purchase for drawing, will not work for me.
Review: I did nit buy this fir drawing, I bought it as a way to store my extra large cutting mat (for sewing) so that it remains flat.  The problem lies with the clips. For one thing, the edge of the clips that would be in vontact with the mat is very sharp.  I feel that they would permanently damage the mat wherever they clip onto.  Secondly,  there are 3 little screws on each clip that protrude from the top of them that are quite sharp.  I cut my finger on ine when getying the clipboard out if the package.  I must say, tgese clips are rather odd too.  I was expecting something similar to a classic office clipboard, but I've never seen any like these before.  I have no experience with drawing clipboards, maybe this is what they're all like.  When ",0
"Title: An Excellent Language Tool
Review: I've owned this program for several months now and have enjoyed it immensely. It's fun and easy to use. My method is of course to keep a Russian/English dictionary handy to help learn new vocabulary.<br /><br />I feel that many of the other reviews were unfairly critical of the program. With regard to common greetings and phrases, there are many typical sources that offer this (and little more). Rosetta Stone is for those individuals who already have the phrase book who are wanting to take the next step in their language development.<br /><br />Additionally, this tool can't overcome grandiose expectations and poor study habits. If you expect to learn Russian by using this once a week, forget it. Our brains know where our priorities lie base",1
"Title: Love it!
Review: So much nicer than the stand that comes with my tv! The reason I need this is ridiculous but my dogs love to stand up in front of the tv when I'm watching tv in bed and now I put my tv up higher so I don't miss anything when they stand up! I have it set up on it's highest adjustment and I was afraid it'd make my tv unstable but it still sits there really nicely and doesn't wobble at all! I think the heavy base is to thank for that.<br /><br />What I LOVE: the ability for it to be adjusted to whatever height you want!<br />What I do NOT love: nothing! I love it all! Assembly took slightly longer than I wanted at the end when it came to line the tv up and attach it to the stand but the problem you have there is this is a universal stand and e",1
"Title: Soooo much better then conventional ones!
Review: I have reached a point of hating the smell of the conventional (aluminum oxide composite I believe) cutoff wheels so much I had to find a solution and so far this has been great!  I haven't cut a ton of steel with it yet but it fits my 5"" Matika perfectly and addresses my concerns about odor, the worry of an exploding wheel and the inconvenience of an ever shrinking cut off wheel which seems to always need to be changed for the final cut of a project.  I will update when I've used it enough to formulate some thoughts on longevity as I don't cut a ton of steel.  All in all I would say to go from this and I opted for the GRAFF just to try something different than the other brand, so far so good.",1
"Title: Not for me
Review: The preview chapters enticed me to buy the book, but after reading 1/3 of the novel I simply did not like the book. The characters were annoying and not likable at all. The plot, after what began as an interesting premise- a space ship returning to earth after a centuries of deep space travel( cryogenics etc.) - sounded intriguing, but then it was back to the old &#34;Something IsOut There And It IsTrying To Kill Us &#34; stuff. There are heavily armed troops in a force field protected enclave which protects them against voracious things, gibberings or kobalds, or something. Worse they( it) is getting smarter, and, well, you get the idea. Old stuff, not presented very well.<br />Queer stuff: the Unlikeable hero at the end of pretty good cha",0

"Title: Boring vanilla romance
Review: I liked the way this book began, with two strong characters but quickly the story moved in a direction that felt like the story was about all the other people in the book.  Too much time was spent on Kent's sister. Her situation could have been an important sub text but ended up dominating the story line. Romance (kissing only) didn't begin until I was 80% through the kindle book.  The kissing was so basic and innocent. For two people that seemed to have an enormous attraction, they were easily distracted by everything around them and found excuses not to indulge in their romance. At 90% I gave up. I just couldn't take the subdued dialogue and passive intent of the book.",0

Review: I purchased these pants for my 6' tall high school volleyball player because she says these are so &#34;cool&#34; and apparently the trend for girls and guys.  She is tall but not overweight...wears a women's 6-8 size.  She fits perfectly in a men's medium so these do run a bit small for men I'd assume.  the length is perfect, the fabric is very nice, soft, comfortable.  They look and feel well made and of good quality.  The waistband tie is thick and strong. They are just right and do look cute on her.  I'd buy for my husband as well but up the size.",1
"Title: Check to see if this is legal in your state.
Review: Love the packaging! Arrived quickly, loved the bling, very well made. What a nice surprise1<br /> However i disliked the fact that by the time I gave the gift and it was put on the car, we found out that the top and  or bottom partially or completely covers some words (Like the State name) and in our state you may be fined for covering the words, and it was too late to return it. So it was given back to me and sits in the box it came in on the bottom of my closet a wasted $40.00. Maybe it mentioned it in the ad., but I am out the money.<br />If it is ok in your state (and you should check your local D.M.V. office don't take anyone's word) , This is a beautiful gift.

"Title: Absolute worst case out there
Review: Absolute worst case out there!<br />Cons: There is no clasp to keep the front cover down, consequently whenever you put the phone in your pocket, it sresses the flimsy hinge. The hinge tore off inside of a week, making this case more useless than it started out to be.<br />The back part of the case is a soft rubber material that does little to protect the phone in case of an accidental drop.<br />Not having a clasp or a magnetic closure to keep the front closed was an idiotic way to design this case.<br />If you're a woman using this case, and you drop it in your purse, you're going to end up with a damaged screen as well since there is no way to keep this case closed.<br />The ONLY &#34;pro&#34; to this case is the front looks nice.",0
"Title: Attractive colors and shapes; better made than most sprinkles
Review: This is a nice collection of blue-themed sprinkles. The shapes consist of spheres of various sizes, and long tubes. The colors are a medium blue, a slightly darker blue, off-white/cream and bright white. Collectively, the colors and shapes make for a much more elegant decoration than the usual sprinkles.<br /><br />I also like and appreciate that the colors are natural, and no artificial dyes are used. A bit more costly than run of the mill sprinkles, but the design and composition make it a good value. Very pleased!",1
"Title: Not Functional--useless junk.
Review: Due to the design of the catches, this cover is not functional.  The manufacturer obviously didn't use humans under real conditions in testing their design.<br /><br />If I cannot open the cover then I cannot put the cover on the outlet and obviously cannot use it. Even if I could manage to open it, the slots intended for the cords to exit the cover are too small for anything much larger than zip cord.  If you have a standard power strip or surge suppressor, those holes would need to be modified.<br /><br />These are the kinds of mistakes that make you wonder how the designer and product manager ever got past the burger flipping stage of their lives.  It should be simple to design a functional outlet cover that humans can use.  That this de",0
"Title: Horrible
Review: Bought two then returned them both. I charged both batteries on receipt. A few days later I tried to use one in my Makita chain saw. The first batter would not even get it up to speed. The second seemed OK. So I went to cut something. It ran fine for a couple of minutes then the speed dropped. I finally went back to an old Makita battery that is near the end of its life. It worked fine and I was able to complete the cut.<br /><br />Makita batteries have always been good, just expensive. I bought a Maximal Power from Amazon a year ago, and it has been fine. I got these because they were cheaper. Well they need to be a lot cheaper to work this poorly.",0
"Title: it's top of the line, what do you expect?
Review: When you combine a good microphone with a good USB digital audio interface, the sound quality will improve immensly. The sole fact that you are using hardware digital sound processing makes a huge difference. Having a nice mic like this definetely helps as well.<br /><br />Don't forget to buy an XLR cable and USB audio interface, as it does not come with either.<br />The Focusrite Scarlett Audio Interface seems to do the job, although most suggest also purchasing a Cloud Lifter to boost the gain of the microphone cleanly, however, this is a matter of preference and whether or not you get clipping at a higher gain. To avoid this, you can use the cloud lifter.",1

Review: I keep this in the car and we often listen to it on the way home from day-care in the evening -- it's very soothing, great winding-down music, but still fun and something you can sing to.  I love it, and find myself listening to it even when I'm kid-free.  Someone to Watch Over Me is incredible, and who would have ever thought that Mickey Mouse Club march could be a lullaby?  It works.  Lots of kids' music is barely tolerable to me.  This is not merely tolerable, I actually really enjoy it.  Love the Nicky's Jazz 4 kids cd, too.",1
"Title: Doesn’t work!
Review: Case came packaged well. Upon removal from box 1st impression was that it was relatively cheap feeling and very thin leather. The case already had some scratches in it as it came out of the packaging. It appears that the leather will easily scratch, it’s more like suede and very thin.<br /><br />My iPhone 14 Pro did fit into the case.  However, the power button, and the volume up and volume down buttons did not work. Unlike my other cases, this case did not have any flexibility where the buttons were located. You can see from the one picture showing the inside where the volume up and down buttons are, the case was just flat and stiff so if you pushed hard to try to get the buttons to work. It ended up pushing both buttons at the same time w",0

Review: These boots are not only nice and warm for winter, but feel like your feet are being pampered with comfort.  Could wear them all day, walking, working, hiking or just hanging out.  Very comfortable and durable.  They also make these in a tall boot about 4 inches taller.  I have a pair of each and recommend them highly.  North Face did it again.  You can also google these boots and see who has them on sale.  Excellent boot.  Didn't even have to break them in.  I hope they do as well for everyone else as they do for me.  Would definitely buy them again.

"Title: Next Stop…Snoozeville!
Review: The label recommends taking two of these, but even when I take just one, I’m off to snoozeville!<br />The Ibuprofen makes it more comfortable to sleep despite your aches and pains, and the Diphenhydramine helps you to nod off.<br /><br />When having a particularly bad evening, I take two of these, and then I’m usually out like a light. They are very affective.<br />One of the reasons why I trust Amazon branded over the counter products, is that they third-party test most of their nutritional supplements. That helps me to have more confidence in the brand. It shows they care about bringing the consumer exactly what the label says is in the bottle.<br />The price is competitive with other house branded ibuprofen products used for sleep.",1
"Title: Best pen ever- but ALL OF THEM LEAK!
Review: Everyone LOVES these pens who tries them.<br />But every single one of them leaks (badly).<br /><br />So I ordered different ink cartriges to put into them from a different brand (hopefully they'll fit) because I love the very professional case the fengtaiyuan pens have. The rubberized surface is lovely to touch. The gold trim on black is very professional looking.<br /><br />Still, I have to give this 1 star sadly. You can't sell pens with the big boys if ALL of the pens in the box leak. Weirdly, they only start to leak once you use them for a little bit. Very strange. There is a major manufacturing error going on here.",0

"Title: Poorly designed.
Review: This tray is obnoxious to use! The Bumbo was not a winner for our son, but that is for a different review. You finally wrangle your little one into the seat and strap them in, then you have to attach the tray. Seems easy, right? Wrong!<br /><br />You have to get the bit that goes between their legs into a hard plastic cup underneath the tray, all while avoiding little fingers that are not well controlled at the stage you use this for. Then, you have to tilt the seat back without dislodging the tray from the leg piece, to shove the bottom lip over the bottom of the seat. All this, again while avoiding fingers. Easy in theory except you are using one hand to tilt the seat back and the other to maneuver the tray. There is no hand left to move ",0
"Title: Great Variety of Tools
Review: I am very pleased with my order of the MKC Wood Carving Tools Set of 11 with Wood Box. The variety of tools is great for me to carve the tops of decorative boxes and add detailed trims to my dollhouse kits. I did find that I needed to sharpen the tools a little bit. I separately purchased a specialty stone to accommodate the shapes of the gouges, but this took little effort for me. I used a rotary tool to sharpen the flat blades. I did not need them too sharp as the wood I use in my dollhouse kits is relatively soft. The box is sturdy and solid which I appreciate as it allows the set to be stored safely. I do recommend to add desiccant packs to absorb moisture that could damage the blades. I hope that my experience with this set is helpful ",1

Review: This is NOT the National Geographic you grew up with.<br />That magazine was sold to Rupert Murdock who quickly destroyed one of the finest magazines in the world.<br />He fired the entire writing staff and replaced it with &#34;Fox News type writers&#34;.<br /><br />For over 125 years this was the premier magazine of GEOGRAPHY in the world.

Definitely, the formula that has been working for them for so many years seems to totally re-invent itself with America.<br /><br />Lyrics are corny, and naive and adorable all at the same time.

"Title: Tired feet? Do something about it!
Review: Expensive and I figured why not. I worked in a chocolate-coffee shop and had to be on my feet all day. Without inserts I felt more tired and exhausted. I then tried other brands and it worked wonders but then it was time for a replacement. I sorted inserts by rating and this came out near the top of the list. I ordered it and once I used it, it was amazing. It works great especially with my boots. I would recommend it if you're on your feet all day but be forewarned, this particular insole is more on the rigid and thick side so it'll take some time to break them in. After that it's great.",1
"Title: Skip the other brands!
Review: Got this for my daughter who was getting frustrated with the baby brezza that would malfunction and just made batches that were too small.  This unit worked so much better even my son in law now enjoys making baby food as well and as the baby approaches his first birthday he has not had any processed baby food...saving my daughter a ton of money and giving my grandson a healthier diet.  If you are considering getting a baby food maker, skip the beabea cook and the brezza for no other reason that within a few months it will not make batches large enough to keep mom interested in using it.  The larger batches with this unit means less work for mom and she is more likely to continue making homemade baby food.  My daughter also felt it did a be",1
"Title: So far this vacuum has good suction but everything else is truly $99
Review: So far this vacuum has good suction but everything else is truly $99. The handle feels flimsy and the plastic it is made of moves when you use the vac. The power bottom is on the lower end and it is easy to confuse with the step bottom for the brush roll and the one for the angle change. The vac does not bend enough to get under the bed and the attachment hose is so flimsy the it falls out all the time. Assembling the machine when you first get it can be challenging. All in all spend some extra money and get something better.",0
"Title: Does not work
Review: I've read and watched many ""how to's"" and fixes to make this thing work, but it only works for a couple of seconds and it goes right back to not performing as intended. This skimmer just does not work for my tank. I tried to ignore the reviews and maybe think they are probably doing something wrong, but boy was I wrong. This skimmer pump is loud and does not make bubbles as it supposed to. It stopped making bubbles on day 2 and even after I cleaned the pump and reassembled it properly. I suggest to trust the reviews on this skimmer and opt to spend the money on a reputable skimmer. I regret the purchase and wished I could return it. You get what you pay for and I paid for a oversized paperweight.",0
"Title: Interesting insights, originally published in 1901
Review: These writings by Zwingli are some significant insights to the thinking of this important reformer (many would say the #3 reformer after Luther and Calvin). These works make interesting reading as his views are still scattered about the Protestant world. These translations also give some insight into religious academic efforts of the early 20th century, as this was published in 1901.<br /><br />The one star rating is because you are paying for the formatting and delivery to your Kindle, as this work is in the public domain and available on OpenLibrary.org [...]",0
"Title: Sweeping Gorgeousness
Review: This album is absolutely gorgeous. I had to come leave a 5 star review to balance out the not-so-hot ratings.<br /><br />I will point out that many of the versions on this album of Laura Mvula's songs are the first versions I ever heard, so I don't have the originals to compare to. A few people complain that Mvula's gorgeous voice doesn't need all the froofy accompaniment, but I believe the orchestral arrangement does nothing but highlight her amazing range as a vocalist.<br /><br />The album is sweeping, moving, and really just a musical treat. If you enjoy being swept up in beautiful orchestration, I think you'll enjoy this album.",1

Review: Device firmware or hardware is defective. Amazon's Echo Dot 2 is defective out of box (tried two of them). The device cannot reliability connect at 5GHz Wireless N. The packet error rate rate is 65 to 90 percent making it unusable. Not only that but the Echo Dot 2 has a mind of it's own. It will wake in the middle of the night asking for authorization to BUY Amazon stuff, play songs, report an error or other bogus interactions. It also will unknowingly switch WIFI networks. I own and use an original Echo Speaker Alexa. It has none of these shortcomings. Works great. Love it. I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"Title: NICE HYDRATING MOISTURIZER
Review: Like most people in colder climates I fight dry, chapped skin in the winter and do everything I can to combat it.  I’ve found that it’s best to prevent my face from becoming dry in the first place so I moisturize morning and night.<br /><br />I have tried and tested many different moisturizers and I like this one by BeauKON.  Unlike other reviewers, I like the citrus smell - it smells of coconut and citrus.<br /><br />It’s a bit thicker than some of the other facial moisturizers I’ve used so it takes a little longer for it to absorb.  That being said, it seems like it does a great job at hydrating my skin for many hours.  I prefer using this moisturizer at night with another, lighter one during the day.<br /><br />This is a quality facial m",1
"Title: Went Into The Garbage Can
Review: I really wanted to like it, but in the end I had to finally admit it just didn't work, at least for me.. The water pressure is not strong enough at the plastic spray nozzles.. It just won't spin a professional Purdy roller cage with a nap loaded with paint. Purdy cages also don't fit in the holding slot. The cheap throw away roller cages with thin metal do, but not professional cages. Also won't get the very top of the roller nap clean.. And even when I tried it with a cheapo roller cage that did fit, it still took over 10 minutes before the nap was reasonably clean, but not perfect.. I went back to my old method, which takes much less time and water... And this went into the garbage.",0
"Title: Terrible packaging, broken frame, no guide
Review: So disappointed for several reasons. First it took almost 6 weeks to come in, it was shipped in a bag that was ripped at the top and the frame was exposed and broken. I had purchased a cheaper one beforehand, and it came already stretched onto the frame, not this one, and for the price it should have been, or stated in the description ""frame comes in separate pieces"". Some of the numbers are not stamped on the canvas and there is no guide to look at. No instructions. Not sure if I attach the canvas before I paint or after. Would not recommend this . sorry.",0
"Title: Baby fell out! Slick fabric!
Review: I did a practice wear around the house, and the fabric (a perforated, slickish fabric, like that mesh fabric used in sports practice jerseys - likely great for shedding water, but low friction and not very stretchy like three regular Moby wrap) kept sliding a bit.  I tried to adjust it to tighten it, but it seemed to dig into my baby's legs and he cried so I stopped.  It was a little loose but seemed fine.  Then it shifted and slid, and he fell right out! Fortunately I caught him, since it was a trial run and I was at attention, but I have been having awful imaginations of what could have happened, ever since.  Ugh.<br /><br />I will say that 1) he's a newborn, so older babies may have a different shape and carry that doesn't lead to them f",0
"Title: MO live in Buffalo NY in January 1973: an epic performance
Review: This 2x CD package is a Soundboard recording of the Mahavishnu Orchestra delivering an awesome live-on-stage performance at the Century Theater, Buffalo NY on 27th January 1973. It was released in Japan by Tachika Records in 2008 and is available only as an import.<br /><br />This offering does not have the quality-presentation feel of an ‘official’ release, but nevertheless the sound is very good for a 1973 recording - if not perhaps up to today’s digital-audio standards.<br /><br />The concert features only 7 numbers:<br /><br />Disk 1:<br /><br />1. Birds of Fire<br /><br />2. Open Country Joy<br /><br />3. Dawn<br /><br />4. The Dance of Maya (titled “Dance of Maya” on the sleeve)<br /><br />Disk 2:<br /><br />1. Sanctuary<br /><br />2.",1

"Title: not what was advertised
Review: This is about the seller(Terrazzo & Marble Supply Company) and not the product.  I know this is not where to post this but I wanted to make sure anyone buying this knew the facts.  I received an empty spray bottle(for $15) that didn't even look like the picture.  The weird thing is that after ordering it, my orders page showed the empty spray bottle that was sent and the link on my orders page took me back to what I thought I was ordering.  This is the first anomaly like this I have had on Amazon and I've ordered a lot of things.  My advise is to order it thru another seller for a dollar more if you really want it.  Thankfully, Amazon was great about it.  They're refunding me and told me I didn't have to do anything else.  So please don't t",0
"Title: The good, the bad, and the boney
Review: This is the first RPG novel I have read and I loved it and was disturbed by it at the same time.  There are so many layers to the novel that when I contemplate one theory, others seem to blossom as well.  The &#34;good&#34; playing bad, the bad playing good, the affect of allowing yourself to give into &#34;evil&#34; wants and desires, how the affect of evil may desensitize your conscious.. I am very anxious for the next novel to see what developed and to see if the good guy that plays a bad guy turns out good, bad, or ugly..  ok.. that was an old movie trying to channel through me..",1
"Title: Pass on these - don't work
Review: Concept of these is great - but they don't work.  They are rubber and they have a ""lip"" on bottom of each strip.  The ""lip"" inserts into the crack between your counter and stove - the problem is the lip is:<br />1.  Not long enough - so the protector strip doesn't stay and basically is useless as it pops out<br />2.  It is too soft - so it folds when you try to insert into your counter crack and again pops out.  I even tried to put in with a screw driver end - and it would stay for 3 seconds and pop out and then wouldn't lay flat.<br /><br />These are awful and I cannot return as there return time is also short - should be 30-60 days on all purchases - so wouldn't buy from this seller again either.  Disappointing - was thinking what a great",0
"Title: This is a great little mic for cleaning up wind noise and creating a clean monitor install.  ^_^
Review: I needed an wind screened microphone to mount under my computer monitor.  There were a lot of units made to mount on the face of a monitor, but my LED monitor has a sub 3/4&#34; border around it and I wanted the microphone to look a lot cleaner than a stick on model.  So I went after one of these instead.  I removed the spring from the clip and filed the end that held the mic smooth, before I used a glue gun to attach the newly smoothed clip under the monitor.  The result was a clean install with no wires showing and a great look.<br /><br />The microphone itself works very well and doesn't catch the wind noise from the tower fan by my work station like the old one used to.  If your looking for a good clip-on microphone or something you can",1

Review: My daughter was gifted this fountain for her room.  We read the directions, set up the fountain and turned it on. All seemed great and she used it for a few days. Then we went to dust and realized there was water all over the furniture it was on. I assumed my daughter over filled the fountain or moved it and spilled the water.  We placed a dry towel under it. I filled to the fill line and we did not turn it on at all.  By next morning the towel was wet. The entire fountain leaks!!!!!!!!!! Huge disappointment!",0

Review: This splitter is required if your provider is Direct TV and you want to split the signal to more than one TV.  You don't have to buy this four way splitter, if I had done more research, I would have purchased a two way splitter because that is all I needed.  It will be used with a Multiswitch SWM8 and a power inserter.  The power inserter must be plugged into the plug marked POWER.  If it isn't the power will not be sent to the multiswitch and you will not receive a signal from your dish to the receiver.  See my review on the SWM8 Multiswitch.",1

Review: I bought this Grille after I decided to fix my own freezer when I discovered ice was forming on the bottom of my freezer.  I didn't realize at the time, what a difficult piece this is to remove from the back of the freezer.  I popped it out and broke the tabs off the back.  Rookie move.  Thankfully I fixed the freezer and saved a lot of money, but then I had to buy a new Grille.... It took a while to determine what the part even was, because there are so many whirlpool parts for different types of freezers, it made my head spin.  Then when I did find the right part, there weren't many available.  I about died when I saw the price.  Almost $30 dollars for a piece of plastic that I broke because I was getting too impatient in taking the Grill",1

Review: A few years ago I decided to go in the hunt for my favorite tea.  I was trying to find a suitable replacement for my coffee addiction.  Well after many, many cups of tea I finally found it—the best tea I’ve had—Taylor’s of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold.  It’s smooth and mellow.  It doesn’t get bitter as so many other brands did even if you forget to take the teabag out in a reasonable time frame.<br />Through this process I discovered that nothing will replace coffee in my life, but I now enjoy the occasional cup of tea also.",1
"Title: Only bra I can wear.
Review: My mother in law saw them on the Oprah show about 7 years ago, and told me about them, since i have such a hard time finding a good supportive fit and a pretty bra (if you are above a D, you know what I mean). Make sure you read the sizing or go to a place that sales them to get the correct size and then buy them on amazon at a 50% discount vs major department stores. My only complaint is after about 6 months the underwire will snap in the middle, or wiggle its way out of the fabric and puncture your armpit, But I also wash mine with the rest of my clothes, maybe if I handwashed with fancy detergent they would last a little longer, but i concider 6 months of supporting these girls a good long run.

"Title: Brilliant and Blendable Alcohol Markers
Review: For a beginner/explorer like me this set is a great introduction to the world of alcohol markers. Professional illustrators use Copecs. (They didn't invent alcohol markers, so these aren't rip-offs.) That very expensive brand offers more colors and their pens are refillable, which these aren't. Theirs also offer a brush tip. These have a chisel tip on one end and a bullet tip on the other. That said, these markers are gorgeous, and a fraction of the cost of their professional cousins.<br /><br />They have a triangular shape so they won't roll off your drafting table and the caps are easy to take off and replace.<br /><br />Buy some Bristol and check out one of the great instructional videos available from illustrators online.

Review: The Road to Dawn provided additional insight into the remarkable life of Josiah Henson, his family, treatment, and disability. In addition to the trick of his slave owners. The research and details are well established. I enjoyed hearing the extended section on the programs Mr. Henson championed, his visits to Europe, his love of the queen, the respect and dignity to which he clung too and his continued love of his fellow freedmen.<br /><br />There were many touching moments, great details, and interesting facts. The ending listed books written to dispute Uncle Tom’s cabin, and the news articles confirming the beating death and treatment were tangible.<br /><br />One thing that did bother me was how an english writer allowed Mr Henson to tu",1

In case you are wondering, there is another piece that goes with this product that you must you.  These baskets go inside of a gray tube.

Review: This is an entertaining, stylized crime show that is quite fun to watch.  As a tough law instructor and attorney, Viola Davis is great.  Her character has selected 5 students to help her office solve a crime each week and find a way to get her clients declared not-guilty.  The characters are quirky and the cases colorful.  Nothing dull about this show. No one is who they appear to be is one theme of the show. There's also a personal situation for Davis' character which needs resolution overarching the series which brings cohesion.  The setting is Philadelphia.  Am always looking for something suspenseful with a problem to solve for treadmilling, and these series is great to exercise to.  Time goes by quickly.  There are some scenes involvin",1

"Title: Gorgeous warm glow in the dark...
Review: The lamp is a beautiful block of salt, with hints of warm color scattered around the surface.  If you look closely, you can see the cubic shapes of salt crystals embedded in places. It is striking even with the light off, but has a wonderful warm glow with the light on. If there is a choice to get a dimmable lamp, I would say definitely do so!  The lamp I have is approximately 9&#34; x 9&#34; x 7&#34; and is rather heavy.  I recommend following their guidelines regarding placement on any surface in order to avoid any damage.

"Title: Did Not Last One Season
Review: This is the second time I’ve purchased this greenhouse. The first purchase lasted for two seasons which I thought I basically got my moneys worth. The poles started cracking and breaking. I thought the main problem was that it was on a deck and the wind blew up underneath it causing it to degrade. So I purchase a second one and I am one month into after setting it up and it is already coming apart at the seams. Did not have this problem on the first one so I’m not exactly sure if this is a unique fault in the sewing for this one or they’ve switched vendors and it’s gotten cheaper. In any event I won’t buy this again one again.",0

The filter installs properly but fridge makes weird tapping noises when I want water, the stream is weak to nonexistent & it leaks inside filter compartment. I cannot read most of the printed blue instructions on a box with blue background (image 2).

Review: Arrived quickly, nice quality, has anti-seize in the package, BUT...  the plug end does not work on my 2008 ML320 as advertised. It's located in a hard-to-reach spot under the engine, and I tried to push the connectors together after installing and it wouldn't work.  Took it back out and compared it to the old one, and noticed the connector was oriented 180 degrees to the OEM part -- the slot is at top instead of the bottom, etc.  So rather than sending it back, I had to carefully remove the wires on the new one, then install them into the plug off of the old one to make it work.  It's in and working great, CEL is off, etc, but this thing isn't easy to change and I didn't need the aggravation of extra time on something that should have been",0

These are 'plasticy', poor in every possible musical response and cheaply glued (or snapped) together. They are and hear me clearly; an overpriced gimmick, a fad item that simply is a visual trend...

Easy to use; you can control how much you fill the cup just by controlling how much you're scooping then, with a flip, you easily dump it into the empty k-cup. And next to no spilled coffee!

Review: I was in a bar with a friend several years ago shooting some pool, and Steely Dan came on the juke box.  My friend grimaced.  ""You don't like Steely Dan?"" I asked. ""No,"" she said with a disgusted look, ""It's cheesy.  It's what my parents listen to.""<br /><br />Fast forward a few years.  I was on a long hike with another friend and we were listing favorite albums.  I mentioned the second and third Steely Dan albums as being among my favorites and asked my friend if he was familiar with them.

Review: This chair is comfortable to spend hours sitting in gaming or just doing computer related office work. I have found it to be sturdy (I weight about 180 and I'm 5' 7""). I spent a great deal of time looking through the Gaming/Office chairs available on amazon for a Cloth/Fabric covered chair that fit my requirements. I'm not a fan of the leather chairs and I prefer a little cushion over the rigid molded plastic chairs. I was surprised how difficult it was to find a fabric covered chair that was sturdy with a high back. This chair did it all, and more. The legs/rollers are sturdy and I haven't had any problem with them sticking or giving way. So far the material has held up well and the filling is not compressing like some cheaper chairs. I di",1

Also, I have tried different brands, but this one is the BEST. (Don't even bother with tomee tipee those are AWFUL!). Anyway, after using these it's so hard to go to a different bib because these are that good. The fit comfortably under baby and have much room to grow. The best part is, it's not so easy for baby to tilt these over. With the other brands baby can lift up the bit just a smudge and our comes all of the nasty drool and food. It's gross.

Review: The oem anco blades lasted 3 years and started to streak badly.  I have had Bosch Icon blades in my previous car and have worked well.  Yes they cost double that of other blades but nonetheless it is not a big expense.<br /><br />Not every car is the same but on my hook style of the Prius, it is just popping the old one out and new one in and takes 5 minutes.  It might help to watch a YouTube tutorial.<br /><br />In any case these wipers are cleaner looking as there is no plastic bracket and it contours to your windshield shape.

Review: I'm vegetarian and come across recipes every once in a while that call for TVP so I bought it just to have on hand. I just used it for the first time and I couldn't be more pleased. I made a ""chicken"" salad with it and it worked perfectly. All you need to do is re-hydrate the TVP (I used warm vegetable broth) and you are ready to go. It will take on whatever flavor you want, you don't have to cook it but you can of course, if the recipe calls for it.  Depending how much liquid or other ingredients you add to it you can shape it into balls or burgers or use as a crumble. I definitely recommend this if you haven't tried it. You don't even have to necessarily use it as a meat replacer, you could use it to just add texture to things.  There is ",1
"Title: Perfect to weigh my Chihuahuas and cats
Review: My wife and I were using a food scale with a big bowl on it to weigh our Chihuahuas, but that cats were too heavy for it so we would have to stand on the bathroom scale holding the cats, then do the math to figure out that cats' weight. And it wasn't very accurate. This scale is perfect. It weighs the cats and the dogs accurately.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the platform where we put the animals is really too big for our needs, and that also makes it a little harder to find a place to store the scale. But that's just a minor gripe.",1

Review: Update my review as of 8/13/2018--- I was contacted by the seller today who took care of this issue for me.  Extremely happy and would gladly recommend to all!<br /><br />Review form 8/10Ordered this on 07/01/18 and it arrived a few days later.  Installed new batteries and enjoyed how colorful and cute it is.  Now it's 08/10/18 and the bulb has already failed to the point that it it can't be seen at night.  (What's the point!?!). I've looked for a replacement bulb for over a week and to no avail.  Really loved this little guy but if the light is only going to last a month, it isn't really worth the price.  No way to contact the company so I'm out the cost.  Again, cute turtle but worthless if you're wanting to use it as a nightlight.",1
"Title: OSP - poor customer service for a product that did not work
Review: Purchased this product in 2010. Used it a handful of times. Then, it sat, unplugged from electricity and set up, in an upstairs carpeted room. There were no animals and no kids. Sept, 2012 I plugged it in, turned it on - and the MODULE, the main part, simply WILL NOT WORK. The adapter light is on, so I know the adapter works. I contacted the company OSP - all they could do was OFFER TO SELL ME A NEW MODULE FOR $125. I already paid $449.00 for the whole kit originally. So, beware - again, used it about 5 times, took excellent care of it and it NO LONGER WORKS AT ALL. The whole thing turns about to be A WASTE OF MONEY. The amazon seller 7ballmusic has provided good customer service, however all they were able to do was refer me back to the OS",0
"Title: Beautiful Sealer
Review: This sealer kit works fantastic on oil paintings and gives each painting that perfect hold as well as a beautiful shine.  I feel like this sealer would be essential in any painting piece and is so easy to work with it is great for beginners.  The quality is smooth and easy to spread, very fluid. The price is absolutely reasonable too and I recommend anyone who does paintings, regardless of what media you are using, that you make this part of your supplies on a regular basis.  I will be purchasing this sealer again and I hope you find this review helpful!",1

Review: It's not easy to find cute and adorable collars for larger dogs. If you do they are cheaply made and fall apart so easily.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the craftsmanship of this collar. The leather is the real thing and the jewels aren't just glued on to fall off later.<br /><br />I really liked that the place to attach tags is separate from the leash attachment.<br /><br />Overall great collar. No flaws that I have discovered.<br /><br />I was selected to review this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",1
"Title: In honor of Black History month ""All people are Black to me""
Review: When I read the title I thought it was just a play on words for a story about a blind young man seeking his independence. It never occurred to me that this would be an interracial MM romance. Two college educated young men end up at the same job. Yet they couldn't be more different. One is black and one is white. One was raised by a single parent while the other had two parents with PhDs. The parents wanted what they believed was best for their sons.<br />The sons that never expected a work friendship would lead to more. Two men who fascinated each other. They wondered what attracted the other to him. It was fascinating to observe how family dynamics shaped these young men and what led to their ""rebellions"". Learning how difficult it was fo",1

Review: Very durable, especially  the vulnerable corners which can be prone to cracking.  Smooth rounded inside bottom corner and side edges make for easy cleaning.Used to be the Rubbermaid products sold in retails stores lasted forever -- now they've been replaced by inferior, thin plastic brands like Sterlite. You're lucky if they last a year without cracking or splitting .  But the commercial line is Rubbermaid like it used to be.  Sure it's more expensive, but how many times are you going to replace the junky Big Box brands?

"Title: A real page turner!
Review: When it comes to historical romance many authors either over dramatize the plot or make their characters possess extreme personal qualities (usually bad ones). I mean if it's a duke or an earl he will be extremely brooding and forbidding or if it's a lady she is either in distress or a wanton. This book was blessedly in the middle. I would compare this writing style slightly to that of Judith McNaught. It was a nice blend of Victorian glitter, strong-willed MCs and a fair amount of intrigue.<br /><br />Ms Landon managed to make Grace seem innocent and yet alluring at the same time. Even though she was in trouble she didn't depend on a man to save her and she made her own choices. There was none of those small misunderstandings to ramp up th",1
"Title: Why do I love this pencil
Review: OK so I'm a mechanical pencil snob.  I openly admit it.  I laugh at those cheap throw BICs that are like 10 for a buck.  I have a decent collection of 0.9mm pencils.  (ohto pm509, pilot s3, uni shift, helix expert, pentel gg 529, pentel sharp 209, pentel gg1000) and use them all.  When I first got this pencil I was a little let down.  I was expecting a nice heavy end like the graphgear 500 series but a trimmer profile.  Nope the metal grip is actually a sleeve that slids over the thinner plastic barrel.  Other than that this pencil is identical in terms of mechanics to the 500 series.  Then I used this pencil for an evening.  Wow what an insturment.  It felt so good in my hand and wrote so smoothly without the slightest hind of tip wiggle o",1

Review: I have a chunky 10-pound Yorkie/Australian terrier. I have her one of those donut marshmallow type of beds that she absolutely loves.  I bought this bed to put in the bedroom.  She loves this bed. She's older and I think it helps her arthritic bones to sleep on this. So, it's staying in the den and the round bed will be the bedroom bed.

I believe it's faux leather (or poor quality leather), and doesn't hold up very well to toddler abuse. Sadly, these are now her spare mess-around boots and not her nice ones...they barely lasted a week. DON'T BUY!!",0

I love how there is so much detail in it and that you can see a lot of effort has gone to making sure that this jacket is well made. In addition, the stitching and emblems on the jacket are absolutely perfect and looks so pretty in person. Moreover, the material of the jacket has a silk in it so not only does it look more high quality but if something falls on it it slides right off. I feel like I can throw this on with any outfit and it will just look great! Amazing jack at an unbelievable price!!",1

Ok, so let me get this straight....I'm supposed to give my cat, who hasn't been eating well anyway, food mixed with this medicine that tastes really bad and expect her to finish it?  And I was supposed to do this twice a day?  It was a disaster from the start.  So I went searching for a solution and found these.  Once I got them, I made myself a tiny funnel from some paper, and used an itty bitty measuring spoon to pour the right amount of the medicine into the caplets.

"Title: Just Right For Table Saw Outfeed Table Mobility
Review: These casters easily lift the weight of my saw's outfeed table, which has a modified 2x4 base and two layers of 3/4&#34; melamine for the top. They lift upward about 1/2' to 3/4&#34; off the floor, depending on how you affix them to the legs. Urethane wheels roll effortlessly on my polyurethane-painted concrete floor. Two #8 or #10 x 1-1/2&#34; screws attach them to the legs. You can bolt them if you have metal legs. The screws are more than enough in wood.<br /><br />I paired them with [[ASIN:B0035Y5XUK Heavy-Duty Leg Levelers, Small Foot (4)]]. These leg levelers allowed me to adjust the table height precisely to match the table saw's height and to assure the outfeed table was in plane with the top of the saw.",1

Review: This is such a wonderful convenient item. I am able to move it from the car to the truck as it is so portable. Install is super easy. If you have a cover on your phone, you slip the magnetic pad inside the case, on the backside of your phone and close the case. If you don't have a case, you apply the round magnetic piece to the back of your phone. It is permanent, so be sure you want it there as it is not removable. I have tested this in both vehicles and gotten very good results. It is stable when mounted and stays put, even when encountering bumps or tough road. I'm very pleased with this purchase and may order another just so I have one in each vehicle.",1

Review: This is a very versatile piece of notation software. I love that I can add effects, add drums, and a huge number of other things. The ability to save and/or print your notation in a variety of formats and in a variety of notation styles is very helpful when playing with a band or other musicians. I also like that I can import different types of files and have them automatically transcribed. In all, it is much better and feature rich than the previous version and a great value for any guitarist, bassist, or any musician who wants to be able to write music for guitar, bass, or any other instrument. Very highly recommended!",1

Review: To function, it requires that your Emby server have a static IP and connection to the broader Internet. If, like me, you have dynamic IP in your home, when you try to make it to anything, it says that it can't find your emby server, and if you've changed the IP address you should reload the skill. (Given that this happened first time I tried, it's useless.) Also I have a pretty good firewall, so the outer world can't see my emby server at all. However, Alexa is inside the firewall, and so is Emby, so there's no reason they can't communicate. Except that the skill doesn't work.",0
"Title: Impressed!  Skin is left silky and smooth.
Review: I purchased this product because I'm in my late thirties and I am needing some additional &#34;help&#34; in my skin routine.  Your skin does need to be damp to help this scrub &#34;stick&#34;.  To test it when I first received it, I used it on the back of my hand.  I didn't know until using it that I had a few cracks on my knuckles from dry skin.  Once the scrub was on my hand they obviously started to burn because this is... well.. a SALT scrub.  :-)  So if you have any cracks, you may want to avoid that particular area.  However, the results was stunning.  I actually wasn't really expecting anything different than my regular apricot scrub, but wow.  My hand was silky soft and felt hydrated.  I was really impressed.

Review: I REALLY like this and find it comparable to my high end brow products of a similar type.<br /><br />I can't speak to the durability of this product as of yet, but, I can say that the color and color payoff is spot on! It is an ashy dark brown. Now I want ash light or medium brown if it exist.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, it's so saturated, I'll need to use a light hand, especially at the inner corner of my eyebrows to keep it from being to intense.<br /><br />It is also seriously Waterproof!

Review: After carefully reviewing products to replace last year's Panasonic phones, I decided on this purchase. My expectations were that they would be better than last year's models, I was very wrong. The range was worse, even with the range extender that I had to purchase extra. I spent several hours on the phone with Panasonic customer service and after the fourth call I would only speak to a supervisor. Even with his help the phones sounded terrible. People calling me said that they couldn't understand the words I was saying and I kept hearing a crackling on my end of the phones as if the speaker was broken.  Also, sometimes the phone would ring at the base unit, and none of the other four phones would ring so you couldn't answer the phone with",0

Review: If you love reading blogs about people's lives or enjoy Facebook posts then this book will interest you. ""Welcome Home"" is Akiva Teddy MacLeod's brief memoir about living in Israel after moving from Toronto, Canada. This is the story of life in Kiryat Yam, a suburb in Northern Israel by the Mediterranean sea. Yes there are lots of stories of swimming and it sounds a bit dangerous but that makes this story all the more adventurous.<br /><br />What I loved most about this book is the descriptions of all the delicious foods the family encounters.

Review: 1982. One of my favorite vinyls of that decade. Hard-edge pop. Even now I love it. How stuff like this can just disappear is a mystery. Love Crimes--their second album--same thing. There's like one cd on the planet. We're so modern. There appears to be a version of the group still alive--I buy whatever I can find. The albums I have (Love Crimes, One False Move) were written mostly by the singer George Belanger, and the guitarist Glen Willows. Pretty tight stuff--excellent guitar all through. Arranged well. Kinda pounding even. The sound is what I love. Produced by Jack Douglas--Lennon, Cheap Trick, Aerosmith, Patty Smith--they certainly had a pro working their songs.

At the end of a hard day, there is nothing better than making a fire and enjoying some quality time together.  This fire pit features a very simple design and is absolutely built to last. It is made from very thick metal so you can be assured that it won't rust out after a couple seasons.<br /><br />It comes encased in Styrofoam to ensure it won't be damaged during shipping. All you have to do is screw on the three legs and you're ready to go. It's ideal to have three legs because that ensures the fire pit will be stable even if you place it on an uneven surface. This is an excellent fire pit that will allow you to create special memories with friends",1

I have to remember that the device I want to print from is connected to the same Wi-Fi as my printer.  If I do that then I never get into trouble.

I bought a perfectly sized sailcloth to cover the railing in a shade that closely matches the color of the stucco.  That way it doesn't stand out so much that my apartment management will force me to take it down.

Review: While the packaging isn't exactly the greatest, the music it contains sure is.  Many a happy memory on every one of the four discs included.  Took me back to junior high and the days of local radio WJLK (Asbury Park) and the two Top 40 New York powerhouses of the airwaves WMCA and WABC, the AM-radio giants on the East Coast.  The discs play beautifully, and the hits are programmed in chronological order and in all the monophonic glory of the era. The Top 40 era worked wonders in breaking down all kind of social barriers, subtly and unapologetically.  These four CDs offer the aural proof.  An unquestionable Five Stars and very highly recommended, especially to fans of early '60s pre-Beatles Americal pop radio.",1

I love little Max whose sniffer comes in handy sometimes for finding evidence. He ended up with a sweet little houseguest, but since said houseguest had an owner, he had to go back eventually. But sometimes with cute dogs come handsome owners...for unattached sisters, as I could tell Chloe's brain was working toward. It did help that Izzie seemed to be interested!<br /><br />During the case itself, Chloe did seem to be getting closer to Hunter like she wanted to. She's just kinda scared to commit but he seems li",1
"Title: Was going to order an interocitor, but this is way better
Review: I was/am a huge fan of the MST3K series - still have a ton of the episodes on tape. Saw this movie the first day it hit the theaters here in Austin - thought it was great.<br /><br />I was happy to see that there is a bluray edition of this coming soon, as I really need to replace my old laserdisc copy. So I've got it pre-ordered and can't wait to get it. I know this really ain't a review for the actual item - but as soon at it arrives, I'll bang out a review for it (well, I'll take time to watch it first).<br /><br />Also went ahead and pre-ordered this, [[ASIN:B00EALTWRC Mystery Science Theater 3000: 25th Anniversary Edition [Limited-Edition Collector's Tin]]]<br /><br />ETA:<br /><br />Got the DVD/Bluray set in - the movie looks great on",1
"Title: Duplicate Death!
Review: In London, a social climbing woman is hosting a card party. Two people are murdered by the same method, they were strangled by picture wire. Inspector Hemingway is on the case, but when the fiancé of his friend becomes the main suspect, he has to figure out the truth to clear her name.<br />I really wanted to like this novel because I thought Footsteps in the Dark was a great one. But, I couldn’t get through the slow pace and the murder took about 100 pages to occur. By that time, I wasn’t really interested in what happened or the culprit’s identity. I received an Advanced Reader Copy of this book from NetGalley and am voluntarily reviewing it.",0
"Title: Michael Bay, get out of Ridley Scott's body!
Review: Spoiler alert ***<br /><br />A team of so-called scientists who clearly have no experience as... scientists? A screenplay that makes no effort<br />what-so-ever to get out of a genre made popular by Hollywood? Insipid dialogues that make you understand why the<br />""Architects"" of the story want to destroy us? Must i go on? I mean, there are stuff in this movie that are unworthy of a talented director like Ridley Scott. Is this another case of a brilliant director (like Brian DePalma) hitting a wall with a sci-fi flick (like ""Mission To Mars"")? It's Ridley Scott, for crying out loud! The man behind the first ""Alien"" movie and ""Blade Runner"". Knowing how long it takes to work on a movie, knowing how many people question a screenplay during t",0
"Title: STAY AWAY
Review: Let me start by saying that i have been a professional musician and electric guitar builder for many years now and i bought this pickup for a strat build for a client that wanted a SRVish thing going on. so while i planned to wind the pickups myself i thought i would buy once to take it apart to get a little more familiar with it and perhaps use the components for the build since parts for these pickups are very hard to find and i am not taking apart a seymour duncan haha so this review comes from a slightly different perspective than than the musician just looking to drop something into his guitar and have a &#34;Lipstick tube&#34; pickup.

"Title: Wonderful Citrus
Review: This has the most wonderful happy inducing citrus smell. I love it! This is my first solid lotion stick, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. This really is for spot treatments not your whole body. Imagine trying to rub a stick of deodorant from head to toe... yeah not so great. This kinda goes on like that.<br /><br />However, it is great for spot treatments of hands, feet, elbows... anywhere needing extra TLC.<br /><br />Anywhere I've put it has been softer, better moisturized, and smelling like pure happy citrus sunshine. A very easy product to give 5 stars!",1
"Title: Gorgeous Bridesmaid/Pageant Dress for little girls!
Review: LOVELY dress for a bridesmaid or any little girl that needs a fancy dress for Christmas! I got in in red for my Goddaughter, who is 8, and she loves it. It is lined, so although it has lacew on top it isn't itchy, and the tulle and layers make her feel like a princess.<br />The ribbon at the waist can be tied in a plain bow but is long enough for a double bow.<br />Just a tip for anyone who is not familiar with these types of dresses: if you turn the dress inside out and hang it upside down, spray it with a little water after you get it and then blow dry on low heat, it will poof up nicely.<br />My pictures make it look a little brighter red than deep red as we had soft lights on in the house and it was evening.",1
"Title: fresh, natural local bakery taste. Lightly sweet, great balance of lemon & ginger
Review: Fresh, natural taste that reminds me of something I would pick up at a local bakery. I am rather impressed. The lemon and ginger flavors are subtle but noticeable. A punch of tangy lemon with a bite of ginger. Lightly sweet, good crunch. Holds up well in coffee or tea. I am not much of a tea drinker but this flavor is especially awesome dunked in hot tea.<br /><br />I also love their Cranberry variety. I do not like their almond variety at all (and almond is usually my go-to favorite).<br /><br />The pieces come loose in a bag, two bags per box. I put my open bag in my own pressure zip baggie.<br /><br />I recommend this variety of biscotti as well as their cranberry variety.<br />www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08776MGD3",1
"Title: Take the entire coffee pot with you!
Review: I got this Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Wide Mouth, Shelline Vacuum Insulated Keeps Liquid Hot or Cold 68 oz for my husband to use while we are fishing. Up until this magical wonder entered our lives, he had been using two 20 ounce Contigo thermoses, which honestly hardly lasted the day. He would have one down by half after the 30 minute drive to the lake and the other one and a half empty before we caught our limit (and they are always biting).<br /><br />Enter this beauty! This monstrosity is a gift from above! He can fill it with nearly an entire carafe of coffee (he has a 14 cup coffee maker) and it keeps it hot to the last drop. I cannot say how long this thermos will keep coffee hot because my husband is a coffee fanatic and drin",1
"Title: Typical Chinese JUNK - look elsewhere
Review: [[VIDEOID:5ebc3143428adc65fd28519318339f63]] The fool who sewed the hook+eye (note - it is NOT ""VELCRO"" but junk Chinese 'hook+eye) sewed it on the OUTSIDE of the view port. It wasn't noticeable - at least at first - so when the view port was opened, there was resistance and pulling it TORE the fabric and made the view port USELESS. The zippers are also throw-away (non U.S. made Chinese junk). They pull the backing fabric into the zipper teeth, zipper hangs up and you must screw around with it for an hour to keep from doing even MORE damage.<br />This product certainly does NOT measure up to U.S. standards and the company seems to care little about QUALITY. There certainly was no quality inspection performed.<br />We cannot recommend this p",0
"Title: Great little wallet!
Review: I was tired of my bulky wallet in my back pocket. As summer has arrived and I have shedded my coats and sweaters, I found that I needed more pockets on me for my phone, iPod, headphones, etc. So I needed something light and thin to replace my bulky wallet.<br /><br />This minimalist wallet holds almost everything I need - ID, credit cards, a little cash it only holds a few bills. (I don't really carry cash, but it's nice to have some sometimes). I transferred MOST of my old wallet to the new minimalist and now I don't feel like I am carrying anything. I guess for real bills, change, and useless cards, will have to be kept separate in my other pants pockets. Its a small sacrifice I have to make, but well worth it.<br /><br />Quality is excel",1
"Title: Frustrating Sound Issue
Review: This product is very easy to set up and worked great initially. Having a lot of fun with it. After 2 weeks, it has inexplicably lost half of its volume and speakers were crackling. Every so often, we get five minutes of normal volume before it goes away again. Have asked for help, but generally get what appears to be a standard email. Have replied but not heard back. While I would prefer to see if there is anything that can be done, it looks like we may need to return. Hate to do it, as it was so much fun. Maybe need to look at another system.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />After two weeks of back-and-forth emails, we finally got a shipping label to return/exchange the defective main speaker. As it is ground shipping, it has taken five days to reac",0
"Title: THE BEST MEDITATION GUIDE I HAVE TRIED
Review: Learning to Meditate is not easy! I have a problem keeping my mind from roaming. I think any time we are serious about learning anything new, most of us are looking for the magic bullet-the ONE perfect answer to making it all happen. This DVD is so far the BEST I've tried.  After about a week & a half of consist practice at the same time every morning my mind still wanders, but I can feel a change in the depth of my concentration. Maritza knows you will have a wandering mind, & she tells you in softly accented French to leave judgments behind. The only accompaniment to the Meditation section is Tibetan bells & bowls over a low, non-invasive hum-perfect for bringing your mind to deeper conscious levels.<br /><br />The DVD consists of a 15-mi",1
"Title: The wait was worth it!
Review: If you're already a fan of HPLHS's Dark Adventure Radio Theatre, &#34;The Thing on the Doorstep&#34; does not disappoint.  If this is your first DART program, dim the lights and get ready for a great listen. This is an exceptionally well done program in a series of exceptionally well done programs.  The story is dramatized perfectly; the script catches the creepiness and the delivery of the script by the voice actors is superb. Additionally the supporting prop documents are true standouts. Fans of DART have been asking for an adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's &#34;The Thing on the Doorstep&#34; for quite a while.  The wait was worth it!",1
"Title: Junk
Review: As others have indicated, this comb is junky and not comparable to previous Ace combs. I purchased this to replace an older classic Ace comb and the difference couldn't be greater. Coincidentally, I also have a 10 pack of random combs purchased from the dollar store. This Ace comb is comparable to those. Save your money, if you want a cheap comb (flimsy with sharp tips) just get a multi-pack at the dollar store. As one other reviewer indicated, using sandpaper does reduce the sharp tips, but doesn't correct the overall lack of quality.",0
"Title: Very comfortable socks
Review: I really like these socks a lot. They are super comfortable to wear. These are made out of mostly cotton and some synthetics which help you with the elasticity and make sure they stay put and fit you properly.<br /><br />These are perfect to wear under dress pants when you don't want skin showing really. They have the perfect height, just high enough to cover your ankles and such but not higher up since those to me are just not comfortable.<br /><br />They have a loose top fit which makes them non constricting. I like that a lot and it also helps if you have diabetes, blood flow issues because of your veins or if you are pregnant when you don't want to constrict blood flow.<br /><br />They are seamless in the toe and cushioned in the heel m",1
"Title: Love this fan
Review: I bought this fan, one for our sunroom 6 x 15', and one for each of our 3 bedrooms approx 10X 12' in our shore house. The blades are either cherry or oak color in a design almost like unfinished wood.  We used the oak color in the bedrooms and they are very nice for a shore house or a simple bedroom. The fan is flush and quiet. We have 8 foot ceilings and the flush is perfect. There are 2 directions for the blades to spin. The globes are pretty and hold 3 thin base candelabra bulbs. The part of the fan which goes against the ceiling is a very classy brushed nickel color. We bought Westinghouse because we have had this brand of fan in 2 of our bedrooms in our primary residence for 8 years and have had no problems and they are quiet and put o",1
"Title: DON'T BUY THIS WIG
Review: I was excited until I opened the package and realized it was a used unit, The worst of all is that it is not even human hair. I got a used and synthetic wig. I've burned it and let me tell you sis that when you put fire to natural hair it doesn't look like that 😡it smells so much like plastic, and a sticky substance was formed. I'm very disappointed. I asked for a refund and returned it was just thrown into the bottom of the bag. Completely disgusted... Don't buy here. Misleading advertising!!!!",0
"Title: strong magnets, cheaper than in stores
Review: These are strong magnets. My primary use is to hold down aluminet shade cloth on my car when at dog trials.  I started by using the hooks to hold down the cloth via grommets, but realized it's easier just slap these onto the cloth itself.  They haven't scratched my car yet, but I pull them off straight off, without sliding them off.  You can pick these up in hardware stores, but they are cheaper on Amazon.  I wanted six of them, so it made sense to buy them here.  I eventually ordered another six.",1

"Title: So glad TV guide is still available
Review: I find out so much information going on in the television world in a timely manner with TV Guide.  Because this world is changing and moving so quickly, especially technology, it's a such a pleasure that TV Guide understands they are still needed and wanted.  I have an attic antenna for local channels and subscribe to a couple of streaming services.  With TV Guide, I know ahead of time what's coming on now, being renewed or dropped for the new seasons. There are a lot of stories about the programs, actors, themes, the why, when, what and where's of what's going on for not only the local channels, but the streaming service companies also.  One more thing; the subscription is very affordable and I subscribed for online and home delivery. I li",1

"Title: Perfect gym bag
Review: This bag is pretty sizable.  I use it for the gym.  It fits everything I need for the gym and shower afterward.  Including a pair of work boots.  There is no separate section for wet or dirty clothes like some gym bags, no big deal.  The bag folds up into a small pouch if you want to store it away somewhere.  You could easily use it for a weekender bag, it would fit in an overhead bin or under the seat in most aircraft.  The material and construction is pretty sturdy.  I am a pretty faithful buyer of Dakine products.  I have a few backpacks, a rolling duffel and now this one.  Not disappointed.",1
"Title: Basically a pro-Trump book
Review: There is nothing in here that is really critical of Trump. The author is just a hard-core evangelical Christian and is one of these guys who is going to be on the Trump train forever.  He says a lot of ridiculous things about Trump. For instance, that no matter what kind of chaos is going on around him, Trump is normally calm and unflappable. How can this be true when he is always tweeting out hysterical messages at 2 o’clock in the morning? Or he will say that Trump has this amazing ability to flawlessly ad-lib. When has Trump ever been flawless? What you’re talking about his grammar, spelling or just coherence of ideas.  Basically the author lobs mild criticisms at fellow staffers but makes sure that Trump is not defamed in any way.",0
"Title: Savings you don't need
Review: I ordered these cartridges on the assurance from an Amazon staff member that these were really remanufactured by HP, because it said ""by HP"" in the product description.  The package arrived.  These were clearly not ""by HP"".  I put them in my printer.  The ink levels were extremely low, with about 1/6 of the ink left.<br /><br />I might have accepted them, even if they were not refills of spent HP cartridges (I am no fan of HP ink pricing either), but when you only get 1/6 of the ink for 1/3 of the price, I am not the one who is enjoying a good deal.<br /><br />So, back to genuine pricey HP cartridges it is.

Review: These ear cuffs are very pretty. They look very nice. They are very easy to put on the ear. You can squeeze them slightly to make them fit right. I was able to get them to fit on my ears as was my ten year old daughter.<br /><br />These seem like quality pieces. They are unique. It is a great alternative to getting another piercing with all the worry and permanence of that. They look just like the picture. They are really very nice but not too over the top. They would look great for a festival but I think they are also fine for everyday wear.<br /><br />I like that they are real sterling silver. They come very nicely boxed. They are a good thickness. I think they are a good value, as well. I would recommend them.",1
"Title: severely underestimates actual temperature
Review: This thermometer should not be trusted. Ear temperatures and forehead temperatures sometimes fluctuate by 3F and often the value is considerably lower than the temperature measured by an oral thermometer. We sent our daughter to daycare believing she did not have a fever and they measured a fever of over 102. Initially we thought we were just measuring wrong but I felt like I was having a fever myself recently and the thermometer did not show any abnormal temperature. After 5 days with fever I got an oral thermometer which shows a difference of 2F wrt both ear and forehead measurements taken with the Innovo. As far as I know ear and forehead measurement should be reliable so it seems that this thermometer is just not working well. The ease ",0

Review: I really like many Playrix games in general and enjoyed the earlier &#34;scapes&#34; games. Not a fan of this one at all. I dislike the idea of not being able to win later levels without purchasing power ups. Would much rather pay for the game itself than get a &#34;free&#34; game and get sucked into buying more and more items. Not that I got sucked into spending a dime.

"Title: Poorly edited, acted, and written.
Review: To each his own but I thought this movie was terrible. George C. Scott was a great actor but here he is at his growling, scene-chewing worst; the editing is horrible - the film jumps around with little or no transition; characters appear out of nowhere with no explanation; the writing is laughable. It's a hodge-podge of arguably scary moments which seem to be thrown in for effect only and do not contribute to the story. My biggest complaint is the lack of consistency and plot development.  In an encounter between Scott's character and a Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson), I could discern no explanation for the character's bizarre behavior. Suddenly, Scott's character is backing away from someone - you assume it's Temple - with a terrified expression",0

Needless to say, I have struggled greatly to even get through half of this book and haven’t picked it back up because of the utter snooze fest it is. It’s not typical of my feeling of other King books that I usually stay up way too late binge reading. I’ve read reviews that it’s a great ending, but I can’t even make it there.

Thank goodness for Amazon and their 2 year warranty.<br /><br />I wanted to follow up on this, that this Swatch failing on me as well as another one that I also purchased that I had to send back has nothing to do with Area Trend.

I just watch tv or do something around the house while washing clothes and go back to washing every 15 minutes. It sounds like a lot but, it’s A LOT better then sitting in a crowded  laundry mat for a few hours. I didn’t think it would last this long but decided to give it a shot. Believe me… if your sick of going to the laundry mat then this is for you!<br />FYI… I’m single and live alone, idk if this exact model would be best for a family but there are different brands and models that my family used in the past that 100% work for a family.

"Title: Worked perfectly for a 2013 Grand Cherokee Laredo!
Review: I had the Weathertech floor mats in my old Lexus, and they were a lifesaver. After buying my Grand Cherokee, I decided to purchase the Husky brand this time because they were slightly less expensive than the Weathertech version, as I would have had to buy them separately (front floor mats and second row). I also looked into other brands, but was concerned by some of the reviews regarding the fit and coverage in the back (underneath the driver and passenger seat).<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with this purchase. They fit in snugly right away, whereas in the past with the Weathertech mats I had to wait for it to get warm enough for them to &#34;mold&#34; to the areas.

Review: Everyone should read a book about setting boundaries for their own mental and physical health. If you are stressed out in life there may be some very good reasons. According to the authors of this brilliant book you need to figure out what is your responsibility and what isn't. The advice in this book might even help you overcome depression, anxiety, addiction and relationship struggles. Some of the parenting advice in this book is the best I've ever read.<br /><br />Words are powerful and what you say to other people should come from your heart.

Review: I had to return the bundle me because it doesn't fit our Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30 car seat.  The car seat has side impact protection wings by our baby's head (which I love for the added safety) but it meant that the bundle me didn't fit.  First I tried stretching the back of the bundle me over the side impact wings which made it impossible to fit the 5-point harness straps through the bundle me without interfering with the straps positioning to the point that I thought it was unsafe because the straps had to loop up and around to get through the holes.  Then I tried not putting the bundle me over the impact wings but that left a lot of extra fabric where the baby's head would be, which I thought was a suffocation hazard.  In the e",0
"Title: So far, so good!
Review: There were plenty of poor reviews for these, but I bought them anyway. I have owned these in the past and to make myself sure of the hold, I add a small sized carabiner between the two loops as an extra hold. Then I can still release the carabiner and then open the key chain to separate the key sets. This has been perfect for me. This is not just good for valet parking, but I think about car jackings and crazy stuff, I don't want anyone getting my house keys! This allows me easy release of the key set.",1
"Title: Cheap, does not last, ""One gets what one pays for.""
Review: Pick another brand! The corner had a hairline fracture that cause the black border to peel back literally as soon as I put it on my brand new $1,000 iPhone mini (high sales instead of three-figure income tax here, plus Apple got greedy and no longer includes the charging block or basic wired earbuds) and wiped the screen cover with napkin and natural thymol cleaning spray (works for everything, from kitchen to mirrors). My heart sunk. I thought I would not even have time to turn on the phone and set up the overpriced AppleCare + Theft/Loss, but it was the cover, not the phone. (No photo yet because I just set it up and already reset the former iPhone but roommate asked me what brand NOT to buy, and so I pulled up Amazon on the old Mac!)<br ",0

Review: Used as instructed on our smooth top stove top. Glossy side up. Matte side down. Used it with a big pot of beans and smelled something &#34;funny&#34;. Picked up the pan and the black coating was melting and sticking to the pan. As it is extremely hot (and I couldn't use the handle because the pot was larger) I couldn't even move it off the eye.<br /><br />Companies need to test on all surfaces and types of heat source before marketing things that could be dangerous to the consumer.  Would have been great if it worked, I'm sure.  Buyer beware!",0

Review: Kudos to Dark Horse for keeping this train wreck on track.  I've commented on the other recent installments about the sad direction this series has taken and it just seems to get worse and worse.  Poor story, poor artwork...sigh. I love Conan and really loved the earlier volumes, but now I'm just hoping they pull the rip cord on this one and maybe someone else will take the reigns.  If you're looking for good reads and good artwork check the early ones and leave these newer ones on a shelf where they belong.",0

Review: Wasn't sure what to expect with this dress but it looked really cute on the site so I took a gamble. The material is a little rough and burlapy. I washed it but it's still pretty stiff. I'm hoping that down the road it'll soften some. My daughter didn't like it on me and said it made me look fat...Gotta love the honesty of a 7 yr old!!!

"Title: Tastes great and has lots of protein and fiber!
Review: This variety pack of GoodWheat Single Ingredient Wheat Pastas all taste delicious! They do require a little longer cooking time than regular pasta, but once done, I can hardly tell the difference. I love that they have lots of protein and fiber, unlike regular pasta, and they keep you full so much longer.<br /><br />Each tastes great with just butter and a little salt and pepper. Of course, they also lend themselves very nicely to any type of sauce. They also make wonderful pasta salads.<br /><br />I love cooking them in my pressure cooker, adding in whatever frozen vegetables and sauce when they are just about Al Dente.

"Title: Watchband lost color within short time.
Review: I purchased this watch for couple of months ago. I have worn it daily, but not at night and never near water.  Within two weeks, I noticed that the attractive blue leather watchband was losing color. Within the first month, it was noticeably faded in large patches. At this point, about two months after purchase, the watchband looks so bad that I need to get it replaced. That having been said, the watch face itself is very attractive and has kept great time. Nonetheless, you should think twice before buying this watch with this particular band. You will be replacing the band shortly after purchase.",0
"Title: The Bargain of the Century
Review: One of the greatest pianists ever - and every studio recording he ever made - all 140+ CDs worth.  The Chopin alone usually would have everyone clamoring for the set.  Don't forget, he recorded the Chopin Mazurkas 3 times, Nocturnes twice, and so on.  Also, Rubinstein's development from a highly virtuoso performer to an increasingly noble and classy artist can be clearly illustrated by hearing the recordings from the 1930s to the 1970s.  And, for the first time ever, you can hear Petrushka played by the pianist it was written for.  An absolute must.",1
"Title: Really good little Train
Review: My son loved this train. I had been looking for 1 that made all the real sounds and this was it. Plus its not loud enough to drive me nuts. Hes hooked up 8 wooden & plastic trains to it & let it pull them. We dont have a track and this is on tile. Its slow, but he has enough time to come running to me to say &#34;the train is coming&#34;. Im pretty amazed with it. Battery do go fast. It take 2 different kinds. The  power uses 1 AAA. Sound uses a couple of the round (CMOS lithium) kind for hearing aids. I havent had to replace them yet & dont expect to for a while. They were included. The forward-off-reverse lever was complicating for my son to understand at first. He got how you push it to 1 side for forward then the other for reverse. I ha",1
"Title: Cannot believe 640 people gave this 4 & 5 stars!
Review: I was all set to buy the Graco Nautilus carseat, but was still wondering if Britax Frontier 85 might be better. Both carseats were not being sold in any stores for me to go and check them out, so I decided to order both and test them out. I am SO glad I did, because in comparison, the Britax was BY FAR the better seat! And believe me, I REALLY wanted to love the Graco seat. 640 people probably didn't do a side-by-side comparison of the Graco Nautilus and Britax Frontier 85.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone to pay $100 more for the Britax Frontier 85, cause you get so much more in the long run!<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />1.

Not only did the lid crack along the side so you can't have liquids to the top or it spills out everywhere, but the bottom cracked with a leak at the bottom. It’s also very difficult to open after blending so sometimes you pry the lid open and the liquid spills everywhere. Another major issue is that it does not grind up ice or  harder fruits/vegetables..total  disappointment:(",0

Review: This product had so many good reviews, and I was really hopeful. However, it was too sticky and did not absorb into my skin at all. I tried putting it on before going to bed and I literally needed to shower again in the middle of the night because I was sticking to my sheets and it was like a slime coating that would not get off my skin.

Review: I am making my own jars for home made creams for friends and family.  These molds are great for that.<br /><br />EASE OF USE<br />These are not hard to do, but the only problem is resin.  Depending on the type of resin you are using, the bubbles are very difficult to get out of the jar no matter how I try to do it.  I have tried in layers heating slightly.

"Title: Fantastic cleaning brushes for small jobs and tight spaces
Review: These brushes are fantastic for cleaning small bottles or getting into tight cleaning spaces.  The smallest brush passes through a hole the size of a dime.  All three brushes can be bent to angle them for cleaning certain square-type bottles.  What I also like is that they have nylon-type bristles all the way to about half inch before the tip and the tip is covered in soft cloth-type bristles.  This means the tip can be used for dusting without scratching. For instance, you can dust the nooks and crannies of small knickknacks or picture frames without scraching the item.  Of course, if the nook and cranny is too small, even the smallest brush won't fit but for most small jobs these are excellent brushes.  I would definitely purchase this pr",1
"Title: Not bright, strobing effect
Review: I have a hexagonal restoration hardware ceiling light fixture that I have been struggling with years with due to the limitations of the candelabra E12 base and the corresponding usual 60 watt limit on these.  I have tried numerous iterations of incadescent, CFL and LED bulbs.  I was hopeful for this one being advertised at 850 lumens but they are no brighter than the 500 lumen LED bulbs (looks like a traditional incadescent glass bulb) that I have now.  To make it worse they have a bad strobing effect when looking at moving objects and I find it hard on the eyes.  I'm still on the lookout for a better light bulb, so will try again (returned another bulb that was E12 but the screw in was not long enough to contact socket element).",0

Little over a month for me, I consider myself a casual gamer.<br /><br />There are minor issues that happened too frequently, unplugging and replugging or turning off and turning back on will usually fix.

Review: I had high hopes for this deodorant upon seeing how highly praised it was on TV and social media, but I came to the disappointing realization that this stuff works no better than a $5 tube of basic brand deodorant. As a matter of fact it works less than that! It doesn't last longer than a couple hours and I've noticed it makes my underarms and even going into the breast area extremely itchy and rashy! I've even noticed that I smell worse after it wears off than if I just choose to not wear deodorant for a day!

Each year he reluctantly leaves his ordinarily carefree life behind in London and travels north to make his required annual pilgrimage to the family estate in Yorkshire.  This year though he has particular reason even more reluctant to go, his sister has let their parents know that Philip is dating a fashion model, a revelation that is not met with much enthusiasm.  That the news of his long time relationship with Marla should surface at this point struck Phillip as a rather bitter irony since the pair had broken up just a few days earlier, and it had not been an amicable parting.

"Title: A superb evening of romantic classical music
Review: Two reviewers already have given detailed reviews of these CDs.  I wanted to add a generalized review, one focusing on ""mood.""  This is the type of album one puts on while sipping on some fine red wine and relaxing.  It is not music for a dark mood, but rather one for a ""life is good"" mood.  The orchestra is sonorous, and so are the soloists.  I want to single out Rachel Pine, who clearly is going to be much more famous than she is now.  I have heard her once live, and she has all the goods -- her technique is so good that one does not notice difficulties in the score.  And her tone is warm; there are no brittle edges anywhere.  Her violin is rather noteworthy.  Brahms specifically chose this Guarneri, the ex-Soldat, for a favorite playing ",1

Review: First, these mics work great and have a very nice quality of sound for the money. They work great for vlog. Here are the problems I have with these, the bag it came with is just too small for all the cords and mics. I feel like I will damage them if I jam them into the bag for storage. It should have been a bit bigger. And I also have an issue with the size of the alligator clips, they are huge. I personally don't want to see a mic clipped to me and I feel like these are just too big. No need for such a big clip.

The Dream events are gone and now they have &#34;Duel&#34; events, which are basically the same event with random scoring.

Review: I’m a big fan of jerky and frequently make my own, but it’s time consuming, so it’s nice to have a good option to purchase. This is tender and easy to chew. The pieces are small, not long strips. The three flavors are all good, but the teriyaki is my favorite. It has a lot of flavor without relying on a lot of spice or a lot of pepper which I often find to be the case with store-bought jerky. The packages are small, 2.5 oz each, and that equals 2.5 servings according to the nutrition information. Honestly, I think it would be easy to eat the entire bag in one sitting, but the packages are resealable if you have more self control than I do.",1

After research and comparing different types and brands, I decided to buy this Fiskars tool. It has a few drawbacks. It is large and needs more space. It has some weight to it.

Review: ""Babel"" wasn't easy to watch.  The objective wasn't to entertain.  Early on, one member of my family left the room because the reality was so intense.

These days the networks feel overly contrived and fake, which is why they are usually my last choice.<br /><br />""Babel"" was about alot of things, and it was certainly thought provoking on many levels.

Review: The material used to make the dress is horrible. It's more like the material you would use to make curtains as opposed to a dress... even the lace is thick and unattractive. The lace is not a light dainty lace for wearing rather something you'd use to make a tablecloth or something to decorate your home. Also the material used to make the botanist is loud like the swoosh swoosh windbreaker material sound (those born in the 80s will understand) so I will be returning.

The light golden background color changed to a murky brown after the first time it got rained on - and stayed that color. Doesn't look totally awful, but not as bright and pretty as when it arrived. Wouldn't buy again.<br />After a couple of more weeks, I am downwardly revising my opinion of this mat from 2 stars to 1. The murky brown color that the background turned has become even darker in color, and the mat is totally unappealing - going to the garbage.<br />Waste of money.",0
"Title: Incorrectly Auto-Deleted Videos
Review: I was very excited about this product.<br /><br />However, when the small video storage capacity was at 100% the auto-delete removed any videos over 100% PLUS @ 50% more.<br /><br />So I lost half of my videos.<br /><br />I called in to Tech Support and they were not able to recover the incorrectly auto-deleted videos.<br /><br />They also were not able to open a ticket to get the issue resolved.<br /><br />Extremely disappointing since I bought the 5pack and another.<br /><br />Decide on your own, but I would not waste my money on this if I knew better.",0
"Title: No-go with Mojave - WAIT
Review: Desperately wanted the speed for my 2018 MacBook Pro, but this little monster does not work with the latest Mojave MacOS (10.14.6 - August 2019). I saw some other reviews that warned about similar problems, but figured I could work around it as long as there somehow was a workaround. Nope. This seems to be a Samsung problem, not an Apple issue. If you are looking at this in the fall of 2019 or later, maybe they've got things cleaned up. Do your research. I am going to go cry now about the read/write speeds I'll be stuck with until that glorious day when everything truly works together out of the box ... *sad face*",0
"Title: A cool looking, functional vertical stand!
Review: This is cool looking! Don't have a use for the gamepad holders, as I prefer my Arc Charger for that ([[ASIN:B01679AQM4 TNTi&trade; Arc Charger - Xbox One Wireless Controller Charger with AC adapter]]).<br /><br />Note that when the stand's USB wire is plugged into the Xbox One console, that power is constant to the console stand, even when the Xbox One is off, and thus the fan would run all the time. Thus XFuny has added a power button at the stand's front bottom to turn off the fans, if desired. Good idea, due to dust build-up particularly, but also means that one has to remember to turn on the cooling fans when the Xbox is in use... or at least when in heavier use.<br /><br />I own 4 consoles and vertical placement is becoming a necessity",1
"Title: ""UNLUCKY ALL 7""
Review: I worked with this pedal for quite a while after it arrived today and all I can come up with is 'wow'  In surprised that a pedal with 7 different modes doesn't do Any of them particularly well....And if you can believe this,,, all the models sound the same! So...in a nutshell, the Lucky 7 doesn't do Any of the functions well at all&#34;  Its already on its way back!  I was expecting at least a couple of good sounds&#34;  nope'  if I was Forced to have to pick the best one of the 7, it would be the vibrato...That one came the closest to being at all usable....But anybody can just buy a decent vibrato pedal right....Sorry Caline....This one fails miserably.....with all due respect&#34;",0
"Title: SO FRUSTRATING!
Review: I got these to try to rid my yard of moles or gophers or whatever is leaving tunnels beneath my grass - I have tried and tried to set them.  The design is AWFUL.<br /><br />I used a grinder on one to adjust the pin in order to make it work but it still doesn’t operate properly.<br /><br />The other is hopeless. I have messed with this set now for 2 months and it is going into the trash so I never have to think about it again.<br /><br />This was a COMPLETE WASTE of my time.<br /><br />My advice is to avoid this product.  Purchase the name brand and save yourself the hassle and time.  This product is absolutely not worth purchasing and trying to make work.",0
"Title: This Bass Is AWESOME!  Donner Gives You So Much for Your Money!
Review: Let me begin by saying I'm not a bassist; in fact, I'm not even a great guitarist, but rather an enthusiast who likes to experiment in his home studio.  That being said, I purchased this for myself so I could lay down some rudimentary bass lines to glue together some song ideas ahead of someone else doing the real work, so take my comments in that context.<br /><br />I have to say, I LOVE this bass!  As an owner of 3 other guitars, I CAN recognize good build quality and this certainly exemplifies that.  There isn't a single blemish on this thing--it's shiny, slick and pretty.  It's also SOLID, but not overly heavy.  I'd guess it weighs about 7 or 8 freedom units (pounds) and its center of gravity is probably about the fourth fret from the e",1
"Title: Cheap quality
Review: I ordered these shirts for a 12 year old boy. The shorts were a little bit larger than expected after ordering the “appropriate size”. The zipper on the back pocket was broke when it arrived. The hem around the waist band started to fray and unravel after 3 hours of wearing, and the back side of the shorts had snags in the fabric. The inside pocket for holding a phone for running or exercising was the reason for even buying these shorts and that worked functional but with all the other issues I would not buy again and the reason for only 1 star. Made very cheaply but did arrive very quick",0
"Title: Second bottle of this serum
Review: Hyaluronic acid is awesome for your skin. If you don't believe me, then literally look it up. WebMD will state that it helps with joint disorders, eye surgeries, and healing wounds/burns and more.<br /><br />The big statement here really is that it's very effective for any sort of regenerative properties. The serum is a very good moisturizer, and don't let the word &#34;acid&#34; turn you off of it. It's actually found in high quantities in the skin of a baby, which everyone knows is incredibly soft.<br /><br />This product, applied to your face, will protect it from UV damage, improve elasticity, make your face feel softer, and properly moisturize it.<br /><br />I have ben using products by Derma- nu for a while and this is my second buy o",1
"Title: Another old toy ruined by moden cheap quality
Review: My daughter had played with the fashion plates from the 80s and loved them.  So I purchased this new set for her.  Her first results were completely blurry and I told her she needed to keep the paper still while she rubbed.  Time after time, it came out the same - horrible.  So the adults stepped in and didn't get any better results.  1) the design doesn't allow you to keep the paper still and 2) even if you did, the plates are so shallow and cheap that your drawings will be blurry messes.  Too bad to even color in.  Where is the fun in this?<br /><br />Melissa & Doug was a quality brand, so I thought.  I will think twice before buying another of their products.<br /><br />Attention companies - make products better and charge a little more!",0
"Title: Excellent collection of well-recorded pipe band music
Review: There isn't any filler in this 2CD collection.  From beginning to end on both CDs, your heart quickens at the fast melodies and drum beats.  It includes a good mix of different styles of pipe band music, slow airs and boisterous marches, as well as good renditions of well known pieces such as ""Scotland the Brave"", ""Auld Lang Syne"", ""Amazing Grace"" and others.  It is one of the best sounding recordings I've heard as well - other recordings sound hollow or tinny (and you wonder why so many people think they can't stand bagpipes, when bagpipes actually play very beautiful music).<br /><br />This makes great listening music to keep you peppy while working, and you will find that the CDs go by fast.  The album became one of my favorites in only ",1
"Title: Great brush drying rack!
Review: My makeup brush tree came exactly on time in 1 week.  The item came packaged in bubble wrap and was undamaged during shipment.  Each acrylic piece had a protective film on it that you have to peel off.  The film is pretty thin and I had to use my nail to kind of lift if off at the corner to peel.  It was easy to assemble and pretty sturdy/balanced, even with my makeup brushes in them.  They held my makeup brushes, both large handled and the skinny eye brushes, pretty securely.  After washing my brushes, I would slide them in from underneath as to not damage the bristles.  When dried, I just pulled them out from the top.  Only brushes I didn't pull from the top were unique shaped ones like a fan brush.  Having this brush tree keeps the water",1
"Title: A must have for chess fans on the go
Review: This is the smallest board I have seen.  It sits in a wallet, in a jacket pocket.  It's the kind of board you can use to study on the subway or on a bus, or to have a game while on an airplane. It's the go anywhere chess board.<br /><br />The little flap on the side seemed strange, but it turns out it's a good place to store captured pieces.  I would have turned the board sideways, in that the letters and numbers would swap sides, so that the flap could be equally accessible to both sides, but that's nit picking. Certainly if you either know algebraic notation well, or if you don't care, then you can turn the board anyway.<br /><br />It unfolds well and lays flat.  The pieces hold well, even when the board is jostled or knocked around.",1
"Title: Comfortable and has different sizes!!
Review: I love love these! I bought these as we have 4 kids who are all home remote learning plus and hubby working from home! these are great as when the kids are playing loudly I can wear these (STILL HEARING THEM) but it ""dims"" that noise so that I can still have a conversation with the hubby. I highly recommend these for children who have auditory or sensory issues. I was becoming super overwhelmed with all the noise in my house from zoom calls all at once, these allow me to still hear what is going on but not so loudly that I become frustrated and overwhelmed.<br />It also came with multiple sizes and the case is great!",1

"Title: Slow, Boring and Stupid
Review: I'm thankful I only wasted $4.00 to rent this movie rather than more money to see it at the theatre or buy it. The pace was SO SLOW - I thought the movie would never end. Very dull. Characters not well developed - I didn't find myself caring what happened to any of them. Granted, I may have missed a little something as I fast-forwarded through the last 45 minutes (didn't want to completely waste my money - I at least wanted to be able to feel like I tried), but from what I saw, it was highly disappointing and just a poorly revamped version of many other better movies.",0
"Title: Tiny tender mussels with a LOT of smoky taste!
Review: I bought these to mix in with spaghetti and butter which worked well (for one person you only need to use 2 maybe 3 tins).<br /><br />The mussels were tiny but they were very tender and had a smoky flavor as described which leads to why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars for the flavor. To me they had a little too much smoky flavor than what I prefer But if you like smoked mussels with a lot of smoky taste, then these would be great for you I’m sure.<br /><br />Since I bought 6 tins of them, the next time I use them I’m going to try and give them a good rinse to see if I can lessen the smoky taste.<br /><br />Overall I’m happy with my purchase I just wished they’d use a little less smoke flavor. For that reason alone I’m not going to pu",1
"Title: Cool title, too bad about the nonsense content
Review: Let me spoil the surprise.  The scarecrow scares away a robin about to eat the spider.  The spider scares away some boys who are trying to tear apart the scarecrow.  Apparently, the scarecrow only walks around and talks in the presence of non-humans, but this not fully clear.  Both scarecrow and spider then ruminate how great it was that god made the world this way.  I do have a few questions: (1) is it wrong for birds to eat insects generally, or for people to eat birds, or the multitudinous kinds of predation that exists all around us?; (2) wouldn't it have been easier for god to save all creatures, than this preposterous turn of events?  At least god could have stopped the boys from being so mean; (3) wouldn't god's direct intervention h",0
"Title: Humble Pie on Audible
Review: I have to admit I tried Audible because of the free offer to try Gordon Ramsay's Humble Pie.  I am already a fan of Gordon Ramsay and was interested in hearing his 'biography'.  I truly loved it. I listened to the book in my car via my Droid (Audible App), which kept me engaged on long trips.  My only hesitation in purchasing more books is the price. I find the audio books to be a bit pricey for routine purchase, but I understand the reasons for that - likely having to do with the narration and recording processes.",1

"Title: piece of garbage, wouldnt stay plugged in and kept falling out. Cheaply made and junk..returned it
Review: I had done my research and went with this unit which seemed like the best choice. For starters the plug is a two prong plug which plugs into the rear of this unit and it would not stay plugged in. It was kept falling out and the so called wireless charger in front never would work..I had to keep moving my iPhone around to get it to recognize it. After days of playing around with trying to get this to work, I returned it since it is the most expensive unit out there and it doesnt even include cables.

"Title: The watercolor markers are horrible
Review: You need to register online to get the full directions and videos that go with this kit.  It is free with a code you receive in the kit.  The drawing pad is a nice size and thick paper.  The colored pencils and water colors all work as expected.  This is my second course with them and I was not very successful with this as I was with the other one.  I don't think it has as much explanation as is course 1.  The round watercolor brush broke and the watercolor brush markers did not spread out with water as they are supposed to.  The red one stopped working all together.  I became very frustrated at the end as anything I had done was now ruined.",0
"Title: Not for me
Review: This was an odd read for me.<br />It didn’t resonate remotely like I was hoping.<br /><br />It’s decently written in a devotional format, and for 8w7’s may feel very accurate. As an 8w9 I didn’t to relate more than a handful of chapters.<br /><br />I was very ((very)) thrown by the overt Christian messaging. That’s my fault because I didn’t pay close enough attention to the details on the ‘about’ page.<br /><br />It’s great for many, but I had no idea religion was going to be the flavor we were seasoning this with. Was expecting more practical and psychological thoughts.<br />I grew up in a yucky form of fundamentalism and the last thing I want to read about, is “my enneagram number” with religious overtures about God peppered into every ch",0
"Title: Good for what it is
Review: For those of you familiar with Hyaluronic Acid Serum, you know how well this works.  For those of you who are not familiar with it, I would be hesitant to say that Hyaluronic Acid is a go to miracle solution for wrinkles.  It will temporarily reduce them I find, but that's good enough for me.  I tend to use these on days where I've had late nights or need an extra bit of a touch up.  If you haven't tried it before, I'd give it a go to see what you think but for me, it's one of those essentials I keep on hand.",1
"Title: Read the Ingredients...low grade meat, lots of fillers, and high in hidden sugar!
Review: If you scour the ingredients of Blackwood's various dry dog foods, you'll quickly see that whole meats aren't included in the first several ingredients.  For example, ""chicken meal"" as the primary ingredient is not the same as actual ""chicken"".  Any meat name followed by the word ""meal"" means a much lower grade product and can include things like organ meats and cartilage.  Furthermore, rice is a filler, as are things like barley and oats.  These add bulk, but offer poor nutritional value and are essentially empty calories for your dog.  Additionally, some of the top ingredients like beet pulp (which comes from sugar beets, NOT the same beets most of us buy at the grocery store) and sorghum are hidden sources of sugar.  These ingredients re",0

Review: I ordered this to replace the same model that turned up dead the other day.  I knew the memory was small, but when I went to load the new maps, and they are FREE, I found that they won't fit.  Ah, you say, simply remove the old maps and put on the new.  Well, surprise, the memory is so small it won't fit.  Get a memory card you say, I know, BUT there is no memory slot.  Tom Tom even tried to sell me a Memory Card knowing the VIA 1505M has no ability to take a memory card.  I didn't know the latest maps were not on the device.

"Title: Do not buy this stroller. Seriously. It’s awful and so cheap.
Review: I love the ergo carriers. I was very excited to receive the 180 stroller as a gift for my shower for my 3rd baby. However, it has been an incredibly bad experience. The toggles that you pull up on to reverse the handle bar are basically impossible to engage. There is no way I can do it alone (one person has to do one and another person the other, at the exact same time). The back wheels already are wobbly and hit the break. And while folding it is easy, getting it unfolded is next to impossible. The little tiny button that you have to press simultaneous with lifting the handle bar up only works some of the time. I was left standing on the street in the pouring rain holding my baby and trying to get it to work. I almost just abandoned the st",0
"Title: Two very enjoyable yoga practices for morning and evening
Review: I've been interested in this DVD for some time, as it's one of the few routines on video taught by an Anusara Yoga-trained instructor.  This DVD is led by Elena Brower, a senior Anusara instructor at the time that this video was filmed.  She is featured alone here, instructing via voiceover in a beautiful flowered garden overlooking the Pacific that is the standard setting for most of the Element DVDs I have tried.<br /><br />As the title would suggest, ELEMENT AM & PM YOGA FOR BEGINNERS offers two routines, one for morning and one for evening.  Both are quite gentle, and both would be appropriate for MOST beginners, but I always believe that some prior experience and familiarity with yoga is helpful before using a DVD.

Review: Really like the way the game actually makes you feel immersed in the game. Handsets are much better than expected. People of all ages among our family and friends have enjoyed it. Even fun to watch other people play it when you cast the game to a TV. Downfalls are field of vision maybe not as good as it can be, and necessity to buy a separate “face cover” for the headset to make it easier to clean (some games make the player quite sweaty) and fit more snugly. Overall, very pleased with the Oculus. Great activity when family and friends over, or to take other places!",1

Review: This is a great Fountain Pen! I bought it to use for pen and ink drawings with watercolor.<br />I love how much ink it holds compared to some of my other pens.<br />I love that the inside mechanism that draws the ink in is made of metal and not plastic.<br />I also love that it is clear and I can easily see what color in I have in it.<br />It writes and draws very nicely without skipping.<br />I also love the extra fine nib.

Review: 04/28/2016-UPDATE: I just received my 5th order of this mask in 5 months and while I still like it very much, the formulation has changed from a lovely light serum gel to a more watery, less slickery one. With the other boxes, there was still an abundance of serum on my face after wearing for 20-25 mins to massage in along with my finishing serum. Now its dry in places after that time has elapsed. I hope the next box is the old formula.<br />06/10/2016-UPDATE: 6th order is the same watery texture but a new addition is a medicinal, Mercurochrome smell. Very odd.

"Title: Pretty damn good for the price
Review: Like many others around the world, the stay at home mandate forced my wife and me to work from home indefinitely. We only have tall tables in our small apartment so we needed tall office chairs to help with our aching backs. These inexpensive chairs were pretty good at filling that need! They're extremely easy to assemble, sturdy, and mostly comfortable. We're both 5'4'' and slim so these aren't quite perfectly ergonomic as they seem to be better fitted (like most other office chairs) to taller and wider people. But hey, for the price and style these are exactly what we needed!",1

Review: This little lamp figure, between 4 and 5 inches tall, seems to be in the spirit of vinyl toy collectibles, Funko, Michael Lau, etc. In my photos, you'll see I'm holding it next to my Michael Lau collection. They are going to fit right in next to the gang. LOL! The head is magnetic and easily removable. The tin case is cool, and as a toy collector, I like this a lot. If you're not a vinyl figure collector, and you're actually looking for a lamp, this is too small. I would not let my kids read with such a tiny light. I can see how this wouldn't be 5-Stars for someone looking for a lamp, but this is 5-Stars because we like toys! LOL!",1
"Title: My Heart was in a Million little pieces!
Review: I intentionally did not read this book following the Frey/Oprah scandal. I waited a couple of years and then read the book, how I think it should be read with no anticipation or expectation that the story is true or Frey's life story, but simply as a story. With that being said, I really enjoyed ""A Million Little Pieces"". The story relates the tremendous journey towards recovery for James Frey.<br /><br />The story begins with James waking up on a plane with no idea where he has been or what he has done. What he does know is that he is missing several teeth, covered in urine, throw-up and blood, and obviously in a lot of trouble. Taken to a rehab facility by his family, we see James attempt to understand why he has done some of the things t",1
"Title: Comfortable, easily adjustable, very easy to put on.
Review: I have bursitis of the elbow and will be seeing a doctor in the near future. Appointments aren't immediate where I live.<br /><br />I had been wearing an ACE bandage to try to protect my elbow. It wasn't padded, so it did a poor job of protection. It also caused some discomfort putting pressure on the swelling. It also tended to slip down my arm requiring constant adjustment.<br /><br />This Corflex product had none of these issues.<br /><br />It is amazingly easy to install using only one hand. There are two velcro straps which loop through two 'belt buckles'.

Review: I picked up a bass guitar about 8 years ago, from a police auction, and it has been standing in a corner until last week.  I have no experience with playing a musical instrument at all.  My bass is not in good condition, and probably can't be brought back to what anyone would consider to be even &#34;fair&#34; condition.  It had round wound strings on it when I got it, of unknown brand, and they were killing my fingers.  I had no base knowledge with which to purchase new strings and pretty much just used the SWAG method.  I got these new strings on with no problem whatsoever.<br /><br />What a relief they are.  They sound warm and mellow, as advertised, and are really easy on my fingers.  I have been able to put in a decent amount of practi",1
"Title: Nice game...
Review: I'm not a gigantic Harry Potter maniac ...but I must say the game is good. The 3d graphics are very impressive, good music and easy-to-remember-controls: ctrl, alt, and arrow keys. But the end of the game is sort of shocking; the end shows Harry in the Great Hall with lots of other people clapping, and then the credits start rolling. And you think, ""Oh. It's over."" And then you just sit there and stare at the screen.<br />But the game is SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE. The mouths move, Harry automaticlly follows the Snitch, the spells are easier to learn and there is more of Hogwarts to explore.<br />You can also use your beans once you find them. You can trade them for cool stuff. The characters are humorus and fit in with the game. But",1
"Title: For classic and natural
Review: These are only for both the classic and natural bottle. I haven't tried the natural style so I can't offer anything on the use of these disc and that bottle style. For the classic, replace the nipple in the screw ring with the disk. It should fit snugly and click or pop when in place. I suggest doing a test run on the disc with water to make sure that they are in place properly. As with the classic, the adapter ring must be in use in order to prevent leakage. I bought extra screw rings myself to make switching from nipple to disc much easier to do while being on the go. Over all, these are a great buy for any mom whose nursing and want to pump directly into the bottle and store.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/5/2017<br />I've now has these sealing dis",1

Review: They don’t work. I tested them on a painted steel door - to pull them straight off took maybe 10lb of pull ... but they just slid right down when anything was hooked on the hooks. So no 100lbs of anything. Maybe a pot holder or calendar would hang, but the magnet easily slid down the door with any small weight. Also even tho it says “free returns” - I got “item contains combustible materials/ not returnable” and “outside return window” (which it isn’t bc I just received it today) On unpainted steel they stuck better but that needs to be stated bc all<br />my steel doors are painted.

"Title: Really shouldn't have spent money on this before giving it a test run!
Review: My bad.  I spent 3.99 to have the ads removed (and get more puzzles, I think?) before spending any real time trying the app out.  Turns out I STILL see ads.  Also, the progress I make on puzzles I leave and come back to later is not reliably saved.  At first, I thought it was just me doing something wrong, but I see I'm not alone in this, and that sort of bug is just plain unacceptable.  I HOPE the devs actually care and will fix the app, and if they do, I'll change my review accordingly.  At this point, though, I fear all they care about is the money they got from me already.  Downside for them it's that I won't be buying any more of their apps unless/until they fix this one.",0
"Title: Incomplete test kit, no refunds accepted
Review: I’ve used several of these test kits. One arrived missing the test cards in foil packets. Since there’s no refund allowed, it was money wasted with no recourse. Now I can’t trust the brand and will switch to another brand.<br /><br />Editing to add:<br /><br />Since the overall rating was high, I didn’t read the 1-star reviews at first. Now I have, and can see that I am by no means alone in getting a defective kit. The phone number to the lab doesn’t take messages (“full voice mailbox”), so it’s not easy to report the defective kit’s batch number. I’m disappointed that this seller is still permitted to sell, with so many defective kits, no refunds on defective products, and sketchy batch reporting availability.",0

Review: Update: About eight months in, started getting a lot of crackling coming through, so that it became virtually unusable.  I emailed Moukey about it, but they never returned any of my emails.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />I purchased this microphone for my vlogging, as an upgrade over my iPhone's built-in mic.  I had debated a USB mic,  but since I already had a USB audio interface with for my guitar, I figured that an XLR mic would be better (they have far better sound quality than USB mics) and it could plug directly into my interface.<br /><br />This microphone was a huge improvement and worked great.

It help keep my open-front cardigans in place without slipping to the sides as they usually do, especially if wearing a slippery type blouse underneath.  I was a bit concerned that the clips wouldn't grip firmly enough, but they stay on fine.

"Title: Virtually painless, year after year.
Review: Of course the pain comes from having to do taxes in the first place, especially as a small business owner, but this software is WAY cheaper than paying an accountant to do them for you and you are walked through the entire process. It is all about your record keeping and data entry, and if you are meticulous all year, then it doesn't take long at all. I am using this for my small business and it took me less than an hour to input the data, review it and complete. The software is simple to install and use with the guide and I will happily use this again next year.",1
"Title: Attractive dress
Review: This was a nice tropical print.<br /><br />This is a cute dress. I liked it. I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was pretty good. I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since I live in Florida.<br /><br />It wasn't too hard to clean. I thought it seemed trendy. It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it.",1
"Title: Easy and fun!
Review: As a senior citizen with a few problems with balance and confidence, the Wii Fit Plus with Balance Board is just the ticket!  Easy to set up, with a wide (and funny) choice of avatars, and the sounds are pleasant and not annoying as so many games can be. The games are challenging, but doable with practice, which brings improvement without becoming too easy for fun, and can really work up a sweat.  A fitness counter keeps track of time and effort spent in the game, though I would say that this can become a bit tedious - probably that could be shut off, but have not bothered to figure it out yet.  In the few months I've had this game I can already see some improvement in my balance confidence, which was the initial reason to buy it.  I'd defi",1
"Title: Windows 10 Driver Issues - DO NOT BUY
Review: If you're using Windows 10 and intend on using this for any extended period of time, AVOID purchasing this product. Currently, I can't go any longer than 3 hours without my audio interface resulting in me sounding like a robot. I've contacted support multiple times and they've tried to be helpful, but it doesn't seem like there's any end in sight for this problem. I wish I had researched the Solo prior to purchasing considering it's a very well known issue. To clarify, there's nothing wrong with the interface itself, but the drivers are not working the way they should. I was using this to connect my AT2020 to my PC for streaming alongside VOIP chatting (Discord/Teamspeak/Skype) and it has been 6 months of continuous unplugging and repluggin",0
"Title: Best Wax
Review: I have used many waxes and this is the best....by far.  When they raised the price, though the roof, I said I wasn't going to buy this stuff anymore.  I still am though.<br /><br />Excellent deep shine especially on dark colors.  Pretty good durability....an order of magnitude better than most boutique waxes.  Ease of application is great.  The BEST thing about this wax, save for the deep shine, is that it WILL NOT STAIN TRIM.  You can (and I do) wax your trim with this wax.  It does not stain under any circumstances.  Many waxes will stain badly with a residue that is really hard to remove, but this stuff will not.  It makes trim look great, as a matter of fact.<br /><br />I have tried MANY waxes over the years.  This is the best.  Hands d",1
"Title: Really wanted to love this BUT….no
Review: I was really excited for this product. I had watched a few reviews and knew I need something like this in my life to make cleaning easier. Boy was I disappointed with this particular item. I set up the brush as instructed, charged it up and proceeded to try to use it in my bathroom. As soon as the brush touched the actual tile, the spinning brush head would slow all the way down but once lifted in the air, it would return to its normal spinning speed. I thought I needed to charge it some more so I did and tried the brush the following week. Same issues. I tried a few more times and got the same result. Highly disappointed and unfortunately cannot return.",0
"Title: Not Bright at all!
Review: Unfortunately these lights are nowhere near what I thought I was buying. It would take 8 of them just to equal the 2 LED shop lights I got from Costco 3 years ago. I would literally need 12 more lights to the addition of the 12 that I bought to light my new shop area. I will be needing to return them for a refund.<br />These lights are probably better for under cabinets or closets. Basically if you need to have glowing LED lights that Don't fill a room these might work for you. Hopefully this helps anyone who is trying to decide if these lights are for them.",0
"Title: Very nice
Review: I'm real surprised by other reviews that complain about the bracelet and the sizing, they ask you what size it is so you can have it fit an adult so how can you go wrong? Now, besides that mine were perfect, sized correctly, I had one or two small questions and they contacted me and discuss things and I could not be happier. Both my sons do not like jewelry and like to fish, this is the perfect thing for someone like that. They both love it and it reflects their passion for fishing with the hooks. Again, highly recommend.",1
"Title: Worked for about 3 weeks
Review: This worked great for 3 weeks and now it won't shut off. I don't know about anyone else, but I am sick to death of cheap, one season, EXPENSIVE, disposable merchandise.<br /><br />I have 4 water timers I run every summer. I take them all in in the fall before the snow flies. I remove all the old batteries and store them indoors. This year I have had to replace 3 timers and none of them were inexpensive and all of them were new last summer.. If I were paying $9.99 for these pieces of junk, I wouldn't be so angry, but that is not the case. $40 dollars here...$60.00 there adds up to a lot of money when you're using 4 timers. Do they even make a reliable water timer anymore?<br /><br />I use to buy Ace Hardware timers and they lasted for years ",0
"Title: What a waste
Review: I read the reviews here and various other locations and waited for the release before considering buy this game. Luckily, there is a demo version that you can try and I did. All the reviews are correct. DS3 isn't anywhere close to the previous two. Controls are a joke. Obsidian did to the DS3 what EA did to the Command & Conquer 4, totally FUBARed it. I would definitely try the demo before wasting $50. I'll wait til this hits under $20 like I did before wasting $20 on C&C4. It will be there in about 4-6 months when it doesn't sell unless the company can seriously patch this game to be more like a PC game and follow the DS series.",0

I could not read any date code and offered to send them back to the factory for examination.

"Title: Don't Buy It!
Review: After reading all the wonderful reviews for this product, I was greatly disappointed. First, they are not easy to put on. Little bubbles are bound to pop up and that magical stupid squeegee thing does not help much if at all for the little bubbles. But my biggest complaint are those stupid little labels that are supposed to just peel right off. They don't they leave this horrible goop on the top of the screen that doesn't come off! These screen protectors are a giant waste of money, time and effort. Thankfully they didn't cost much money.",0
"Title: Stunningly bad quality for brand associated product
Review: I ordered this wig because it was a Lord of the Rings official brand product and yet what arrived was the cheapest quality wig I have yet purchased. This wig couldn't be thinner and in fact has bare patches that can't be covered. It arrived with two hair nets both torn wide open so that the wig has nothing to contain or protect it. Consequently, it arrived in a completely rumpled and unfixable state. When I tried it on I noticed the part of the wig that is designed to be in front laying in front of your shoulders one side is very much shorter than the other. The rest of the hair that falls down the back is much shorter than the front part. Just a weird design and the lack of fullness makes it ridiculous to wear. I'm returning mine and I wou",0
"Title: elegant fan
Review: This is basically what we expected and wanted - a Hunter fan with remote that has lights which will help cool off a large, open area. It's something a little different with the lights (the 'jar' look), but it looks great installed and stands out in such a large space (living/family room/kitchen/eating area). It definitely provides enough power on high speed to cool off the space, which is great in the warmer weather and to help with cooking.<br />We have canister lights, so the family electrician (my dad) needed about two hours to install this - out of the three Hunter fans we've added to the house in the past year or so, this one probably required the most time, and not just because of the light fixture. There was a guard which had to be r",1
"Title: Big Disappointment - Not as Pictured
Review: Disappointed. It's not the ""slouchy"" material as stated or looks like in image. Not tapered. It's that heavy weighted silky stuff that body suits are typically made of. Not light weight at all. Also, in pictures you see a thick cute spaghetti strap, when you get it's just the boring typical spaghetti straps. Also seam thread visible. Just not at all like pictures.<br /><br />Also, I believed the comments that it runs small, it runs on size or larger. I ordered ""true to size"" according to size chart and it's definitely too big.",0
"Title: Disappointing for everyone
Review: I purchased the entire series for my daughter, which I now regret.  Fortunately she is college-age, as it is not for younger viewers, and it is not a shining example of romance.  The animation is sometimes very hard to follow.  The main character is a hypocrite, and she is very egotistical and deceitful, but changes for the better, to a degree, over time.<br /><br />The series starts out like a teen girl soap opera, starts to become a love story, but then slowly crashes.  In the end though, the girl (Yukino Miyazawa) seems to learn more about life and makes real friends, but by this time, we just don't care.<br /><br />At first I really did not like the character, I don't think we are meant to.  She meets a boy (Soichiro Arima) with a tragi",0
"Title: I want my 19yr old broken oreck back!
Review: After owning an oreck XL for 19 years I can’t believe I am saying I hate this replacement model. It’s cheaper quality, harder to push, no light and most of all I hate the cord. It’s like adding an extension cord with a weird dangling cord lock that serves no purpose other than eliminating cord hooks for storage when not in use. The one cord hook doesn’t hold the gathered 40 ft cord for storage and I am not using a twisty tie every time I want to store the cord dangling from the cord lock. A few amazon review photos show the people gather the cord and place it around the handle which works as long as you don’t mind tangled cord.  I wanted the purple “swivel” oreck vacuum for $40 more which has more power, a light, a hepa filter, a self Prope",0
"Title: Dollar store product
Review: It is so hard to evaluate the quality of a product from a picture.  I was looking for a cushion cover that was beaded and had a combination of gold and silver and this product seemed to have all the features I was looking for.  First of all let me say that this could have been shipped in a padded envelope because it is very light and thin but it arrived in a large cardboard box filled with plastic bubble wrap.  I appreciate the effort to protect the product but it is really a waste of materials.  The box and wrapping is worth more than the product itself.  As soon as I picked it out of the box my first thought was: &#34;I can't believe I paid $14.99 for this.  I've seen these at the Dollar Store!&#34;  For some reason I thought this would h",0

Well unfortunately our korean market burned down a few years ago and they never rebuilt. I was so happy to see this online and bought some for stocking stuffers for Christmas. Instantly starting crying after eating one because it's our first Christmas without our grandmother. I will always love this candy and have amazing memories.<br /><br />For anyone that doesn't know.

"Title: Good Masks
Review: Wore this Titan Protect Class 1 protective face mask two days ago to get my hair cut. Both myself and my hairdresser have had Covid and we both wear face masks. I really have more peace of mind wearing this 3-layer disposable face mask because I can throw it away once I'm home and hopefully didn't bring it home with me. My husband and I both have had Covid and probably won't get it again but we've heard you can get it again. I hope they're wrong about that, but we've been wearing our masks as a precaution to everyone. I didn't have any problems with this face mask. It fits me perfectly and lasted many hours while I was in public doing my errands. Good masks!",1

The leather and craftsmanship on this item is fantastic, and I could not be happier. It is snug fit for my Strawberry Latte Mega Weeks, which is what I was hoping for (no sliding around). I also have a Tomoe River thin notebook in the front pocket. With my Weeks and notebook and a pen (in the loop), the snap still closes easily. So happy with this purchase. Thank you!",1
"Title: Traceable and sustainable, I'm HOOKED!
Review: When I first popped the top on the first can of tuna, I was disappointed because it looked as if it might be all the little tiny flakes. But don't worry, every can I've opened has been a good mix of small flakes as well as big chunks. That makes this tuna suitable for anything from tuna salad to eating right out of the can, something that I often do.<br />It's so mild and delicious. It's also a reminder of how heavily salted most tuna is, probably to cover up the fact that it doesn't taste as fresh as it could.<br />You'll swear that you're sitting on the boat!<br /><br />This tuna is wild caught by pole and line, something that is important to me.<br />Even my little dog, who is the pickiest eater you could imagine, begged for a little bit",1
"Title: This is a great idea, but it came up short.
Review: The very first time I opened the magnetic liner (which was the same day it arrive at my house) it was completely dry, sticky, and clumpy; and the applicator brush was roughed up. It took a lot of effort to smear the thick product onto my lid and it did not look pretty. The lashes are honestly too long and somehow, both too sparse and too heavy looking. The only pro, is that they did stay on for several hours. But for the second application, the product was simply too dry to come out if the container and it could not be used again after the first attempt.",0
"Title: The Type of Preaching We Need Desperately in our Contemporary Pulpits
Review: ""We either believe in God's wisdom and revelation or else we submit to the wisdom and philosophy of man."" ~ pg. 31<br /><br />As I was reading this wonderful book of nine sermons a storm rolled in and there was plenty of thunder and lightning. Could God have been saying hello? It sort of set a mood for the type of preaching I was about to experience. It is one thing to hear a sermon. It is quite another to read a sermon. I feel I retain more of the message by reading. That said, I completely enjoyed reading Martyn Lloyd Jones' sermons. This is the type of preaching that we need desperately in our contemporary pulpits.<br /><br />Martyn Lloyd Jones points out profound truths all while being very entertaining in a spiritual way. It is a joy t",1

Review: I'm really not sure where to start or end with these.<br /><br />These gloves are terrible.<br />This purchase was terrible.<br /><br />2 years ago I purchased these in black and these are no longer the same quality gloves.

"Title: Crows Too Low
Review: Soft and easy to blow out of the box.  Problem is it crowed at ~G5-G4 instead of C6-C5.  This is why one evaluator's musician couldn't play the high notes.  Compounding the problem the reed is just slightly shorter than 70mm so there's not a lot of room to trim the reed shorter, which is required in order to correct the pitch.<br /><br />I shortened the reed to raise the crow pitch to a ~B5-B4, and shaved the corners a bit.  Letting it dry overnight now and will probably work on it some more, but I'm not expecting great improvements.  Bear in mind as you shorten the reed it becomes harder to play -- not good for a student.  The reed should crow C6-C5 out of the box and be easy to play.<br /><br />I bought two of these reeds.  I will report ",0

You really need to order a sky and water vehicle as well as the included land vehicle so you can play most of the levels.

Review: Tentatively 5 stars for now.  This thing is HUGE!  I guess I should have read the specs better because this can hold more herbs, flowers or whatever than I could ever grow.  It seems well made but I wouldn't put much heavy stuff in there like potatoes - just lighter weight stuff.  You could put potatoes in it just as long as it's not all loaded up with them because that would be too much weight and this is made for light-weight drying.  I like how it can be hung outside and the mesh keeps all the bugs away!  Being black too will cause it to absorb more heat and dry the stuff inside faster.  I've used an electric dehydrator for years inside my house and this is the first time I've ever tried drying stuff outside.",1

Review: I purchased this item to replace the same type of item that I have used for many years but the head cushion on my first one was wearing out and I did not know how to get a replacement head cushion.  This item I just purchased has a bigger metal frame than my previous unit making it impossible to use unless perhaps if you were a larger person.  There are no adjustments that can be made on the metal frame to correct this problem.  This means I just threw away the money in order to buy the replacement and since I have already assembled this new item I will not be able to return it without considerable difficulty so the replacement will end up in the trash.  Buyer beware.  Look elsewhere.",0
"Title: Like PCs? BUY THIS MAGAZINE!
Review: I hate to spend money on information and news magazines. Why do that when I can just read stuff online? This magazine is why. It is the ONLY magazine I have subscribed to in at least 10 years and it's the only one I will always keep. I get giddy when I open the mailbox and see it sitting there. i take it out and make sure the mail carrier took good care of it.<br /><br />The information is current and somehow, in some cases, ahead of the curve. I read this thing cover to cover more than once. The articles are informative. The reviews are honest and current.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many times I've got up from the couch while reading this mag and took it to my computer because there were just too many things I had to look at online th",1
"Title: Support is excellent - on second thought, maybe not.
Review: I can't rate the endoscope itself as I had difficulty with the Wifi box not generating a WiFi signal to connect to my phone.  I used a chat session to contact DBPower, and after describing the situation, Edward processed a replacement of my unit, without my having to go through any red tape.<br />UPDATE:<br />Eleven days later, I had not received the replacement endoscope, so I started another chat session.  Mark said that their system was having issues, so he couldn't check the tracking number.  He said that he would send me an email with the status within 24 to 48 business hours.  After waiting 72 hours, I returned the endoscope to Amazon.<br />So, the bottom line for me was a defective product and promises from support that were never fu",0
"Title: Does not heat as described. Humidity in 40% range not 10-15%
Review: I had read another review that someone made with the same problem.  When I felt the container after 5+ hours of being on it was barely warm.  I added an internal temp and humidity reader to verify. Even with it turned all the way up to 55C it got only up to 39.9 and the humidity reading was 44% not under 15% where it should have been, I even tried another thermometer and humidity reader. Same thing. It could just be a defective model, but that is at least two now with the same issue.  If you own one of these or are planning on getting one, verify the temp and humidity levels. It may not be working as it is supposed to. I am returning and trying another manufacturer.  Good Luck!",0
"Title: If you're not using it for ""Slime"", then Elmer's Glue Sticks may be a better option - Made in China.
Review: Note that instructions are not sent with this product on how to make slime.  There is a recipe / instructions on this listing though, or you can look online.<br /><br />If you’re going to use this glue. . . . for glue (and  not slime), it’s rather on the “thin” side.  But it doesn’t require much.  It may be better / easier / less messy to use Elmer’s Glue Sticks.  If colors are your thing, they even have purple glue sticks.  See the link below.  If you do a search for Elmer’s Glue Sticks, you’ll find lots of options.<br /><br />This item is Made in China.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B074MPDDRD Elmer's School Glue Sticks 5ct - Disappearing Purple]]",1
"Title: customer support lacking...
Review: If you want a pan and tilt baby monitor this is the only one that I have found with halfway decent reviews... it's true that it doesn't pan down very far so you have to make some mounting adjustments to make it functional...  I am not satisfied with their customer support... I have NEVER had my phone call answered by a person... I get a recording stating their Pacific Time hours and a promise to return your call within 24 hours or email you if you can't be reached... They did not call me back within 24 hours or email me...

Review: Friedrich will look for any excuse to weasel-out of honoring their warranty.<br /><br />They tried to say it was void because I was no original purchaser. When I point out there is no such language in the warranty, and provide original proof of purchase from original owner, they then try to say it is void because I moved the PORTABLE air conditioner to my apartment when I bought it from original owner.

"Title: Weed Eater 952711557 0.080-Inch by 2000-Foot Bulk String Trimmer Line Premium 5 Edge
Review: I think I will have trimmer line forever with this purchase of Weed Eater 952711557 0.080-Inch by 2000-Foot Bulk String Trimmer Line Premium 5 Edge, since it holds up so much better than the 0.065 thick line I've been using in my B&Decker trimmer.  May go thru several trimmers before I will ever have to buy more.  If you are struggling with line that breaks too often, then get a roll of this line, but a smaller roll may suit your needs better.  It holds up very well when in use.  Wind in the right direction on the trimmer spool!",1
"Title: Pearlescent Tress Tamers! 👧🏼
Review: These little claw clips have such a fun pearlescent sheen to them, and I think they’d be appropriate for all ages! The spring-loaded mechanisms are very strong and secure, providing a reliable hold every time, and I love the pearlescent color variety present throughout the set: pink, blue, tortoiseshell, lilac, coral, white, and multi! I’ve had absolutely no issues or concerns with the functionality of these little clips, and I’d gladly gift them or recommend them to others! They work great on dry or wet hair, and they are pretty enough to leave out (displayed in a bowl), so they’re really quite versatile too!",1
"Title: Sloppy work.
Review: I ordered this as a photo prop for a wedding. The product is poor quality.  The decal was creased all over and applied to the board unevenly.  The ends were dented too. Creases thorough the picture even which is the focal point. I contacted the company weeks ago and they said they would send another one. Now the wedding is tomorrow and it still hasn’t came. I would like my money back and am now trying to get it by having to explain the situation to different people over and over.  Never ever would I have expected this shoddy of a product from a paper company. The one I got also was slow to ship. Beware. Especially if you need for a special occasion.",0
"Title: Sequenced beeping noise even when pedal is not in use
Review: Sound quality aside, I had to return it because it kept making a low volume, but still able to hear, beeping noise that sounded like a sequencer set to the pace of the delay time. Even turning the pedal off, if it's even in the chain it would make it. I tried it in different chain positions as well as the effects loop, and nothing helped the noise. It may have to do with that I play through a bass amp and that noise is too low to come through on a guitar amp, but unfortunately I don't own a working purely guitar amp currently so I couldn't cross test before returning. However, I now own other reverb and delay pedals and I've never heard a beeping from them even on the bass amp, so I'm not sure what's up with this one.<br /><br />As far as t",0
"Title: Pretty cute book/ could use a plastic protective wrap from the factory tho
Review: So this is a cute and well done book, I absolutely love it! I'm an adult and got this for myself so it's not just for kids!<br /><br />**It should be noted that there's some sort of manufacturing issue or something with these right now. The first one we got had a corner that was super chewed up on it. We exchanged it and the next one had a wrinkled up/ smashed spine and back. I think the manufacturer at the very least needs to put a plastic wrap around this book but maybe they need to package them in their own boxes too. Just a note to the company,",1
"Title: This Thing Is AWESOME!  I Use Indoors And Outdoors With Canon G12 Camera
Review: I have to take a lot of photos for products as well as artwork and subjects that I want to use for artwork.  Having a nice tripod which is adaptable for various situations is important.  This one fills a void I had for a flexible tripod.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />If you know camera stuff, this package won't faze you at all. If you are new to the whole world of photography, this set might seem to be a bit rough at first.  Hang in there.  Everything comes in a small thin box.  The instructions are sparse and not overly well written, but they do help.<br /><br />TRIPOD<br />The tripod has very flexible strong legs that can be bent into a number of positions.

"Title: Complete Knock Off and Waste of Time.... Skip It!
Review: For those seeking something while waiting for the next Harry Potter, BEWARE! This book is an obvious knock-off of the popular Rowling books and is so pooly written I found myself groaning during each chapter. A boy, who has lost a parent, goes to a special school because he is magically gifted where he becomes friends with another boy and girl. Sound familiar? I could have forgiven the transparency of this tale had the writing in any way made up for it. Poor description and even poorer conversational writing make this book a bore. Even its cover art is an attempt to cash in on Harry's popularity. Do yourself a favour and read The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper instead of this trash.",0
"Title: Very soft, has pee stripe and fits well
Review: Overall, this diaper is a great first diaper to use for your newborn.  I bought pampers because that's the only brand I had really heard prior to becoming a mother.  I was very satisfied with how soft they are and how the elastic legs don't seem to be too tight for babies.  As a first time parent, I also appreciate the wetness indicator.  I became obsessed with changing my baby if I even saw a hint of the stripe.  Now that he's 1 year old, I can relax a bit...<br /><br />These are the diapers I choose when I make diaper cakes for girlfriends' baby showers.  They have a very white, fluffy and soft look to them... and I know the diapers will get used since they're considered a ""premium.""<br /><br />While I really like these, I also highly rec",1
"Title: Not what I ordered

Guess I need to lie first. Now the bad..<br /><br />This item pictured was not what I got at all. Not even close. If I got the item described I might have loved it but it wasn't what I ordered. I got a flat bottom cheaper item.  I could have just ordered something else for cheaper if that's what I wanted. The one I got had a few gouges on the outside, was flat at the bottom, and was thin.  Perhaps they don't make it anymore, perhaps they were out of the described item, perhaps they thought I wouldn't care. I don't know.  I guess I am just picky, I like getting what I o",0
"Title: Thank You Miss Hickson!
Review: I have some of the very oldest dvd's of this series.  I felt if I waited awhile a nice new update would come out.  My point is that Joan Hickson was the best Miss Marple. I miss her so very much.  I ask British  native mystery fans if they have an opinion why she did not do more.  Their answer is always the same, that she was getting older.  If only we could have every book and short story Christie wrote on Miss Marple starring her. What a joy.  She truly added to my enjoyment of life and I am grateful. I hope her surviving family read this.  I am having trouble finding reruns on streaming of Netflix, Amazon, and Acorn with Miss Hickson.  Its easy and convenient vs. dvd's.  One feels everything will appear on streaming eventually but for ex",1
"Title: I can breathe again!1!
Review: My makeup was staining my facemask & it was difficult to breathe under my it, so I was looking for something that would protect my expensive mask.  Also, inhaling & exhaling air made my facemask expand & retract!!  Not happy, so I ordered the 3D face bracket & WOW what a great product! Mask is now clean, breathing is better, and I also found that if I put a few ""stitches"" to secure the mask in place, and to avoid potential loss of the bracket, it worked even better for me!!!  When taking off the mask, I was concerned I'd lose the bracket.  If I want to wash my facemask, I just snipped the stitches & stitched it up again.....not really a big deal & now it's perfect!!!",1

"Title: Excellent quality, super sturdy
Review: This is a well-made three sided easel that is super easy to assemble, and sturdy enough to last for many years. Perfect for the preschool or daycare setting, or even homeschool if you have several little ones. Top notch materials and workmanship, and very well-thought out. This will not tip and leaves plenty of space for three littles to paint, draw, etc. at the same time without stress. Probably a good size for preschool up to about 2nd grade. Easily comes apart with velcro to store flat. Easy-clean metal media trays.",1
"Title: Made my dog sick
Review: I tried these treats and cut them into tiny little 1/4ths for training. They smell very strong and worked for it. My pup was having GI issues at the time and being a pup we wondered if she had a parasite or something. I actually work in a vet clinic so in total had three stool samples two of which were sent to the same lab and the the third a different lab to make sure we were not missing something. Kind of started trying to rule other things out and when I ran out of these treats it improved, but when I got them again the GI issues returned. They were essentially causing a bacteria overgrowth of a bacteria naturally found present in their gut. She was not like deathly ill but how good can You feel running out whining frantically to get out",0
"Title: Good Hiding Spot
Review: My daughter has a leopard gecko. She's planning on taking him with her to the apartment she's going to live in at college in the fall. But she wants to bring him home over long breaks. Her plan is to have a tank set up at each location rather than transporting the large tanks back and forth. She'll get a travel container for the drives. She has set this up in her home tank for now to try it out. It's a good piece. The gecko has found a good hiding spot in it. We don't see him climbing around it, but he does have to climb it to get to the hiding spot. My daughter is pleased with the quality of it.",1
"Title: Broke within a couple months
Review: I bought this from my local grocery store for 12.99 and came here looking to see if anyone else had figured a way to fix it without replacing the whole thing and throwing the old one in the garbage. I try not to waste things and feel bad throwing something away after only a few uses. The plastic piece that attaches the mop head to the handle is cheap plastic and broke soon after purchasing this. Considering this is the part that swivels with every use, you'd think they'd make it durable enough to last a year at least, but I guess they prefer we buy the same thing over and over again and just throw it away.",0
"Title: 1 star because I no longer support giving this group any money or publicity
Review: The product itself is fine and the group is talented.  After my friend and I bought tickets to see them recently, a t-shirt there, and a prior signed vinyl of this album, the group hastily left behind a very small group of us waiting after the show for a simple in person autograph of this vinyl or perhaps a wave or hello.  This band does not care about its fans, which is a shame because they had been one of my favorites for a long time.  If you buy this product just be assured you are purchasing from a group that does not care about the fans at all.  If you are fine with that, it does sound good.",0
"Title: ORIGINAL RECORDINGS 1966-1969
Review: A fan of the ""Snoopy Songs"" cannot go wrong with this release.  I'm pleased to announce that the entire side of the album that featured The Stories of Snoopy and his nemesis (""Snoopy And His Friends The Royal Guardsmen"") as well as the songs ""Snoopy vs The Red Baron"", The Return Of The Red Baron"" and ""Snoopy's Christmas"" are exactly as originally released back in the 60's. The sound is clean and full (especially for 1960's bubblegum style music) and it seems as good as the original vinyl. The rest of the music is here, too. All the covers, originals and even more Snoopy. All the songs from all the albums. This is a fine re-release.  BTW....The album title is ""Original Recordings 1966-1969""",1

Review: It will be enjoyed by entire family.  He is hiding in woods due to having killed a man who mistreated woman he loved. Two young boys come across him living in boat which is in trees.  They keep him supplied with food and supplies, stealing motor to get boat ready so he can flee as law gets closer.  Gal he defended is in town and boys deliver notes to her so she can escape with him but not meant to be as she loves all the guys.  Boys are brave getting black eyes trying to protect her and one boy thinks he has a girlfriend but she publically ridicules him.  One boy's parents are splitting up.

Review: Tungsten Carbide (TC) burrs are something I use regularly for metal crafting. This is a very well made set of 10 identical SC-3 double cut coarse all Tungsten Carbide Burrs with 1/4 inch shanks for my high speed rotary tool use. My excellent cordless 20V DeWalt Die Grinder with these burrs really is super! These are nicely finished with a coarse double cut without any visible flaws. The burrs are all the same round nosed SC-3 Round Nosed Cylinder and each has its own tube holder and are shank labeled.

Review: The Caloics headlamp is probably one of the brightest lights I have used. Included in the kit are three chargers: an outlet charger, a car charger and a USB charger. The device comes with a white lens, but an additional yellow filter is provided that can be used in challenging conditions (i.e., fog, snow, nightfall).  The Caloics is super easy to adjust and is very comfortable when worn around the head. There are four different settings that adjust the lighting from standard to strobing. All of these settings can be controlled by the power switch, a rubber button, which can be easily found in the dark. These can be used for camping, working on vehicles, searching for bats in caves (ok, joking), hunting, fishing or searching for shells on th",1

Review: I love this little coffee filter. I bought it for backpacking and I just got back from 9 days on the Appalachian Trail.  I brought a little container of grounds and used this to make fresh hot coffee every morning. I ended up making a cup for other people I met in the shelters nearly every morning because it's just so much nicer than instant.  This takes up virtually no space and is really lightweight, so it's absolutely perfect for backpacking or camping. And it makes a good cup of coffee (I poured the hot water over it, and then let it sit for a few minutes for the best taste).  I 100% recommend this! (I was recommending it to everyone on the trail, in fact).",1

But alas, it ended basically how you would assume, with less gusto.  Anyway, the female lead is a rude, shallow, self centered, lemming; even by angsty high school standards.  After seeing how horrible of a person she's been, and how awful her friends are, the conclusion she comes to is...""well that's just the way she is, and I still love her.""  Umm, no B.

"Title: But they also double as helping the airflow a bit better than the last feet
Review: My gigabyte laptop lost a little tiny rubber foot, and then, of course, rocked back and forth while I typed. Tried to find the feet on ebay and through the company but came up empty-handed. These aren't as thick as I thought they would be, my main concern was making getting it in and out of the backpack sleeve harder. But they also double as helping the airflow a bit better than the last feet. So I only put 2 small feet on the back side of the laptop, and it's been great. Been even thinking about adding some to my other laptops just because they work so well and they aren't too bulky.",1

I narrowed it down to four that I was considering and showed them to my husband, he without hesitation said to get this one!  Well, I believe he was right!
