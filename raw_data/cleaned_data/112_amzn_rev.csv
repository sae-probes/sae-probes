"An absolutely massive plate of chicken, fried-up veggies, and rice greeted us after we ordered the jerk chicken - it's a good thing we presciently chose to share!  Even between two of us it didn't all completely disappear.\n\nThe texture of the chicken was half tender, half car tire.  Not sure how they managed that.  The spice level was light, but some spicy orange sauce (meant for the plantains, but the plantain-eater is a spice-o-phobe) helped.  The chicken oil that soaked the rice made it ten times more delicious.  And the veggies may look like sad old Chinese stir-fry rejects, but they taste better than they look.\n\nThere's a big cooler filled with Jamaican drinks, or approximations thereof (see: Reed's ginger brew) and everyone's friendly as can be.",184,2
"I hate going here!  I say that because I end up needing to buy things here.  Its always full of people and most of the time it is packed with snowbirds.  Not my crowd of folks to hang out with, but can make for a slower than usual shopping experience at this location.\n\nEverything is fresh, produce and deli items are usually in good condition.",80,3
"Went to Kaya with my roommate, since she said the food was good the last time she went with her friends.  We arrived about 7:15pm on a Friday night, and the place wasn't too crowded and the service was good.\n\nWe ordered some nigri sushi and some of the skewers (bacon wrapped scallops - decent; beef tongue - under-seasoned, disappointed).  Most of the fish are good, but some were not too fresh.  \n\nAlso tried the Sweety Roll (based on previous Yelp review) and was really disappointed at how this tempura-style roll turned out to be.  The roll is big, but also filled with mostly rice.  The eel sauce it was dressed with tasted burnt=bitter, which is mostly not how eel sauce is supposed to taste like here normally.\n\nAlso tried the Rock & Roll (which the waiter said was a cucumber wrapped roll without rice) served with a kiwi sauce.  When the roll arrived, I can clearly see that whoever prepared it was no experienced sushi master or even someone with a decent knife skill (cucumber slice was uneven and on the thick side). The roll is also wrapped in seaweed with lots of rice and the fish described in the menu, which is then wrapped in the thick cucumber sheet. The kiwi sauce was okay, most likely made by blending mayo + some kiwi + sugar, which I thought was interesting to try, but nothing to write home to rave about.\n\nService from the waitstaff also suffered once we have been there for about 30 minutes, since there were a few groups of 5 or 6 that arrived. It was difficult to place new orders, get refills on our beverages, until additional waitstaff stepped in to help out.\n\nOverall, I would say that it is a decent AYCE sushi experience for the $29 (incl tax and tip, no other beverages).  But if you go, stick to their nigiri and appetizer menu.  The special rolls sounds good on paper, but falls short on taste and execution. Also sit at the sushi bar if you can, so you can at least ask the sushi chefs what fish is fresh and what you should avoid.",459,1
"Went to eat here with my family which is a big group.  We decided to get separate checks to keep it easier for both the staff and us.   The food came out relatively quickly but we had no way of remembering who ordered what (as is common with big sushi orders).  My end of the table continually received tons of sushi to the point where we asked if it was a mistake.  The server kept saying that this was what we ordered even after suggesting several times that perhaps it was for the other end of our large party who hadn't received most of the sushi they had ordered.  Since there is a time limit and a per piece charge for uneaten sushi we cancelled the remaining order for our end of the table.  \nMeanwhile, the other end of the table had only received one of the rolls out of the 5-6 they had ordered.  When it was brought to the servers attention, she said that it was coming.....but still didn't put it together that our end of the table had gotten way more than we ordered.  \nSo, long story short, the owner came out and pretty much said \""too bad\"" and that they could order more since it was all you can eat...  We were already past the 90 minute limit and most of the party was done eating.  Reality is that they were just unaccommodating.  The sushi was fine and the price was right...but I felt bad that some of our party left hungry and they still paid the same amount as the rest of us who were full of sushi.",325,1
"Ok why does the gate have to be like a million miles away?  I swear that tram ride gets longer every time I go.  When you get there, it seems ok.  I guess the anticipating of getting to the strip has you distracted from the fact that it is a long way to get out of the airport.\n\nOn the way home, everything is miserable.  The long walk to security.  The horrible long lines, even when I flash my badge to go through the express lane.  The ride on the tram seems like you gone a mile to get to this 3-story escalator.  When you get to the top you are greeted by restaurants that makes your hangover worse from all the greasy smell in the air.  The only good experience I had was getting bored from a delayed flight and slipping a $5 bill into the slot machine and winning $87.00, 10-minutes later.",194,1
"Potomac Bakery is pretty darn wonderful - this is one of the places my family will often go to when we need a cake or cookies for special events. Everything is always fresh and the dough and icing or other toppings always taste really good, rather than too strong or too \""meh,\"" which is a common problem with other bakeries. \n\nI went in to pick up a snack today and found all of the display cases were full with Easter-themed treats; it was quite the colorful display, and it smelled delicious! I also love the fact that the bakery sells little milk bottles and tea cartons - you'll definitely need a drink to wash down any and all sweet treats you pick up here. \n\nOne major drawback: nowhere in the store did I see a sign mentioning that there's a $10 minimum if you want to use a debit or credit card. Not a big deal, unless you're like me and you don't typically carry cash. Fortunately, I had just enough quarters in my wallet to cover my small purchase here today. \n\nSo. If you're looking to place a big order or two? All the thumbs up for this place! But if you just want a snack...well, be ready to take a minute to stop by an ATM first, if your bank is nearby.",278,3

"I've always heard about Pink's while living in Colorado and I actually discovered it by watching the Travel Channel best eats show. The location in Atlanta is the prime location for Pink's but the one out here in Vegas is on point as well! I had my very first experience 5 days ago and ordered the Bacon Chili Cheese Dog and and Corona to wash it down. Needless to say I smashed it! LOL But it was so much food I didn't know where to begin and take my first bite. Whatever you do bite high and at an angle or it'll be all over the place. Then bite low at an angle on the 2nd bite, and repeat! My new favorite place to get a quick bite :-)",151,4

"This was my last stop during my Las Vegas trip because I really wanted to try their famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. That did not disappoint. I would give 3 and a half stars if I could, but the three will suffice.\n\nIt was a Friday afternoon, and the restaurant was not busy to my surprise. All we wanted was dessert, and we had decided to get the hot chocolate and some sundae with cake in it. The waitress did not come until about 10 minutes after we were seated, but that was understandable because she was waiting on about 5 or so tables. We ordered when the waitress finally came, and the waiting game began again. The sundae and frozen hot chocolate did not come for almost 20 minutes.  People who ordered AFTER us, who were ordering meals, got their food before we got ours.\n\nThe wait was really bad for the amount of people there that day. Maybe they're just understaffed, who knows? But to top it all off, I noticed that my fork (which I did not need to use, since I was getting dessert) was still clearly dirty. I probably will just order Frozen Hot Chocolate to go next time and won't be dining here again.",259,2
"When this place first opened, it was great and probably worthy of 5 stars.  The last few times we've been it was good enough to satisfy a breakfast craving, but nothing special.  Service is a bit slow at times and we've been having bad luck with the potatoes coming out half burnt.  You'd think that for a breakfast place, they would have a good selection of juices, but you only get the choice of apple or orange (at least the times we've been there it was that way).  Overall, it's decent and fills a void in the area.  If you want breakfast or home cooking in the Queen Creek area, this is probably the best choice but don't expect anything spectacular.",153,2
"This place is great. For 2 years I attended & took all the coursework & tests for my friend so his mom would keep sending me money.

"This is the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at. We've been here 2 nights and had to change rooms 2 times. The problem with the first room was that the door was to difficult to open. The second room wasn't much better, the battery in the smoke detector needed to be replaced because it beeped all night, the bath tub water only got luke warm, the electrical outlets are not at all secure, and not every lamp had a light bulb. Also, the second room didn't have a fridge & microwave and we paid for one. I'm in the third room now. OMG, the toilet keeps backing up so we had to get a plunger. This entire room is unsanitary. We can either plug in the fridge, microwave, or TV, but not all three. At least there's hot water. They are a little lax on the housekeeping as well. I'm not in the habit or writing negative reviews, but our experience here has been nightmarish.",209,0
"We decided to bring the Bears crew back to Versus this year, what a mistake that was, service is ok and prices are very very expensive compared to other sports bars for football, We had 3 large pitchers of beer (Bud Light) and one large cheese pizza and it came to $56.00 dollars? The service this night was horrid, the owner of my company was with us and his wife and the waitress forgot his beer 3 times and his wife's soda 2 times and when it was time for the check 4 times she had to be reminded,.\n\nNow I don't get mad very easy, but when you come to me after I pay you and give you a 15% tip and you tell me \""did I do something wrong for the tip I got\"" around my friends and family and embarrass me like that and we give you another $10 bucks and you shrug your shoulders and say \""I guess that's ok\"" do you think we are going to come back?

"Albeit we ate here during River Jam on a Thursday, but our table had all kinds of problems primarily with the food.  The pulled pork sandwich didn't come with everything the menu described, the burger was dry, and the chicken nachos were fine but difficult to mess up.  \n\nThis is really the only place for a 'sit-down dining' experience at the Whitewater Center, but most of us don't come for that so don't expect much if you have to eat there.  I feel bad for the server as it wasn't his fault, and he did keep apologizing.  For them, it was easier to keep bringing us our beers and hope we forget about the food quality.",150,1
"My friend suggested that we start our Saturday night here before heading out to other Halloween festivities. Besides feeling completely out of place in our Halloween costumes we had a great time;-) It's a pretty low key place and it sits towards the back of this shopping complex so unless you know where you're going you would never find it. \n\nWe had a great experience since my friend personally knows one of the owners. We sat on the patio and started off with drinks and hookah and we were given some great suggestions for food. I decided to go for the chili prawns and garlic naan and a side of the basmati and saffron rice. I'm still drooling thinking about this food, it was so fresh and flavorful, I couldn't stop eating!!! The sauce the prawns came in...MAN was it tasty! \n\nAfter hookah, drinks and this delish food my girls and I got up danced a bit with the resident belly dancer inside of the restaurant! Overall it was a great experience, we felt like we were part of the family! Great service, great ambiance and perfect for dates or family night. \n\nIf I lived closer I would definitely be a regular!",246,3
"Completely overpriced for this time of year.  With temps barely crossing 50 for only a few hours each day, I'm not sure how they justify $60 per round.  I'm new to Vegas so I don't know how the courses change and adapt with the seasons, but I wouldn't say this course was in good shape at all.   If you compared the course today to what the pictures or video show online, they are totally misleading.  Again, maybe this is a seasonal thing where the rough all dries up and turns yellow, but the all/most of the greats seemed to be a brownish color with patches of bright green which might have been a fungus or something because it looked like a lot of tiny 3-4 leaf clovers packed together....but what do I know, I don't have a turf management degree.\n\nMost of the course plays down hill and is set up to offer favorable bounces helping you get from the rough to the fairway off the tee.  However, the bunkers are awful..mostly filled with rocks.  In many spots it wasn't just a few pebbles, they were rocks...stuff that will scratch/knick/ding up your clubs unless you give yourself relief.  The best thing about the course were the views.  You can see almost the entire valley and beautiful Vegas scenery...but that still doesn't justify the rates.  I could probably stomach a $30-$35 round here this time of year, but not $60...especially when you can head north to Paiute and play a course in mint condition for $40.  I likely won't be back unless I catch wind of a twilight rate that actually begins at a time when you can finish 18.",367,1

"Ok, but they do not go out of their way to help! I didn't have a credit card so at first they said I couldn't check in. Finally they allowed me to put down cash. Then I went to breakfast, and the shuttle refused to pick us up because \""roads were too bad\"" We waited for 45 minutes at the restaurant. No cabs could pick us up, so I called the hotel and explained our situation (had to get to work soon, 5 mth pregnant woman with me, only a mile and a half away). He said he couldn't help. We had to walk while the snow blew in our faces. When we were almost there, we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it, driving in the opposite direction, away from us. I cannot believe how rude they were",174,1
"I really enjoyed this place when it was a smaller coffee shop.  Now it has grown too crowded and the lines are too long.

"All the trappings of a Williamsburg, NY inspired craft food experience. \n\nCraft cocktails, hipster chic ambience, wall paper, etc. \n\nThe food was quite good, the drinks were not bad. \n\nFor Madison, this place is a chart topper.\n\n\n\n\n--\n\nThat said, I am about to pick on this place because it could be awesome, but makes a few errors that could easily be corrected.\n\n1) The signage for the restaurant is  art nouveau which is incongruous for a place with a New American cuisine and interior, and it misleads some of the graphics inside the restaurant.\n\n2) The Christmas lights in the windows gotta go. There are better ways to bring much needed attention to the windows without cheapening the rest of the investment in design.\n\n3) The water bottles that sit on the table need to be changed out to something with a real vintage feel, it makes a big difference in the experience as they sit on the table for the entire meal.\n\n4) The drink menu is a bit over designed, hard to use, and doesn't really tell me if I can buy the booze on the wall, which is a big miss for cross promotion if I can.\n\n5) The staff tried, and are clearly trained, but need to keep training and being inspired to want to create the right experience.\n\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed my steak and would stop back by to try the brunch next time I am in town.",330,3

"I've been here twice for breakfast. The portions are nice but the prices are a little high. The first time I went I had the eggs benedict, which would have been wonderful if it weren't for the mysterious piece of gristle in my ham. They serve the eggs on a very thick slice of ham, which had a really smooth smoky flavor.The home fries are delicious! The second time I went was on a Saturday morning, which meant waiting for 45 minutes for a table. That time I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was very satisfying. It was a large piece of steak and had the nice crispy crust that I like. The gravy was rich and smooth, not chalky like some tend to be. My Mother-in-law ordered the french toast and loved it. \n\nI really like this place, it's just too long of a wait and a little overpriced.",190,2
"No no no... The service was terrible. We walked in at 9:00pm on a Saturday night after having dinner across the street. I had to check the hours on the door to make sure they were open as the employee was too busy with closing duties to greet us. She didn't even acknowledge us. That was a bit off-putting but I still wanted fro-yo. I looked around for some tasting cups but didn't find any. I asked the employee, that was busy putting paper towels down on the drip trays on all the fro-yo machines, for them. She grudgingly walked behind the counter to get us some. Ok... fine... She made it really clear that we were not welcome there. I still took my sample cups and started to pull the levers to try some flavors. To my surprise, the frozen yogurt was far from frozen. They were just a big  melted mess, spurting a partially frozen, sticky slurry on my hands. That might have explained all the flashing red lights on the machines. I asked the employee why they were like that. She answered, with no shortage of attitude, that it was really slow and that was why they were like that. She offered no solution. That was the last straw. I left without making a purchase. I had no desire to spend my money at a place where I didn't feel welcome. I really don't need employees rolling their eyes at me. There are lots of other fro-yo spots that are much more pleasant! Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location.",327,0

"I think \""promising\"" is perhaps the best word for Turquoise Thistle. Situated in the Hotel Indigo, on York Place, it's a smart restaurant space, with a nice adjoining bar area. Lunch is reasonably priced at \u00a312.95 for two courses; \u00a314.95 for three. It lacks something, though, and a number of the dishes have room for improvement. However, the beef shin, currently on their menu, is very good, so it's worth a visit simply to sample that dish.\n\nSo overall, we said: \""Turquoise Thistle was pretty decent. I get the impression that there's a really good restaurant waiting to happen here, but things just need to be approached with a little more confidence. Dishes were well thought out, but lacked a little in the execution. The place is likely to suffer from lack of lunchtime footfall, while the tram works are going on in York Place, but will serve its hotel patrons rather nicely. I can imagine that I'll be back in the future. I hope to see them building on the success of their friendly service and stylish premises, as well as that excellent beef dish, which was a real winner.\""",258,2

"Normally going to Vegas I would never rent a car but I did need to go outside the strip and found a great deal for a compact car through hotwire.  From the airport there is a shuttle that takes you to the car rental place which is all in one location.  The Hertz counter is up the escalator on the right.  I did have to wait a while for a rep.  She did do the normal questioning about upgrading to a convertible, then a bigger car, then one with power seating, and then finally how i was planning to fill up gas and insurance. Not having power seating was a bummer but not the end of the world and the car came with a GPS so that definitely is a plus.  However, that GPS definitely took a very very long time to find a satellite. Supposedly Nevada has a law that does not allow car insurance companies to deal with the car rental places but I still opted out since I wasn't going to be there long and NV drivers are definitely much more tame than drivers in the DC area.",215,2

"Five of us went out for dinner.  We tried the fried yucca with cheese and sirloin (Yuca Cuzco Dos Sabores/Yucca Two Flavors), unfortunately the sirloin was missed on the dish, otherwise it was an interesting appetizer.

I would have been happy if it was only served over the rice that was on the side.\nArroz con Mariscos/Peruvian Paella  - Came with full shell fish.\n\nUnfortunately the food came out one at a time, so we had to sit and stare at each other while we waited for the rest of the food to come out.  We did not get the chance to try the sangria, since they had run out.  \n\nSince the restaurant just opened, I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt and try again in a few months.

"I won't even rate the park. I have been to many water parks. \""Bigger and better\"" they said. Not even. The one on the strip was much better. The park is NOT worth your money at all.

The park had maybe three slides that were decent, but the lines were way too long. They need to get rid of the Express Pass (The larger water parks don't even have those). The express pass seems to be delaying the lines even more. Maybe the lines seem longer because Las Vegas doesn't have much to do for a family who lives there. No beach, and this is the ONLY water park. It had the feel of a large regular park with some slides. The food was also disgusting and I felt that they had no right to charge the regular $8, 10, 15 bucks for lockers. This isn't a proper water park and should not be charging prices of that of one.",247,0
"I have never considered myself a feminist of the Gloria Steinem or even Debbie Stoller vein, but this place makes me want to be one. \n\nGreat selection of books. There's something of everything: fiction, poetry, non-fiction, scifi/fantasy, mystery, children's, graphic, LGBT, ethnic studies, history, crafts, psychology and self-help, cooking. The only thing missing, I suppose, are Computer Software and GRE/GMAT/SAT type books. The fiction section is amazing--lots of new and interesting titles, and somehow, they've made every book they've stocked look interesting and attractive (aesthetically) that you want to buy it.\n\nCome here for a real bookstore with real people who know books. It will make you want to read again. You don't need to be a feminist and you don't need to be a woman to spend a good hour or two in this store.",201,4
"Just got home from an evening with close friends at Nobuo's...been wanting to go for awhile now because I am a big fan of asian fusion cooking..especially Japanese fusion.  Really, really good food and presented beautifully!  \n\nSince there were four of us we shared the tasting menu (X2) and some items off of the menu...tasting menu featured a Japanese Antipasti (pickled daikon, snap peas in miso and house made kimchi), Asian spoons with kumamoto's and Uni and house cured salmon, himachi with avacado, grapefruit and truffle oil, braised oxtails and a dessert plate.  All the flavors were fresh, blended well and left your palate excited and refreshed. Artfully presented on really cool china.... Highly recommend the tasting menu!!\n\nWe also ordered the 25min poached egg with asparagus (awsomely silky texture, cooked sous vide style), octopus fritters, pork belly buns, and the teeter tots...all was great!\n\nLovely food in a lovely atmosphere!  The service was very good also!  (thanks Greg!)",234,4

"I will never go to this post net ever again. The male that offered to help me was a big snoot. All I needed was to make color copies and he proceded to deny service to me making it a point that my paper work was going to break down his 30,000 dollar copy machine which was absurd. He had a disgusting attitude. He Practically threw back my paper work and told me to go to office max . What a way to protect his buissiness and to help a customer.an example of a great way to put your attitude before the success of your buissiness. A big thumbs down to this location!!!!!!

"My wife and I had a craving for Middle Eastern food. I checked on Yelp and found this place where our friends could meet us halfway. They bailed, but we went ahead and enjoyed a delicious meal. \nIt was a bit strange to be eating in an old 5 and Diner restaurant. None of the ambiance was changed except for the addition of the TV and water pipes lining the wall. We were there for the food.\nWe started off with the Baba Ghannoughe. The pit bread was okay and the Baba Ghannoughe was oily but edible. \nMy wife ordered a cup of Lintel soup with her Chicken Sharawma sandwich. The soup was excellent and she ordered a bowl to go which looked like a cup instead of a bowl. \nHer sandwich was okay...we got spoiled at Sabuddy when it was in Tempe and and then in Scottsdale, their sandwich was in the pocket of the pita bread and not wrapped like a burrito.\nI ordered the Shish Kafta which was 3 pieces of ground beef and lamb char-broiled with a side of onions & tomato and white rice topped with currant raisins. The meat was cooked just right...firm & flavorful and the rice was okay. It's a good thing I didn't eat lunch 'cause there were good portions on my plate.\nWe topped it off with Baklava...mmmm...so good.",289,3
"This motel was one of my only options as it was right off of the highway and allowed dogs. This was the week of the monster Nov storm that hit the east coast and I was exhausted from driving slow in the rain.  It was late and not being a NC native, I had no idea that I wasn't in the most favorable part of town.  Check in was smooth, though the front desk guys were not very friendly, but just doing their job.  \n\nOddly, the room was nicer than I was expecting and the bed was decent too.  I wasn't expecting this as I was jaded by my earlier experience at a filthy Quality Inn in TN.  After seeing some of the interesting people hanging around the neighboring rooms and driving in and out, I decided to empty my car completely.  I know, I sound like a snob don't I....well I checked out the crime blotter for the area on my phone and read that there had been a robbery in the neighboring parking lot which resulted in a shooting, a few days earlier.  So I made sure the door was locked.  Luckily it was pouring, and I think this disabled some of the regular activity that happens at this motel at night.  The TV kept timing out every hour, but other than that the room was decent for a motel.\n\nIn the morning as I was leaving, I was trying to pack up my car while holding my dog's leash.  I put him in the front seat with the door cracked, and proceeded to try and shove my guitar back in my trunk.  I was having some issues fitting it back in despite it fitting fine the day before.  In my frustration, I didn't notice the 2 meth-head looking guys walking towards me, babbling fastly about what kind of guitar I had, did I need help, \""Let me see it\"", and about ready to grab it, as my new rescued swamp dog knocked the front door open with his nose and barked like a crazy dog at them.  They walked off pretty fast as their toothless hobo friends looked down from the balcony.  If it had not been for my dog, I would have knocked the guy in the mouth with the guitar case. \n\nI had also read that a few days earlier, up the street, a pregnant teenager was shot while sitting at a bus stop and died while her baby struggled for life in an incubator.  I didn't realize that Charlotte was such a shit hole, and I'll never go back. No wonder their basketball team moved to New Orleans......\n\nIf you ever get off at the Sugar Creek Exit, it better be just to go through the \""Cook Out\"" drive through, and nothing more.",572,1
"Service was very good; food not so much. My 6 oz Parmesan Encrusted steak was grey in the middle and the cheese was not put on until just before it was served, so it wasn't the same temp and didn't seem to be part of the steak. Broccoli was good, potatoes average. Steak was disappointing and tough, hard to cut. I like their burgers but wanted to try something different...wish I hadn't. \n\nOur server was very good; the skillet chocolate chip cookie was also VERY good. Next time a burger.",118,1
"This place, I don't know, maybe I am prejudiced after going to Italy this summer but the food (specifically the lasagna) is just so plain and, well, bad.",38,1

"It's pretty close to 3.75 stars.  \n\nThey offer a few dishes most AYCE sushi joints don't like ribeye Big Wong style, fresh oysters,  and kushiyaki (meat on a stick) options like bacon wrapped scallops.  It's actually a good place to bring that one friend who dislikes sushi.  I also like the all you can drink beer/wine/sake option for $10 more but they said they're going to change it next month.  Ummm....why??  \n\nThis location used to be Kaizen and you can definitely tell from the look of the place.  Interesting mix of old and modern and the long tables definitely encourage groups to stay a while.  We sat at the bar to pick the chefs brain on recommendations.  The whole staff was Korean.  Not too much of a big deal for me.  \n\nSushi standouts were the halibut and super white tuna nigiri.  The chef, Alex, said it was the freshest fish they had and it was great.  There were a ton of great options if you like cream cheese, rolls deep fried or something in unagi sauce.  I am not one of those people but knock yourself out a la Drago vs Creed if you are.  Basic rolls were fine and the freshness was acceptable.    \n\nI was really intrigued that they offered both miso and tonkotsu ramen.  I just HAD to try half a bowl of tonkotsu made by Koreans.  The noodles, broth and 2 big pieces of pork belly were pretty good but it wasn't exactly Japanese ramen.  Koramen?  Alex took pride in the fact he made the broth from scratch as he should..it was tasty but not Japanese by any means.  \n\nService was definitely on top of things.  There were 3 waiters checking on us throughout the meal and earned their gratuity.",409,2
"This place has the best Italian food I have had in the Las Vegas area so far. Over the past six years I have eaten at so many Italian restaurants out here and somehow this little cafe evaded me. On a chance encounter (I was going to try another joint called \""Bratalian\"" a block away but they had closed for dinner) I found this place thanks to Yelp and boy was I impressed. \n\nTo start I ordered a Calamari appetizer which was second to none as I order Calamari everywhere that has it. I then had a slice of cheese pizza which was superb, and the salad was very fresh with some black olives, a slice of artichoke heart, and a pepper. I also tried the Penne e Broccoli Chicken, a noodle, chicken, and broccoli dish as the name implies. \n\nI paid maybe twenty-five dollars and took home most of the entree as I was completely stuffed. For the prices this is the best Italian food you can find in Vegas in my honest opinion. Two can dine here for under thirty dollars tip included and still take some food home. \n\nKeep this place at 5 stars please as it deserves it!",244,4
"We went in to try something new. Heard great things and were excited for a night together. We asked the lady at the door for a table in the back, something dim and romantic ... And she sat us in front of the plate glass window up front. I repeated my request and she walked away.\n\nIt looks like a fun place for regulars, but we just sat there feeling left out of the party. Hospitality was really lacking, server did his best, but seemed overwhelmed with three tables. Someone who I assumed was Fran came by (didn't introduce herself) and asked how things were. We mentioned that things were a little slow and we had a problem with one of the apps ... She just smiled and nodded and walked off. I don't think she heard a word I said. Kind of distracted. We got a glass of wine, and wanted a second, but it never arrived. We were charged for it anyway. Would have complained, but by the time the check came, we just couldn't wait to leave.\n\nWe tried several different apps, none of which arrived hot. The bacon tots were flavorless ... A real shame, because the premise was so promising. We shared the crab cakes for entree, very small, soggy and buried under carrot shavings.\n\nThe TV over the bar was tuned to the food network. What was playing there looked much more appetizing than anything that came to our table.\n\nPerhaps things are different for lunch, or for the regulars. I'm sad to report we won't find out.",324,0
"Being Indian and having eaten at many of the best Indian restaurants in the valley, I'm not your usual casual diner who knows nothing about Indian food. I usually eat dosa and South Indian fare at Woodlands (Ray and Rural). I tried Cafe Krishna for a change. I was disappointed. The service was lousy. The waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long. We ordered an appetizer and two dosas. They took a 30 minutes to bring us our appetizer and another 30 minutes (1 hour) before we got our dosa. It was not busy when we ordered. There were only 3 couples in the restaurant at the time and they had 3 waiters. They never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill. One of the waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. She brought our chaat to our table and didn't even bring plates with it.\n\nThe food itself was good but not noteworthy. Their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands is a lot better. The dosa had very little sabji (potato) filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands includes much more sabji. I did like the sabji and thought it was better than Woodlands because it was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. It had very little samosa (maybe two small pieces of one samosa)  and the rest of it included vegetables. It wasn't bad but neither was it tasty.\n\nThe only positive aspect to the place was it's ambience. Despite its \""cafe\"" name, the place is a sit-down restaurant. It's nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. It was clean, spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated, given a menu and a waiter takes your order. It's not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. It has a full menu but it's vegetarian. It's also a South Indian place so I wouldn't recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians don't know how to cook North Indian food. \n\nI will not come back because the service was too slow. Even when we flagged our waiter for our bill, there was another couple who had sat for 15 minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken. Honestly, why would I wait an hour to eat Dosa when I can go up the street and eat at Woodlands and get the same quality dosa in 10 minutes. I'm pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. They didn't know how to refill drinks, check up on you, bring your bill to you on time. It seemed like they were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. If the restaurant improved their speed and service, I would recommend this place. Hopefully that will improve",653,1
"So I heard that this place is supposed to prepare you for an actual 'zombie apocalypse'. Well then, folks ain't kiddin--this shop has everything you need to get ready for an apocalypse. They're all practical, too. This joint has everything from weapons to even food rations such as MREs.\n\nIt's pretty cool how a lot of this is actually useful and practical; however, they're a bit pricey. You can buy MREs for a cheaper price either on base over at Nellis AFB (that is, if you have a military ID and get get into the base) or at a military surplus store.\n\nRegardless, it's still worth checking this store out just for the interactive goodies alone. There's an area on the right side of the shop where you can shoot zombies at the mini-shooting gallery, and this other interactive thing where you can burn a zombie or so.\n\nAside from that, the shop also has the typical fair of zombie 'souvenirs' such as T-shirts, mugs, books, etc. for those who want to get their cheesy zombie fix. There's even books on how to make Twinkies. Speaking of which, one of the walls at the back has an actual Twinkie on display. There must be something good about Twinkies to make them useful for a zombie survival, LOL.\n\nThe shop is pretty cool overall, and it's great how the shop owners took the theme to a whole new level by adding all that interactive stuff. You can even do a fancy photograph, which they have at the back. Although I didn't really bother to check it out since it seemed like you had to pay for it.\n\nWhen Halloween comes around once again, be sure to check out this shop for when special events such as the Las Vegas Zombie Walk or Zombie Run happen. This store will supply everything you need to get ready for those events.",409,3
"Burgers were def on point! Had the Miyagi-san & it was delicious! Service sucked though, unfortunately. The bus boy was hella cool but the waiter was AWOL most the night. The Thai was bomb!

"Can't even believe I am giving it 1 star. Service was horrible at best. We received our food and it was cold. You could tell that the food was frozen and made hours prior and just thrown on a plate when ordered. While we were there 6 different waiters/waitresses walked by and nobody offered to refill our drinks. When our waiter finally came by to pick up our plates and I told him that my food was cold. He offered to remake my meal however everybody else was done and we were ready to leave. He then hands us our bill and charges us for the meal. While we were sitting there we could see the food prep area and we watched someone put a burger in the microwave prior to serving. Clearly my meal did not make it to the microwave step!\n\nWhen leaving we asked to speak with the manager. She came by and was very rude and argumentative. According to her chef the food was never cold. She also stated that she personally waited our table and ordered us extra drinks, which was a lie. Her next excuse for the horrible service was that she was dealing with one of the hotel towers being out of power. I finally got her to comp our meal and she said I would have the refund in a few days. She also refused to provide me a receipt. End up going to hotel management for this and other issues(different review) and got 1 night of our stay comp. \n\nWould not recommend to anybody!",303,0
"I almost don't want to write this for fear of the secret getting out, but here goes. Forget a table. Sit at the bar and enjoy your dinner alongside the fantastic bartenders. Even better, let them choose your dinner for you. You will likely end up with items that aren't even on the menu, like the to-die-for beef cheek ravioli.\n\nMy husband and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary here last month. It was our second visit to the restaurant in two years. That's how great the food and service are...despite the number of fine dining establishments in Vegas that we have yet to visit, we returned to this gem. We had reservations and enjoyed cocktails at the bar while waiting for our table. Cooper and his team behind the bar kept us entertained and made us feel right at home, so when we learned we'd be seated late, we opted to stay right where we were. It was an excellent decision. No need to go into major detail...quite simply, we put our trust in Cooper and he did not disappoint. \n\nCarnevino is now on our list of must-visit establishments every time we return to town.",245,4
"I know I am late to the noca party...I am so glad I finally got to go! We had a terrific experience here on Christmas Eve. We wanted someplace special (Read, expensive!) and I have heard so many great things about this place, it seemed the right time to splurge. \n\nWe had 6pm reservations. When we arrived, the restaurant was about 50% full. It got packed as we ate, though, so the 7pm reservations must be hard to come by. \n\nThe service was fantastic. We had a very attentive yet unobtrusive waitress. The best part of the service was when I looked over at the table next to me, who had been seated after us, and I noticed their food coming out when we had yet to see anything but the fun little amuse bouche. The snarkiness was barely forming in my mind when our server leaned in and said, \""I am so sorry for the wait. The kitchen misplaced your ticket. Dinner is on the house tonight. Merry Christmas!\"" I hadn't even had time to complain yet and she had already noticed the problem, inquired about it, and fixed it. I was very impressed (and thrilled to eat at noca for FREE!!!). \n\nOn to the food: \nApps:\n\n The clam chowder ($10) was fantabulous. It was rich, creamy, and laced with wine or sherry, and the clams were so tender and sweet; not like the typical rubbery bites you find in most chowders. \n\nThe polenta ($14) with bolognese was out of this world. The polenta was crisp on the outside and luxuriously creamy on the inside with flecks of fresh rosemary. The bolognese was rich and decadent, just like it should be. \n\nEntrees:\n\nI had the spinach linguine ($22) with assorted seafood. I was hooked by the boast of fresh pasta...usually I skip the pasta section when I go out to eat because I can make it just as well at home, but I am a sucker for fresh and this was no disappointment! It was a generous portion (not huge, but adequate) with large pieces of halibut, scallop, and probably some other white fish. The sauce was a delicate garlic cream sauce that barely coated the noodles; it was a nice change from the typical heavy, soupy cream sauces you typically get. \n\nHusband had the pork osso bucco ($19 maybe?) , which he said was excellent. It looked beautiful; I didn't try any. \n\nOf course we devoured the cotton candy; that was actually the main reason I had wanted to try noca. I loooove cotton candy, and it is such a fun touch. \n\nWe ordered dessert ($9), which was possibly the best part of the whole meal. It was a tart, heavenly passionfruit cream smothering an almond dacquoise, sprinkled with sheets of mereingue and topped with a scoop of coconut sorbet. I was actually pretty close to licking the bowl, manners be damned. \n\nThere have been complaints about portion size...know before you go, this is no Applebees. You are not going there to stuff your face with greasy fried. You are going there for a sophisticated culinary experience, part of which is the beauty of the presentation.\n\nI had expected to plunk down at least $100 for this meal. While I was super excited to have them comp it, I would have gladly paid for it. And it wasn't terribly expensive, because we didn't order drinks.  I think that's where noca gets the pricey reputation, because you can easily spend more on alcohol than on the entire meal. \n\nWe can't wait to go back! Thanks, noca, for making our Christmas Eve dinner an outstanding experience.",818,4

The cashiers aren't all that great either. I highly recommend you go somewhere else if you can.",151,1
"These are my favorite outlets! I almost always come here for a few hours every time I'm in Vegas. These stores always have good deals, but you might have to spend some time looking for them. A lot of the stuff is marked up a ton, then marked down to make it look like a deal - but there are good deals especially at BCBG, Spyder, and Banana Republic if you look. Make sure you sign up for coupons before going, occasionally they have decent ones:\nhttps://www.premiumoutlets.com/vip/index.asp\n\nThere are only 2 ways to get here if you don't have a car. By bus or cab. Spend the extra money and take a cab. It will cost about $18 one way with tip from the hotels in the center of the strip, and takes about 10 minutes to get there. If you take the bus you have to take the Deuce on the strip (which takes FOREVER in rush hour), then hop on another bus near the Stratosphere. The way back in the afternoon could easily take 1-2 hours and it would probably be quicker to just walk. \n\nThe outlets on the strip south of the airport are scary.

"I wasn't expecting much from Seven Saints, yet somehow I still left disappointed.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be a beer menu, perhaps because they're really proud of their Jameson and Red Bull cocktails (ick) and would rather advertise those on your table.  This would be okay if they hadn't hidden the drafts behind columns such that it's impossible to discover what types of beer they have.\n\nThe food menu was more promising.  It's split into two parts:  half the items were ripped off from Crane Alley (beet chips with goat cheese, sweet potato fries, cajun crab cake) and the other half are \""sliders\"".

I guess I'll go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight before my next visit! \n\nThe bruschetta we ordered was great, the same quality as the Campbell location.  Warm, thickly sliced artisan bread, covered with generous amounts of toppings.  Our favorites were the prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone cheese and the Apple & Brie.. yummy!!!  The food was the only reason I gave this night a 2 star.  \n\nAlthough we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed  our food... we stayed.  Big mistake!  We foolishly thought  once Jake Ryan and Caroline Mulford left the bar , the voodoo spell would be broken, that was not the case...the wait for the following drinks were just as lengthy as the first!\n\nIf I were the owner, .. I'd replace the Bar Staff with the Valet Staff.. The Valet Staff was quicker, service focused  and had more personality then anyone at the bar..\n\nI look forward to returning back to Postino Central when they have \""ironed out\"" the \""kinks\""..",580,1

"The Mitre is close to Waverly Station on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. A tourist friendly pub, The Mitre serves food until 10pm, offering a range of traditional Scottish dishes. I ordered the fish and chips which at \u00a37 were well worth the price. Admittedly, it's worth mentioning that I was very hungry, so it's possible it was more a matter of the quantity than the quality which sealed my approval.  \nMusicians perform a few days a week, playing a pretty wide range of folk music and contemporary covers. If you get there later on you can settle into a good spot before it gets too busy to soak up the atmosphere.   \nIf you're looking for a pub when you're waiting for a train, or just waiting, then try and snag a table outside on a sunny day and watch as life on the Royal Mile plays itself out.",192,2
"Ive been here a few times, food is pretty good. I wanted to get a delivery today but the guy on the phone was obviously in his own world. I ask for fried rice and orange chicken to which he replied soup. I said no I want orange chicken with friend rice. He replied the lunch special, I said im not sure what your special is all I want is friend rice. He said what fried rice, the rice that comes with the chicken. I hung up. Seriously? Just take the fucking order moron. Is it that hard to understand FRIED RICE AND ORANGE CHICKEN!",119,1
"Upon my recent stay, I was disappointed that the night manager upon check-in did not honor my marquis suite upgrade for a discounted rate when booked months prior to my stay. He charged me the full amount for a room upgrade and reasoning was because the hotel had less then 10 rooms available the day of check-in despite all the marquis suite's being unbooked. When I spoke to the day manager the next day, he pretty much hinted that the hotel didn't want to honor their room upgrade and wanted more money. Why offer a discounted upgrade in the first place. This honestly was my favorite hotel in Vegas. This is no longer the case.",135,1
"Had a beer and an appetizer, so-so.  Service was nice and quick, which is about all I need with the kids.

I ordered what should have been one of the best steaks on menu, 20oz bone-in Ribeye. It was really disappointing.

"I live in Gilbert Arizona and went to the Apple store at the San Tan mall here. I had to go in 3 different times before my phone was fixed, I was helped by 3 different people and ALL 3 times I was treated horribly!!! The first time my appointment was at 1:40 and they did not get to me till 2:15. The second time the guy helping was very condescending and made me feel stupid for not knowing much about the icloud (which I had never used) and would say things like \""well if you were at home and I wasn't here what would you do?\"" when I had a question and then he said he would be right back, walked away and I never saw him again, and the third time I was accused of LYING about my phone being broken (the exact words being \""well I could not duplicate the problem but for good faith we will replace the phone but if it happens again then we will KNOW it wasn't the phone.\"") after the guy takes my phone in the back room for a good 25 minutes leaving me sitting there having no idea what's going on. I left the store and cried I really could not even believe how awful I was treated. My whole family is furious with how horrible this experience has been that although the apple product is great the costumer service is SO BAD that we NEVER want to get an apple product again in fear of having to go in and talk with these people. Several of my friends have been trying to decide what kind of phone to get and after hearing my experience with this apple stores costumer service have gone with a different brand so to avoid the humiliation and frustration I went through! I honestly expected amazing service because apple professes to be costumer oriented. I can not even express enough my disappointment.",374,0
I have not been to this place in over 5 years until last night . It's a place that I think is easy to forget is there . You really need to know the area to find it . Known for it's huge beer selection . No dissapointment . 5 stars .The food is typical bar food with a few better enterees. 3 stars . The service  we had on the deck was top notch . The bar inside seems small but cozy . Great place to take a date and sit on deck and chat .,110,3

"Delicious!!!  Everything we had was absolutely amazing ... best New York steak I've ever had - very juicy and flavorful.  We also ordered 3 sides - sauteed broccoli, garlic mash and mac and cheese, all of which were also excellent!  Our server suggested adding a jalapeno into the mac and cheese to give it some kick, but some people in our group don't eat spicy food, so we didn't.  But I imagine that would have made it even better.  \n\nService was outstanding and I also love the ambiance.  We went on a Saturday night and they had live music in the bar area.  I'd definitely save this for a special occasion though as it was quite pricey.",152,4

"I found this boarding facility and was very interested based off the pictures.. but then I read the reviews, one specifically, about receiving a rude and harsh email. At first I thought the lady was probably overreacting, but following the review is a nasty post from the owner, I assume, defending her nasty email and speaking poorly of pitbulls. I am a proud pitbull owner and have been in the pet care industry for 6 years. Her narrow minded opinion on the breed is the reason they get a bad wrap. I would never entrust my pets with someone who fails to do research on breeds and bases opinions solely on stigma.

"Oh H&M at Scottsdale Quarter, how I have a love/hate relationship with you. Your employees aren't the friendliest and can, at times, boggle my mind and make wonder if they will be able to graduate high school or wonder if they did. I also must complain about how you never have more than one person ringing up customers, despite the length of the line. On a positive note, I like how cheap your clothes are priced, but again to a negative one, I do not like how cheaply made they can be resulting in one-maybe two-wears out of the clothing item before the hem unravels or a snag occurs from normal wear.

"Cannot even begin to describe the debauchery.. suffice to say, this was money well spent in a town where your dollar can be snatched happily for far less. The value was incredible.. in fact..I should just keep this info in my back pocket.. but I had so much fun, I just feel the need to share.\n\nThe fleet was large enough for the crowd of around 80+ that had gathered at the first meeting spot- PBR Rock Bar at Planet Hollywood.. we were greeted happily by our \""tour\"" guides and had not a one problem checking in our group of nine peeps.. We were treated to a well drink at the bar and proceeded on from there to our fleet of busses that were happily awaiting our arrival..with glow sticks and shots..\n\nOur group travelled on the double decker, the more the merrier!! Stripper poles and laser lights, along with top dance hits were playing on the speakers.. and our special little tour guide was dancing around handing us shots anytime we looked anything but happy. I felt like wooed nun and was quickly losing all inhibitions..\n\nOur first stop was 1OAK club at The Mirage.. the club was great and staying just an hour was nice too.. after that, it kinda became sort of a blur of dancing, drinking and general bad behaviour.. and we can just leave all that in Vegas. \n\nIt was a great way to take a group of friends on a VIP tour of Vegas clubs and have some great memories, but NO PIX, to take away with us!",323,4

"This is no more an authentic beer hall than the Tiki Lounge is an authentic Polynesian hut.  But the inside atmosphere is fun and energetic, with people dancing on tables as the band plays polkaized versions of Neil Diamond songs.  It is very very loud, with open seating after 9pm on weekends, so don't expect to have any conversations.  The outside is more chill and is a nice spot to sit along the river.  That said, the two stars are strictly for atmosphere only.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of sitting outside went by with no one taking our orders, we had to chase down a waitress.  The beers are not-so-good.  The wheat is the only decent beer in the lot.  Instead of beers, I'd order a shotski--four shot glasses attached to a ski so all drinkers are forced to take shots in unison...Any shot you can imagine.  As far as the food goes, if you're not getting a pretzel, you'll be disappointed.  That's the only great item on the menu.  The sauerkraut is just awful.  \n\nThe doormen here take their jobs too seriously.  I was startled by two of them yelling \""thief\"" at me after I walked out with my group of co-workers.  Everyone around stopped to stare.  After the doormen said people had been stealing glasses, I showed them my left-overs from dinner were the bugle in my handbag.  The funny part is that I was stone-sober and didn't even order a drink there, so had no glass to steal.  I would have been willing to forgive and forget, but I never got an apology.  So I docked a star for poor service.",367,1
"Wow.  I have NEVER not left a tip but my service was so horrible I put a big fat zero on the tip line.  What astonished me was when I went to give my paid check to the manager to make sure he knew how dissatisfied I was, I was told my horrible server was the manager!\n\nThat being said, the food is great and in the past I enjoyed eating at the sushi bar.  But I will NEVER eat at a table again and I will not take my family (meaning visits will be far and few between).  \n\nIn family centric Anthem, this place will not survive with the current manager at the helm.  With the good food, I hope the problem is remedied soon.\n\nSome specifics on the service:\n- It took forever to get our order taken so I took my boys on a walk while my husband ordered (plus, they failed to give us a pencil for our sushi order sheet).\n- When our first order of sushi came out, we didn't have any sushi sets.  When I asked our waiter/the manager for some, he looked at me like I was crazy and said, you mean the little bowls?  When I tried to also add we needed ginger and wasabi he seemed very confused and finally said, oh ginger.\n- It wasn't until after the tempura, then cucumber salad, then sushi order, and finally the next sushi order that he brought the kids meals out (by then, my kids were fit to be tied!).  He failed to bring a fork and knife.  I waited a bit, and finally ran around the restaurant to find him.  When I did, he said it would take a minute because he was entering in an order (mind you, I had a boy desperately waiting to eat his chicken fingers but the were huge and hot so they needed to be cut, he's 2, and chopsticks were useless to cut the chicken with).  I don't know why he couldn't just ask someone else to get them for me, it isn't often a customer comes and hunts you down, it usually means they are desperate for service!\n- He brought the silverware, and ran off, while our drinks were completely empty.  Had to wave him down again to get water refills.\n- The final straw was at then end.  He asked if we wanted anything else, and three times, I said the check please (anyone could tell at that point I was frustrated and ready to just leave).  He brought the check over (by then, my dad and son had left the restaurant, my husband was packing up my other son).  He then left for a LONG time.  I saw him on the other side of the restaurant just hanging out talking casually with a waitress.  I waited, and waited.  My husband left and I am now all alone at the table.  I get up and try to pay the hostess - can't.  She finally gets the waiter/manager.  But seriously - your a waiter/manager., your customer tells you three times to just bring the check, the table clears out with just one person left who is staring at you WAITING for to pay the bill --- Did I really have to go ask the hostess, and why couldn't the hostess cash me out?!?\n\nThere were 1000 other little things the whole evening that had me tearing my hair out.  In all, I will NEVER return with my family.  That being said, unless I find another sushi place in Anthem, the food is good enough to return to the sushi bar when my husband and I want a quiet night out and Grandpa can babysit the boys.",769,0

"Just got back from a couple of nights in Vegas for a reunion.  The cheapo buddy who organized it, picked the Orleans as lead hotel.  In that I had not seen most of the guys for 10+ years I felt it would be most fun to stay at Orleans.  This is a hotel that is way off the strip, Felt like a much older crowd as opposed to Cosmopolitan where it felt like you were surrounded by 20-somethings.. You need a car or take a taxi ($15-$18) to get to most places.  It is 2.4 miles to Bellagio for example, a bit too far to walk after having drinks.  The rooms are dated, no flat screen tvs, water in bathroom has that sulfur smell, new fixtures saved it a bit.  The room I had was huge,( cost $51 a night which included tax and resort fee)like a mini suite.  Too much second hand smoke walking around casino, sportsbook and restaurants, no real bar/night life other than gambling.  Does have a movie theatre and bowling alley as part of the complex.  Food and drinks cheaper than the strip for sure.  Would I stay here again, probably not, the savings on room, is lost on cost of cabs and lack of other nightlife.",273,1

The place itself is small, but that's the only thing that is! This place is ridiculously chock full of personality. From amazing food, to staff who really know their drinks, to Shipwreck, it's definitely worth checking out. Everything is made fresh and there is NO microwave anything!

"This is the first Mariana's Supermarket I have visited since becoming a Las Vegas local.  In fact, I have been coming to this supermarket on and off for the past few years since I started taking classes at the Cheyenne campus of College of Southern Nevada.  It is a convenient location for grocery shopping for fresh produce, ethnic grocery items from south of the border that may be hard to find in your local Smith's or Vons.\n\nThe best part about Mariana's is their juice bar. They serve smoothies made from fresh fruits, fresh cut fruits, horchata, and other Mexican or Spanish-origin beverages.  They also have a service deli counter where you can order tacos, burritos, and one or two entr\u00e9e combination plates, or purchase items by weight.  I tried their Lengua (tongue meat) and a large smoothie made with fresh squeezed orange juice and chunks of fresh pineapple, both were $3.99 each or $4.31 after tax.  The Lengua burrito was okay (I prefer Roberto's), and was filled with the tongue meat, rice, corn, beans, guacamole, etc, and is pretty filling.  But the fresh fruit smoothie is a great value, healthy and delicious.\n\nTheir bakery prepares baked goods i am not familiar with, and also have a selection of cakes for just about any occasion. It looks to be on par with the offerings at the other main stream grocery stores, and the quality of their baker's decorating skills is nothing to rave about, but they do get the job done. Plus most shoppers will probably not even notice that the quality can be improved with a little more attention to detail or training. \n\nIf you are planning to prepare Mexican dinner and don't have the time to marinate the meats, they have a good selection of marinated meats for a reasonable price. As far as fruits, the prices are reasonable to cheap, and for the most part very fresh.  If you are in the North Las Vegas area, check out this Mariana's or one that is closer to you.\n\nHappy shopping!",443,3
"Great date place, great place to hang with friends.  A good chance to experience a variety of flavors without stuffing yourself silly.\n\nThe food was excellent, across the board.

"I don't like Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nBut my husband LOVES it. Absolutely loves it. He thinks it is downright hilarious.\n\nSo when we booked our hotel and plane tickets to Vegas, I just knew we had to go see Spamalot. Their last show is July 13, 2008 - so this was our chance. Note: half price tix are available through Goldstar, so sign up for Goldstar Events.\n\nI decided I might like this version of the Holy Grail because it's in musical form, and I love musicals. I wanted more than just silly Bristish humour (like how I spelled it with an 'our'?) and deadpan jokes. And it was surprisingly funny and fresh! It had fun dancing, silly sets, a wonderful leading lady (used to sing in the traveling version of The Lion King musical), and a talented cast.\n\nAny seat on the main level is great, since the theater is small. So snag tickets anywhere. Our aisle wasn't packed full, so we had breathing room.\n\nThe catchy tunes were ringing in my head for a few days afterward, and I found myself whistling along. The show is almost completely ripped off from MP and the Holy Grail, or other Monty Python sketches - so if you're a fan you'll love it. And if you like upbeat silly musicals, you'll like it too. Don't buy tix full price though, it's not worth it. Definitely worth 1/2 price though!\n\n\""I fart in your general direction!\""",342,3

Not the way to do it. Egg is an integral part of the recipe, not an add-on to pretend this is breakfast too. I tried to eat it but simply could not; even after dousing it with olive oil. There was no sauce; no moisture. Besides, the egg pasta was too thick. \n\nServer did a good job. I asked to speak to the manager. She was gracious and, to her credit, comped my dinner and gave us a free desert. Class act. \n\nBut that was the last time. If you have patronized this place over the years before it was sold, you can now forget them. Do not waste your money.",304,0
Curbside valet is terrible. With the parking deck down its slow and backed up. $18/day for terrible service and a 2 hour wait?! Child please! Not sure what I should've expected though from a bunch of teenagers and a manager who appears to not care. DO  NOT USE. Maybe if we stop using them they'll get the message.,78,0
I will miss you! This place was AWESOME. Off the strip so prices coincided with quality and quantity of food. some hit and miss menu items but crawfish risotta is absolute CRACK! and lamb with kalmatta olive mash....freaking DOPE! Alas another great establishment bites the dust...its always the good ones that go first.,69,4
"We just left Bentley's for V Day. They had a preset menu for this evening which was 150 dollars per couple. We also ordered wine which made it over 200. Our view was great and the jazz music was nice. However, the head waiter left a lot to be desired. The assistant waiter should have been the head waiter because he knew how to conduct himself the way a waiter in a restaurant of this caliber should. It took us half a hour to have our order taken. Our appetizers arrived half a hour later and our meal arrived a hour later. The assitant waiter was the only one who asked us how our meal was. The hostess and the assistant waiter were the only ones who made us feel welcomed. The head waiter acted as if he was doing us a favor to acknowledge us. We spoke to the owner as we were leaving about the situation. He really acted as though he could care less.",191,1
The pharmacy has limited hours on weekends.  Went Sunday morning at 1030 to pick up called in prescriptions.  The guy at the counter said that they only had 1 of my 2 called in prescriptions and that I had to hand carry in my other prescription.   I get on the phone with my Dr's office and as soon as the nurse answers the guy says never mind I found it in the system.  Then he said my cough medicine and Z PAC wouldn't be ready until noon.  So we head home and come back at 1:30 and sit in the drive through for 10 min until we are helped.  Then they tell us they still don't have it ready and it will be another 20 min.  So I told them to cancel my prescription and I went to Walgreens.,175,0
Adobada is ah-mazing! Wedge Salad is also really good. Kinda felt like I was in Santa Fe for a bit...I highly recommend this place!,34,4
"I have been here a number of times; there is not many food choices in the Northwest. Yesterday I came here for breakfast with a friend. I like their breakfast overall. The have later breakfast hours than most places, although only offered on weekends. It is about $10 per entree, however, it appeared popular as there were many families and kids eat free for breakfast. I have had the hash and eggs here, the hash is made there, but I will say it isn't traditional it is more like chopped up brisket - and I like it although I wouldn't really call it hash.  This last time I had the chili cheese omelet and pancakes. They have huge portions, and I don't know if the pancakes were a mix, probably, but they were good and hot. The omelet was tasty, a decent amount of melted cheese and good chili.   I will say that the hash browns were frozen which was a down side. The country potatoes are made there (at least per asking before) but they were kind of mushy before so I didn't get them. I have been here for dinner before too - not my favorite BBQ but pretty good brisket and again they are good enough that I would go back. The sides are lacking - the corn tastes frozen and I don't have anything that really sticks out as a decent side, but overall due to the meat I like it, and they have brewed ice tea.",296,3
"Ok, I came to this place expecting nothing less than GREAT, I was disappointed, the restaurant was beautiful, the service was fine but the food was so salty that we only took two bites, I never complaint to the wait staff and I didn't do it this time either, but when they came to clear our plates and saw that we barely touch our food they didn't ask if anything was wrong, just assume we weren't hungry? I'm really disappointed... :-(",99,1
"If they didn't have their deal of $56 for two nights in a two-bedroom suite, with a free bottle of alcohol included, I probably would not have come here. Quite honestly, this is the \""cheapest\"" hotel I've been to in Vegas, but when you're out celebrating with some friends and you're not planning to stay in the hotel for long, this is a good place to be.\n\nCome on, $56 for two nights? In Vegas? On The Strip? With free alcohol? That's an amazing plus! I was actually super satisfied with the location, since it's right across from great hotels like Caesar's Palace and Bellagio. It's also within reasonable walking distance from other hotels like Aria, The Venetian, and New York New York.\n\nOn the downside, the layout of the place is confusing -- Mark S. and I had a room in Tower 4, and it took forever to walk there until we found out a shortcut. Even with the shortcut, it'd take forever to get to our rooms because EVERYONE was using the same elevator to get to their rooms on different towers. Yikes. Not to mention that the rooms are really basic -- just a step above Holiday Inn or motels. Pretty warm in the casino, too, in general. Customer service isn't the best, either.\n\nStill, you get what you pay for, and IP actually did go beyond my expectations for its incredibly cheap price. But if you plan to impress someone or if you want to \""go big,\"" look anywhere else on The Strip but this place.",341,1

"My review will be for the Grooming site within this Petco location. I took my dog into Petco Grooming for the second time to be groomed and the appointment was at 2pm. I thought I'd shop the store and wait for my dog during her appointment. It couldn't take more than 45 minutes to an hour, right? Nope! Once I was done shopping around the store I went to check the progress of the groom. The groomer was gone and I could see my dog in a kennel waiting to be serviced. Also, my dog is a rescue and is afraid of being in a kennel, cage, crate. I continued to wait and the groomer returned at 3pm. She said, \""Oh, have you been waiting the entire time? A groom takes two to three hours.\"" I wasn't sure how to respond because I was upset but I didn't want her to know and then rush through the groom or \""accidentally\"" clip my dog. I asked her when she thought she'd be done and she said, \""I'm off at 4 so she'll be done by then.\"" Ok, she'd be done in AN HOUR. \nI headed home without my dog at 3pm and then had to return at 4pm when the initial appointment was at 2. I thought it was ridiculous for the groomer to schedule an appointment clearly during her lunch break. Sheesh!!! \nAll in all, she did an ok job on the groom. I would give a lower star rating for the grooming portion because of the lack of customer service, but I'll return to the store because other Petco employees were fantastic and helpful. It's too bad because the first time I visited the Petco groomers last June it was such a positive experience, it's close to home and reasonably priced. I'll visit this Petco again, but I will be seeking a new groomer. Bad scheduling and bad customer service speaks volumes.",414,2
We typically go to the one at 10th st. and camelback which is the best in the valley.  We live right by this one and they have done a much better job recently.  Great spicy food.,47,3

"I took my S2000 here for an alignment on a recommendation from a friend, and I'm so glad that I did! The gentlemen working the front desk was chipper and talkative. When I mentioned the car I was asking them to service, the tech that was in the office stretched his arms out and said, \""My friend, you've come to the right place.\"" It turns out the tech is a fellow Honda/Acura enthusiast and sounded almost excited to help me out!\n\nHe drove the car onto the rack slowly, minding the lowered nature of the S2K. While he was doing his work we discussed all things Honda. He did not mind that I was in the shop, under the lift (inspecting the undercarriage), giving my car a once-over. Meanwhile, he's doing his job efficiently while giving me advice on how to modify it and get the most of a wonderful driving machine. \n\nPretty much, I'm happy as can be that I found a fellow enthusiast working right around the corner, who I know it out to do the best job he can on my vehicle. Definitely a reassuring feeling.\n\nWith all that being said, and as happy as I was with the service he, and the shop, had extended to me, the reason I am writing this review and rated it as such is because of the treatment I witnessed them giving other customers.\n\nWe've all had bad experiences with an auto shop at one time of another, and it seems like they can prey on women (who typically don't have the knowledge of cars your average Joe would). As I was in the waiting room, the gentleman at the counter, as well as another tech, were talking with a woman about her car, fully explaining the situation she was in, giving her numerous options to take care of her vehicle's problems. Although they weren't directing this honesty and service my way, I really appreciated seeing it and made a mental note.\n\nBased on how they treated me, and the other customers in their shop, I would recommend Tucker Tire highly!",441,4

"Found this little gem today while taking my son on a tour of the ASU campus. Neat little restaurant just off College Avenue. Had the grilled chicken sandwich on a multi-grain bun with grilled onions, lettuce, tomatos, and mustard. You can choose about twenty different options to add to it off of the menu. Tried the chillie fries, but they wern't very good. Over cooked and they had no flavor. The sandwich is the main issue here. Really good, and the grilled onions are fantastic! I didn't have a milkshake, but I did notice that they are \""real milkshakes.\"" I saw the ice cream and milk being added to the mixing cup. The place itself was pretty small inside, but there are tables outside to eat off of. The inside was very clean. Nice option to the Chuck Box just around the corner which is usually packed, so this was a great choice.",187,3
"Holy Huge waffles batman!\n\n\nThe place is Imperial Palace, which is a really shady and old casino. Good thing they're remodeling it. Hopefully Hash House will be cleaner and newer looking too. As of right now it is like old vegas or reno feel to it. \n\nThe food is OK. The portions are ridiculous. Got the Waffle and man its bigger than the wheels on my car!!! No way I can finish. too bad the taste wasn't as big. \n\nThe wait wasn't too bad, but the food took FOREVER to come out! It wasn't even that busy. Oh well, hopefully they can fix this once it remodels too.",147,1
"Good Tex-Mex in Old Town Scottsdale. I enjoyed it. The service wasn't the best, but our meals were good. Chips and salsa were just ok.\n\nThe must try are the sopapillias (sp?). Great stuff with honey.\n\nHowever the building itself and atmosphere was nice and I enjoyed the patio seating.",73,2
"A lot smaller than I thought, so trying to cram in and find a seat is next to impossible; the people with laptops studying usually don't leave very often.

"I am definitely starting to like dining on farms. It makes me feel like I'm supporting the local economy and also getting fresh food.\n\nWe came here before our flight out of Phoenix, yesterday, in lieu of dining at the Morning Glory Cafe. Once we left downtown Phoenix for S. Mountain, the wait had increased by 30 minutes making the wait one hour, which would make us cut too close to our flight back to San Francisco.\n\nSo we walked back all the way to the front of the farm and decided to grab lunch here. True, the selection is sparse, but the ingredients are fresh. Someone mentioned that he didn't understand why it's so expensive. Well, I think I do. This is a small farm--they don't mass produce their product, so of course things are going to be more expensive. To top it off, they are a sustainable farm, so things come at a price.\n\nAnyway, back to my review. I decided to try the red grape and walnut salad, which consisted of grilled chicken, mixed greens, red grapes, walnuts and gorgonzola crumbles served with a raspberry vinaigrette. I also opted to get the passion fruit iced tea, which was delicious without any added sweetness!\n\nThe salads are already pre-packed, but they were fresh. The sandwiches are made to order. My friend got the old fashioned turkey sandwich (Grill roasted pulled turkey, organic fi eld greens and house made cranberry relish with chipotle mayo on multi-grain bread). I was able to try the sandwich and it was soooo good. Very delicious and fresh. My salad was also very good and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could taste the difference in the freshness.\n\nI just really enjoyed the freshness of everything and I'm looking forward to coming back to eat here AND at the Morning Glory Cafe on my next trip back to Phoenix. Can't wait! I love farm-fresh dining!",405,3
"we have not been here in a long time and after this visit, I can guarantee it will NOT be long before we return. The food was AWESOME, the prices a steal for the customer as the food is so awesome, I am sure they could charge more, BUT DON'T!!!\n\nWe have NEVER been disappointed here.  This place has gone through some staff changes over the years, but the quality has never changed.  If you want a gourmet meal, you can count on this place.  \n\nThis is a TRUE HIDDEN GEM which I am not talking about on YELP, what is wrong with me.  This place deserves a 5 star and if you have the opportunity to visit this place, you will be happy you did.  The butternut squash soup, to die for, the NY Steak cooked to perfection, the Halibut amazing gourmet and the bread???  Bring stretchy pants when you go here because you will want more and more and more.  \n\nMake sure you leave room for the desert as it is just as amazing as the food.  If you leave here disappointed, its your fault.  When the crowd died down the chef even came out of the kitchen to say hello and see how things were.  The staff is just amazing and Tony at the door treats you like you are family.  What a great place, great people and great food.  There are a lot of regulars and this place and I think I will become one as well.",311,4
"i was a little disapointed with this place. if you're paying 40 dollars, its defintely not worth it. i am, however, comparing this to the buffet at bellagios. bellagios is much better. let me break this down piece by piece.\n\nsalads- not too much of a variety. pretty small salad bar. but i did like the barley salad, that was nice.\n\nfish- i was bit disappointed with the sea bass, it was defintely over cooked, same with the catfish. however, the one good fish was the red snapper. eat that one.\n\nmeats- it has all the standards. most of the meats tasted overdone. the only one that was worth getting seconds was the prime rib. \n\nseafood - the crab legs were disappointing. defintely defintely tasted frozen and thawed out. to make things worse there was a long line. shrimp also tasted like they were cooked, then frozen, then thawed. typical standard fare of smoked salmon and california rolls. \n\nmiscellaneous - well the mashed potatoes were really good! i always get in trouble for eating mashed potatoes at buffets.. my mom yells at me and says i should eat something more expensive =)\n\ndesserts - i didn't get a chance to eat the gelato cuz there were too many people. but u could make sundaes with them. the other stuff was knda good. lotsa pies, pudding type desserts.\n\nthe service was realy good. what a buncha cheap guys not to tip!!!\n\nso overall the place is deifntely not worth 40 dollars. good thing we got vouches and each only paid half. mosey yourselves over to bellagio's buffet instead.",379,2
"Had just flown into Phoenix on a long flight.  Tired and hungry, we turned to Yelp to locate something fairly convenient to our route and lucked out in finding this place!  The staff is friendly and helpful and as soon as you walk in the door, the amazing smell that takes you over lets you know you are in for something really good.  Ambiance is nice, casual, warm and inviting. \n\n We ordered their version of the meat lovers pizza to split and it was ridiculously good.  Impressive stone pizza oven in the corner produces thin, crispy pizza that is just the way i like it.  Looked like a lot of the ingredients were imported, which added to the authentic taste.  Free powdered sugar dusted fry bread at the end of the meal that was the perfect ending to a really satisfying meal.  Will keep this in mind for future trips to Phoenix and definitely recommend you check it out.",189,4
Awesome place to relax and have a beer and some food.  Lots of screens to watch sports and lots of beer choices to choose from on tap.

"Holy fried seafood, Batman.  Between the Singapore Calamari, Bang Bang Shrimp, and Fish and Chips, I think I've had my fill of fried food for a while.  \n\nWe started with the Singapore Calamari and Bang Bang Shrimp for appetizers.  The calamari is generic, with too much breading for my tastes.  It does come with some fried peppers, which was a nice treat.  The Bang Bang Shrimp is their most popular appetizer, and consisted of crunchy breaded shrimp in a very mild sauce.  Both the calamari and shrimp were supposed to have a spicy sauce, but on a scale of 1-10 they were both probably a 0.5.  A positive is that the portion sizes are very generous; if you're not sharing, it could be an entree for one.\n\nI opted for Sir Will's Fish and Chips because the description said it was tempura style, and because the fish was tilapia instead of the usual cod.  The fish itself was really good, nice and juicy and again, generous portions.  Sadly, the batter was less tempura style and more Long John Silver's style; a giant block of fried batter that encased a filet of fish.  Crunchy and thick, it didn't do anything for the fish.\n\nI don't think Bonefish Grill would ever be my first choice if I'm at Town Square, but I also wouldn't dismiss it if someone else wanted to try it.  Based on the tilapia in the fish and chips, I'd want to try their grilled fish entrees.",340,2
"Delicious! Of course ive been relying on yelp for restaurant navigation and everyone wanted breakfast. Our hostess was such a sweetie!  She had a great sense of humor.   And our waiter was fun and on top of things. Our bill was bout $70 and we left a $20 tip because all of us liked him. Our food was really good. With our breakfast, we had these potato chip style potatoes w/seasonings. Yum! A must try is their homemade pumpkin bread...they serve it warm and give u butter. Even my picky mom enjoyed it!  She stole some of mine and then changed her order to pumpkin bread.  There are a million omelet choices (as if you couldnt guess that by the restaurant name).",153,4
"Grabby hands. I get all grabby hands when I stop by Frock Shop Style Lounge. It's bad enough when I salivate over the Frock Shop Pop Up Shops, but it's even more appealing when the racks are available to shop at your whim! \n\nInside MONA, Frock Shop is set up in a small space but packs a ton of punch. You'll spy a small selection of expertly picked vintage and resale goodies: blouses, dresses, accessories, handbags, shoes & more. I plucked a few items to try on in the back and left with a lovely silk shift and woven belt for just $50. \n\nThe owner, Caroline, is as sweet as can be and just pleased to help you find something fabulous.

We had a group-on, and he needed to change the Price because of Tuesday \""deals\"", and it ended up costing us more to use the group-on, then to just pay out of pocket. So we asked for the manager.\n\nWOAH. A Completely unprofessional Bald man approached us and began to RAISE his voice while telling us he does not agree with us on questioning the bill.

"What a huge disappointment. We went here because we thought we would get a great sandwich, we were wrong. There were 8 of us and every one of us did not like our sandwiches. All of our sandwiches had little to no flavor and all were awful. I would not recommend this place to anyone. It is clear that this restaurant is not a priority to any of its owners and that they must have never eaten here. We had a lof of variety in our sandwiches between the 8 of us so it was across the board just a failure and I am typically pretty forgiving of food/restaurants. Save your money and go elsewhere.",129,0
"This is my favorite restaurant to go in Champaign, and if something particularly good happens to me, this is where we go to celebrate.  You have to order carefully, it is true.  The pork barbecue is good, the rainbow trout is pretty good if not fried, but the main reason to go is the GREENS.  They have flecks of meat in them which is what makes them good.  This is the reason that i like southern cooking.  The biscuits and cornbread are also very good.  I would avoid all other of their meat entrees, particularly their meatloaf which has a really weirdly fluffy and light consistency, as if meat had been aerated and transformed into a different substance with different properties, and the \""chicken n noodles,\"" which is like condensed chicken soup from a can, but with extra slime.  Beef stew is a disaster; even the waitress described it as \""fatty.\""  \n\nDesserts are insanely huge and can be shared if you are a family of 4.  Three of us all had a go at the apple dumpling and barely made a dent in it. It went back looking more or less the same as when it arrived.  The thing I like the most about this place is its multicultural democratic bent. Despite the downhome theme of this place, which might seem off-putting if you are not a white person from the midwest, I have always had excellent service here.  It is also the only restaurant in our town that I have seen that has both a white and a black clientele (I have never seen Asian people here, except for some people who were clearly part of a bus tour and therefore not there of their own free will).",351,3
"We came for a first-time double date with another couple. The experience is on par with other brazilian steakhouses and the general rule is you have a round chip that you flip to the orange side if you'd like more meat. Black side means no thank you.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal here because of the attentive service, and the excellent quality of food we were served. My favorite cuts were the top sirloin (as other Yelpers have highlighted), the flank steak, and the pork ribs. I liked the ribs so much that I requested more from our waitress and she was nice enough to expedite the next round. The salad bar is also very good quality - selections included heart of palms, arugula, roasted artichoke, seafood salad (meh), quinoa and edamame, etc. I really enjoyed the salsa vinaigrette, which goes really well with the grilled steaks.\n\nOne thing we learned that was not super evident from the menu, is that you can get the swordfish and salmon that come around if you get salad bar only. For around $25, that is not an overly excessive/pricey meal. It's just if you get tempted by the smell of grilled meat, then be ready to shell out the full $50.\n\nThe only downside with our meal was that our conversations kept getting interrupted by the constant questions about whether we wanted more cuts. I'm not complaining, as it really speaks to their prime service, but this might not be a good place to come if you want to have lengthy conversations with your company.",326,2
"March Madness - had peeps in town for the craziness and people let me tell ya - the Strip was mardi gra-esque on friday/saturday.  \n\nGot lucky and scored a free room at Caesar's and one at my fav local casino , Gold Coast.

"Wow.  Amazing.  Simply amazing.  When you see a live band, normally there might be one or two weak links... perhaps the drummer is just average, or maybe the guitar player is a bit mushy... not so this band.  The drummer, Nick can play the skins; the keyboardist, Johnathan, is masterful; the Bass player, Todd, is one of the best I've seen; and there are simply not enough superlatives to describe the lead guitar, Brian.  Which leaves the two front \""men\"", Caleb and Christine.  \n\nThis group covers every genre, from Lady Gaga to Neil Diamond, AC/DC to Prince, and they do it flawlessly.

"I hadn't been to this restaurant in over 4 years. From what I remembered, it was one of the best Thai place in the city so I was looking forward to go back! In the end, it was overall a good meal but still a disappointment! \n\nI would say the food is still pretty good and flavorful in general. For appetizer, we had a duck salad which was a little bit sour. Too much lime and I didn't like the fact that it was minced duck. I would have much rather preferred sliced duck. We then had the pad thai (only 2 shrimps) and the chicken with peanut sauce with crispy spinach, both very good.\n\nWhy 3 stars? First I thought the service was very slow. We were the only ones in the restaurant. I understand there was a big take out order but still! Second, the bill came to close to 60$ for 1 appetizer, 2 main dishes and 1 bowl of rice!  I don't expect to pay this much for an Asian restaurant (beside sushi). I just think they've been taking advantage of their success in the last few years to raise their prices.",247,1

I must admit that I was surprised at the price of a 'nothing special' cup of coffee - 2.95 for coffee at a breakfast joint is over priced IMO.  I would much rather have spent that money on a Starbucks - at least I would have gotten some enjoyment out of my coffee!  I've heard that the food is good, it had better be darn good for the prices that they charge.  \n\nIf you're going out for coffee and a muffin, this is not the place to go.",213,1
Here I was thinking for some bizarre reason that their carne asada would be better than morenos or mi casita in chandler and boy was I wrong.

Their carne asada had a very weird texture or lack of I should say with very little flavor or crispiness in the slightest its almost like they boiled it and threw it on the stove and swished it around til it got hot but not crisp obviously.\n\nIf their carne asada was amazing id be in heaven with how ginormous the size of those things are. I wish someone would have warned me that they are no where near street taco size they are like street tacos on steroids.  I am in love with the usual street tacos because my stomach will only allow a max of 3 in my stomach at a time.  The pico de gallo has a lot of minced jalapenos so beware. My spicy tolerance is slowly diminishing where I can no longer handle extreme heat like that. I do happen to like their red sauce though  it is spicy enough for me to handle to dip my not as spicy food into to add the heat with each bite.  \n\nNot much to really say besides I wasted a lot of money for two tacos. So overpriced and the longest wait known to man for 2 tacos. 30 minutes for 2 tacos is crazy.  I understand you are busy but 30 minutes really?\n\nI doubt ill ever return to this establishment.,328,1
"Rick the Pool Dude is the main dude I would trust with my pool. I've had some issues with previous companies and Rick is the most knowledgable of the business. From a minor leak I had to maintaining my pool, Rick does a great job.  He is prompt and gets the job done how it should be. I wouldn't call anyone else but Rick the Pool Dude.",80,4
"I really wanted to like this place. It's my favorite type of food, after all. But, for the price and the hype, it kept leaving me disappointed. We both got a cocktail - I got the michelada verde. They were ok, despite the fact that the lime garnish was browning. We ordered from the happy hour menu and the regular menu - Kiwi-lime salmon ceviche (good, but was missing something), shrimp tostadas (ok, but very salty), and two little pigs (everything was cold, and the pork belly was way over salted, like biting into a greasy slab of salt). At least the service and ambiance were good!",136,1
"I am seriously craving those little toasts with the two kinds of spreadable cheese they bring you before your meal at Flemmings right now.  DEAR GOD do you think you can get that to go?\n\nI have had a fantastic experience every time I've been to Flemmings.  Great, sophisticated atmosphere with waiters who know their food and their wine.  Great wine selection, btw.  \n\nI always have the filet there and its always cooked to perfection, along with the asparagus and blue cheese mashed potatos...holy crap--DELISH.  \n\nGreat upscale date place...I've also seen groups handled well here too.",139,4
"I think the cheese pizza was great.  Because of it's popularity, there's probably a high turnover, so they probably keep bringing in the hot pies.  As for the other pies sitting there, they don't have that hot out of the oven taste.  The pepper and pepperoncini pizza was not good at all.  Not as hot as the cheese, and the taste of the pepperoncini  kills that pizza taste.  So for the taste itself, one great slice of the cheese, and one horrible slice of the combo, and factoring the high price ($4.75 for the cheese and $6+ for the combo, it was a little disappointing.  Stick with the cheese slice, and you'll be happy.  It's pretty good, but I don't have that urge to go back.",175,3
"Armitage is located on Market Street in a prime location in DC Ranch.  I know this area has lost some of it's \""lure\"" due to the economy, but you'll still find some good car and people watching on the patio at this restaurant.  \n\nThe typical wine connesuir will want to love Armitage, but after looking at the menu I am sure they will be disappointed.  DC Ranch is a very upscale area so you would think that the owners/management would have a wine list that is well diversified and not outdated.   I also would like to encourage the staff to know more about the wines that they are selling.   Nothing is worse then going to a wine bar and the server gives you that blank look when you ask about different varietals on their list.\n\nOverall this place has one of the best patios I have been to in the Phoenix area, which I would give 4 1/2 stars, but the service and wine list is lackluster.",212,2
"I don't try new hamburger stands, I guess the reason why, is I feel out of place. Everyone is so busy here, I wouldn't have known the peanuts were free, or what was expected when you place an order. The person talking the order was perturbed by my ignorance, and was willing to express it. The food was good, but very greasy and I loved the fries. The price was a little more than it was worth. The price four cheese burgers and 3 fries, no drinks was $34.85. It is better to eat everything there, the food gets cold if you have to travel and distance at all.",135,2
"From their unique organic teas and fruit juice selections, to their fresh fully stocked salad bar, this place has me SOLD! I'm not usually in the Scottsdale area, so it was a nice surprise to stumble upon this wonderful market and grab a healthy.  I was surprised at how inexpensive it was, and still so fresh! I will definitely be back many a nights before class to indulge on the (did I mention fresh?) Salad bar ;-)",90,4
"This place was delicious!  I had the ahi tacos and a side order of french fries (because I'm a fry addict), and both were fantastic.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive, and you even get a free cookie on your way out the door!  I would definitely go back.",64,4
Good place to go if you're hungry and don't want to cook breakfast.  Not great due to the fact that most of their food is straight from the freezer to the frying pan and just so-so.  Small portions of bland food.  Great people and great service.  Just altogether blah food.,66,1
"Everything went great until we got to the room and found BED BUGS in our bed!!! My boyfriend called the front desk to let them now and the only thing they would offer us was a new room. There was blood on our sheets from the bed bugs and previous occupants, and yet the staff was not accommodating or willing to comp our room. There was a fire in one of the rooms while we were staying and we all had to be evacuated for an hour. This was a horrible place to stay and I am surprised it has not been shut down yet!!!",113,0
First off.. Guy Fieri is a f*cking liar.  Nothing was good about the place. Was going to give this place a whopping 2 stars until the owner went around and ask damn nearly every person in the restaurant how they were and how their food was.. but didnt come to our table.  Racist. My eggs were under cooked and i couldnt chew through my chicken fried steak.  No go.  Matt ' s big breakfast is the way to go.,98,0
"Lululemon makes a high quality product but I only wish their staff represented the same level of quality. We have spent thousands at this particular store, and normally it's a good experience. The staff usually isn't very outgoing and cluster around chatting with eachother which isn't a huge deal since I prefer not to be bugged while I shop anyways. Where I do expect better service from staff is when I have a specific customer service issue. Tonight (12/20/13) we entered the store and explained to the sales clerk, Angela Russell, that we would like to exchange a pair of pants that was purchased as a gift but did not fit right. The waistband of the pants felt tight and different than some of the other pants in the same size. Since these pants were also a gift, we cleanly cut away the tag and kept it so that the price wasn't on display to the person we were giving it to (or those around them when they opened their gift). We had no intentions of needing to return these pants with the consistent fit that other lululemon product offers. We were told by Angela (who turns out to also be the STORE MANAGER) that she \""could not\"" accept the pants because the tag was removed. Mind you, the pants were never worn other than trying them on, still had the original fold and creases, and were purchased just a few days prior. We explained that we understood this was their policy but were looking to do a exchange for greater value (we had additional clothes we wanted to buy) and that the tags were removed because it was a gift. Angela continued to talk to us and asked repetitive questions about our purchase, while always coming back to the same excuse that she could not take the pants back. I'm not sure who trained her as a Manager, but her way of dealing with our request was extremely poor. I began taking offense to the fact that she was standing there talking to us in front of other customers as if she was offering a solution, but rather was talking us around in circles perhaps waiting until we'd get tired and leave. I expect a store manager to either offer a compromise or solution to the customer or inform the customer of the strict return policy and leave it at that. There is no reason whatsoever to waste a customer's evening and belittle a customer for simply coming into a store and requesting an exchange. We have gone to this store (and many others in AZ and CA) and have even taken back worn yoga pants that we felt were a little too see-through when bending over in them with NO QUESTIONS ASKED. There is absolutely no reason that a pair of BRAND NEW loose-fitting men's pants couldn't be taken back and either defected out (we did complain the waist band felt awfully tight compared to others after all) or re-tagged and put back onto the shelf if they were deemed to not be defective. When I asked Angela for the name and number of her supervisor, she replied that she was THE Store Manager and the only point of contact above her was Lululemon's \""Guest Education Center\"". I find it very hard to believe that there is no one overseeing Angela's performance as a Manager other than a corporate hotline. Either way, I'd love for someone at LuLulemon Corporate to contact me and tell me that this particular manager handled the situation to their standards. If so, the future isn't looking so bright for lululemon regardless of how great their products are. At the end of the day, one employee that you PAY to MANAGE and provide CUSTOMER SERVICE, ruined your brand for a pair of loyal customers that have already spent several thousand dollars and had no reason not to spend thousands more... until tonight.\n\nUPDATE (12/21/13) - Brought the pair of pants to the store at Fashion Square Mall and was able to exchange the pants for a jacket with no questions asked! I was in and out in 5 minutes despite the store being completely packed with Holiday shoppers. In less time than my experience above, I was able to leave satisfied and I spent an additional $50. My advice to shoppers that want to purchase lululemon product...head over to one of their other locations, particularly if you need to be helped in any way. My advice to Angela Russell (Store Manager of the Biltmore location)....see if your company offers a Management Education Center and take a few courses in Customer Service.",912,0
"I have lived at Mozart for 3 years now. Like anywhere else, there are pros and cons. Pro's first. I like to live a very quiet life. I work from home and I value my privacy. Mozart has always been good, and now has improved on that. When Maintenance comes I get warning, if there's a hazard or problem it gets fixed fast and usually at my choice of day and time, and the OUTSIDE is gorgeous. The guys who work and garden.... they do a meticulous, and fantastic job. So often people who do \"" Small jobs\"" are forgotten so they don't work hard. But house keeping, gardening, and the fix it guys are always respectful, friendly, and are highly knowledgeable.  \n\nCons: Rent.... goes up every year to almost a ridiculous amount. I live in a studio and without utilities besides water and heat) it's over 600. However: I get this is a business and anything money related Mozart is a stickler on. Still: if they did some rent control... they could keep some really good clients. Sometimes I think that gets forgotten.  I'll have to leave next year, and who knows, I might rent another place w these guys.  But for now, I'm going to make the best of my time.",275,3
"i don't have too much to say about this vue cinema actually, but it seems pretty a-ok to me.  on a thursday night it was pretty empty so there were not queues at the automated ticket machines on the ground floor.  i was surprised that for a cinema that services the majority of the new town and east end of edinburgh there was only three ticket machines and the other ticket windows were closed.  this probably lends itself to causing queues on busiers nights such as orange wednesdays.  however, you can buy tickets at the concession stands if you want to buy popcorn and drinks at the same time.\n\nthere are a decent number of theatres for showing movies and this cinema has all the new releases.  however, it does seem a bit tired as it is used quite a bit so could do with a bit of a face lift (new carpets and seats in the theatre).  the staff are pleasant and it's a convenient location, so really no complaints.  however, i still prefer the vue at ocean terminal so only three stars for this branch.",222,2

"Such yummy poutine. It's such big portion-- I wish I could have shared it with someone. I think I ate half of it and was done. The drawback was that they charged extra for me to box up the food, but I guess you have to make sacrifices for future promises of yumminess I guess.",67,3
"In designing The Buffet at The Wynn, Steve Wynn and his team have endeavored to convince us that we are classy people, dining in a classy establishment, and definitely not a bunch of gluttons shoveling calorie-rich platefuls of heterogenous cuisine into our faces. But, while the floral arrangements and pretty finishings typical of The Wynn are a nice touch, they shouldn't be fooling anyone. \n\nThe Wynn Buffet is mainly about quantity. With 10-15 different food stations, running the gamut from Chinese congee to US comfort food, it definitely delivers on the core promise of any buffet. More importantly, though, The Wynn has managed to up the ante quality-wise, even if many of the individual dishes fail to perform when taken in isolation. The prime rib was good, as was maple-battered fried chicken, and the bakery is a sweet tooth's dream/diabetic's nightmare. We waited just over an hour for the Saturday brunch buffet. While fairly long, this seems to be pretty standard for Vegas buffets (and for popular brunch spots), and if you're particularly impatient you can pay an extra $15 to skip the line. \n\nOn the downside, many of the individual items on offer aren't particularly tasty, and are basically an example of \""quantity over quality.\"" Spend your appetite wisely, and avoid average offerings like wood-fire pizza and the pancake & omelet stations. We also found the speed of service overly slow at times, as plates and utensils mounted up on the table before being cleared.",322,2

One of my least favourite airports any where.  For such a busy airport it lakes almost no dining choices beyond fast food.  There is nearly no shopping options.  The airport design is pretty haggard and outmoded.  The walls on its many hallways are benign.  Apparently the airport authority has never heard of art work or at least windows at a viewing level for natural sunlight in many of the dullest parts of the airport.,90,0

Pricing is reasonable, and service was good.\n\nThe -'s:\n\nThe place is not well lit (maybe a just my impression as lighting has a very real effect on TV viewing) and since it is a gaming/over 21 establishment, it was a little too smoky for my liking (something I should have known in advance-so my bad).

"Ehhhh, more like 2 1/2 for me.  I think it was just because Yelp made it seem like it was the best thing on the strip!  \n\nWell, maybe my opinion is skewed because I got a breakfast sandwich, which was not great at all.  The saving grace?  It was RIGHT next to our room and it was priced very very fairly.  \n\nFood: I got the Bacon, egg, and Swiss breakfast sandwich.   It was early in the morning and we had all been drinking. The sandwich came out PIPING hot. I thought that I was going to bite into it and be struck with inspiration to go and do something with my life.  All I got was a mediocre \""ehhhh\"".  I mean don't get me wrong, would I go out and get it again?  Yup, since it's so convenient.  I like my bacon crispy.  It wasn't crispy.  I guess I just had unreal expectations from yelp reviews.  \n\nPrice:  This probably earned the 3 stars rather than the 2 stars.  I think that it was VERY VERY reasonable.  After losing 90 bucks the night before, the last thing I wanted to do was shell out another 12 bucks for a breakfast sandwich.  \n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI guess I'll just go and try it again.

"We all have our favorite burger haunts, and the Chuck Box is a favorite of mine, especially since it was one of the first, well, dives I ever went to for a burger.  I finally got a chance to go back there after several years' absence.\n\nI'm sure that when it was built (which I don't know when that was, the Box was a veteran burger joint when our family moved to Arizona in the early 80s), it was on the north side of Arizona State University, but as ASU has grown, it's probably more accurate to say that it's now kind of in the middle of ASU.\n\nIn any case, the Chuck Box is basically a burger shack, emphasis on the shack. It's old gnarled wood, and it sports a definite sloppiness in construction that's the hallmark of a \""shack\"". Actually, sometime in the 80s I remember the place had a bit of a makeover, in which they added some windows (greatly increasing the light level), added some ventilation (greatly reducing the smoke level from the grill), and removed a lot of the accumulated crap on the walls and ceiling. I think I liked it better before, but I'm not a building code enforcer, either.\n\nBut, even though the random mementos on the wall are interesting (including such oddities as a picture of Ronald McDonald signed \""Even Ronald likes to go to the Box!\""), the real features of the Chuck Box are the several foot long charcoal grill, several Frialators, and a big giant condiment bar (that says \""Have it your way... but play fair!\""). Basically, it's all about having a grilled sandwich, with the main features being the \""Big One\"" 1/3 lb burger, and the \""Great Big One\"" 1/2 lb burger. They also have a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches and the like. All the burgers are available on white or wheat buns, with several cheeses (including pepper jack), bacon, or even fried peppers.\n\nFinally, you can round out your burger with the free condiments bar. Nothing terribly elaborate here, but it's got a decent array of your basic burger toppings (onions, pickles, pickled jalapenos, mustard, etc).\n\nPros:\n\n1. This is a seriously good charbroiled burger done right. I opted for my normal, a Big One with swiss and grilled peppers, with a bunch of onions, mustard, and jalapeno piled on.\n\n2. Free well-stocked condiment bars should be the norm at any burger joint...\n\n3. The fries (a.k.a. Chuckbox Potatoes) are quite good here, with a nice crunchy exterior and a mashed-potato-like interior. Seriously, I like the fries here.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Being in the middle of ASU, parking can be an issue, and on occasion, it's pretty crowded.\n\n2. If it's not sunny out, this place can be danker than Moe's Tavern.\n\nAll-in-all, I was glad to see that one of my favorite burgers for over 20 years is still a solidly dependable burger.",692,3

"The one star is for the staff. They are cute and sweet and very on top of it. However, this is simply the most appalling food that any restaurant has ever tried to serve me. It made Denny's seem like a visit to Fouchon. It is so nightmarishly over priced and so under developed. The omelet I had was filled to bursting point with a clear greasy liquid. My friends had sandwiches where the bread was just soaked in the same curious matter, and the chicken had the consistency of asbestos. And for this, an omelette was 11 bucks, and a sandwich is 13. The southwest scramble was filled with super cheap greasy chorizo and tasted like scrambled eggs with a canned sloppy joe mix thrown in, vegetables were frozen, of course. Shocking. This really is a new very dark development for Las Vegas. It used to be that you could arrive here and get a decent meal and a room for cheap so you could spend all your money on gambling. Now, everywhere you turn, you are being nickel and dimed and overcharged to such an embarrassing level that you simply want to go home and just spend your money doing something really fulfilling there. Planet Hollywood is so douchey that you may actually feel in danger crossing through the casino, it looks like a bunch of wife beaters hunting for their next victims.

"Nothing like a humongous margarita to add to the heartburn that has already been raging off mass amounts of pizza, booze and sleep deprivation.  SO WORTH IT.\n\nMargaritaville is the shizniz.

But alas, a few gulps later, we walked into a lively atmosphere with sticky floors and fantastic music.  Almost like a nightclub, but free and with much less douchebaggery, Margaritaville is a fantastic place to spend an hour or so, before hitting up the next spot on the strip.  The margaritas are super tasty, and expensive to boot.  But it's Vegas, so if you don't expect it it's your own damn fault.\n\nGo for the margaritas.  Go for the music.  Go for JIMMY.",206,3
I love it here. This was what I had to look forward to every summer as a child. It had a little bit for every age group. It had 4 or 5 old wooden roller coaster that I love. Also it has really great food for an amusement park. Would recommend to anyone at any age.,65,4

We ordered home delivery and it took a bit longer than we expected (about 45 minutes). But the food totally solved my craving for Indian for a while. The chicken tikka masala tasted different and sweeter from what I had before but I enjoyed it. The chicken Jhal Frazi was perfect for the spicy tongues. And the Bhonna lamb was just excellent. I would definitely order from them again.,83,3

Nothing?\nMe:  Was I not clear?\n\nHim:  Are you aware that even if someone hits you in our car, and our car is not rentable you are liable for that money while it's being repaired and your insurance won't cover it?\nMe:  I don't want the insurance.\n\nHim:  Who is your insurance company at home?\nMe:  Give me my !@#$^& car!\n\nHe hands me my envelope and in big black permanent ink and capital letters \""CAR INSURANCE REFUSED\""\n\nI felt like I was being completely harassed.  I go downstairs and apparently my car was so dirty, it had to be washed twice immediately before I could enter the vehicle.  Standing in the parking lot for 10 minutes with my wife and 2 kids.  This only added to the frustration.\n\nI will gladly be paying the extra 20-50 to any other rental car company. I will never use Dollar again.  \n\nWriting this review has only rekindled the frustration, and I will be complaining to their corporate headquarters as well.  The lack of service was unbelievable.",569,0
"We were able to get day-of reservations for a Friday night at 8:30pm.  The restaurant was small, tastefully decorated and brighter than your average evening fine dining restaurant.\n\nWe got:\n-two glasses of Cabernet- great wine \n-fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes.  Delicious with a little coarse salt and balsamic\n-chopped salad with a little cheese, salami and a very tasty vinaigrette.  Even though I am not much of a salad person, it was great and tasted very fresh\n-salad with balsamic dressing - wasn't as good as the chopped salad, but still quite good\n-half order of fresh pasta with Parmesan, zucchini and tomatoes -the perfect size for a lighter meal- I ate all of it.  I worried the pasta would be too heavy for a late dinner, but it was perfect in the smaller portion\n-skirt steak- this was my boyfriend's third dish with balsamic.  Perhaps by that time he had had enough balsamic, but it wasn't stellar.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous\n-tiramisu- tasty!\n-French press coffee and cappuccino- very good as well, fresh \n\nOverall, it was an excellent meal and the smaller portions allowed us to try many different things on the menu.  Without a doubt, we will be back as the menu changes seasonally/weekly.  The menu was smaller so you could tell how the chefs spent time curating each dish and picking items in season.",318,4
"Best sandwiches hands down! I was a little skeptical about what to order. My friend told me that the holiday turkey is really good but I'm not a big fan of turkey. It turned out delicious!! It was a interesting combination, a little sweet and a little salty. We also got a club sandwich, a salad, the chili and the loaded potato soup. Both the chili and loaded potato soup was bomb!! I heard really good things about the cheddar broccoli soup, so I'm definitely going to have to go back and try it before I leave! The club sandwich was just okay, but pretty full sandwich. Lots of bacon and avocado.\nAlthough the line can be long, it moves really quickly and the food comes relatively quickly as well. There was nothing special about the salad, my friend was just trying to be healthy. \n\nIf you are in town, you must try this place!!",186,4
Just had dinner at RM Seafood.  The Surf and Surf was good - lobster on truffle risotto and shrimp on mushroom duxelle. I had the Crab Duo - the jumbo lump crab cake was outstanding and it was served with three king crab legs which were fresh.  Good service and nice atmosphere.  Wouldn't rave about this place but for fresh seafood in Las Vegas it is very good.,81,2
"I have eaten here a few times in the past month and really like it. My favorite dish is the slices of tri tip roast. I always ask for it as rare as possible and pretty consistently get what in a steak house would be called medium rare which is what I like. The reason for the five star rating is that I can get a generous \""red meat\"" meal that is blood red at far less than you would pay at a steak house. The sides, such as mashed potatoes, potato pancakes, or grilled vegetables are also good. The dinner dish also comes with soup and their clam chowder is excellent. On a couple of occasions dining companions have raved about the chicken pot pie. In summary, generous portions of good food at good prices. You can also join their dining club which costs $25 but then gets you two $25 credits and lets you earn a 10% credit on all your meals.",189,4
"Ok, if you can remember the game \""Mouse Trap\""...that's what you will be, stuck in here. Very easy to get lost in this hotel. It reminds me of the days when I went to TJ Mexico and the night club was on the top floor, you had to go through a maze to get to the club. The same problem here, nothing is labeled correctly and you will be running in circles trying to get to your room, parking and casino.\n\nThis place kind of reminds me of circus circus casino as well, except without all the kids. Very dirty and old decor, many areas reek of urine and the rooms aren't that clean or well maintained. Not the best hotel experience, have hand sanitizer on hand.\n\nPROS: Hosts are friendly, Casino is okay, Hash House, O'sheas Casino, great new years party with lobster and filet minion, live music and penthouse fireworks display.\n\nCONS: YOU WILL get lost in here, very dirty, smells, poor maid service, in room coffee makers are very dirty, rooms not cleaned well, elevators take forever...just to name a few.",238,1

"Visited this location for the first time as I was heading to the nearby DMV and just knew I would need to be well fueled for that experience.

What I mean by that is, it's a BBQ place obviously but, it's clearly a chain version of the genre.\n\nNothing at this Shane's or any other location is inherently bad when taken on it's own merits, you just can't start comparing your meal to real BBQ from some local place.  Example.  The pork on my sandwich was plentiful, not fatty and fairly moist.  But, if I'm looking for any bark or trying to taste any smoke flavor I will be left wanting.\n\nWhile I did not try them this visit, I do think Shane's does a better job on ribs than anything else so would assume that holds true at this location.

There was nothing worth eating. How can you make a curry that tastes like NOTHING? I mean, really?\n\nAlso, they definitely overcharge for this buffet. Is it because this is Vegas?

"Ok, so they have chocolate covered bacon. I have to be the only person who thinks bacon is overrated, but I still couldn't resist just buying a piece to try. I'm such a bandwagoner! I didn't enjoy the bacon in the least, but at least I tried. \n\nThe bakery has a $5 for $10 Yelp deal available, which is a pretty good deal. Aside from the bacon, I bought two cookies on a stick. The first was a chocolate chip cookie filled with an oreo and cheesecake, the other was chocolate with a  mounds bar inside. Both were amazingly tasty. I'm not usually a big fan of overly sweet treats with too many flavors all mixed together, but these were so good. \n\nDefinitely something to eat regularly, but honestly they are worth a try.",175,3
"In a city (especially the Strip) loaded with overpriced, overcooked and unremarkable food - the Burger Bar is a fabulous find.\n\nMy husband had the veggie burger with guacamole (and we're guac snobs) and it was delicious.  My salmon burger was perfectly cooked and complimented by their veal-shallot reduction sauce.  You basically build your own burger.  There's alot to choose from, so you may as well utilize the helpful staff so you can have a good experience.  (Asking restaurant staff's opinion is an underrated activity.  It also explains the grumpy reviews on this page.)\n\nWith good staff (who rave about the owner/chef, Hubert Keller) and options plentiful, if you don't find something you like at a price that works for you - it's your own fault.\n\nEat here now!",186,4
"When to this place with very high expectations. After a successful Vegas trip for my friends birthday, what more to end the trip with a good place to eat before a long drive back to San Diego. The whole trip, there was a huge hype for Aloha kitchen being the Bomb.com and all that... I was amazed how my first and last  experience was the worst service I EVER had at any place I have eaten at (literally). \n\nMy friends and I get there, and it did not seems busy at all. Just about a 1/3 of the restaurant was full. We were impressed with the menu items and we were excited to place our order. We sit down... wait... wait... wait.... and wait... then waited some more... 30 mins pass. With no acknowledgement of the staff that we have been waiting for so long and still no food. Then we see the another group of people who already ordered and sat down, get up and complained about the wait. Then they were told that their food has not even started cooking... I felt bad for them, as I am sure that they were waiting over an hour and nothing. Then the started to ask for a refund... then finally their food came out..\n\nI was thinking, if their food is starting to come out... then our food should come out soon after a 45 mins of waiting. One of my friends went to go check on our food, and one of the ladies, stated that they just started cooking it. WTF really? 10-15 mins later.. our food started to come out and they were serving us the food that we did not even order. We tried to nice about it but the service was horrible. After straightening about ordered what.. Then find out that one of my friends and MY order has not even started cooking... WOW WTF!!!?!?!?!!??!! we waited... over an hour and nothing... WOW pathetic... I then complained to what is going on... why is everything taking so long and they made the excuse that there was no cooks or the cook who was suppose to be an hour earlier when we ordered, just came in.. \n\nThank you for the courtesy of letting us know ahead of time so we could have at least thought about eating here... Thank you for not compensating anything for the time we have wasted waiting for our food and to find out that it was not even put in to be cooked. I simply asked if they can compensate us for a simple drink for the long wait.. and we got denied like it was our fault. ARE YOU FREAKEN KIDDING ME!?!? Asked for a refund, and it was a hassle for even getting my money back.\n\nFinally... there was some acknowledge from the staff that there was something actually going on... that they were backed up yadda yadda... that would have been greatly appreciated hmmmm.... an hour ago when we first placed our order.\n\nHonestly, I am not a negative person. I am really patient and I can understand that we are human and we all make mistakes, but I was not going to put up for any BS as that is all I got at ALOHA KITCHEN. \n\nNEVER AGAIN GOING TO THIS PLACE AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO EAT HERE.  \n\nTIP FOR MANAGEMENT: CONSIDER NEW STAFF \n\nThis is not a review, this is a hate letter to this place for the time and you have taken away from my life.",716,0

"This used to be my favorite place to go in Vegas. In fact, I would have rated it 5 stars just a year ago. However, the quality of the food has really gone downhill since then. \n\nI was here just a week ago, excited as usual to get my yummy tuna melt and holiday turkey sandwich to share with my sister. I noticed something as soon as I got the sandwiches, they were much smaller than usual. I have been to Earl's more times than I can count. I've been to both this location and the one in Downtown Disney. So I knew for sure that something was off. I just thought to myself \""That's alright I guess, I don't need to be eating so much\"". Then I noticed that the sandwiches were barely toasted, in fact, the holiday turkey was almost white in color. What the hell? I took a bite of the tuna melt first. It was decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be. There was definitely less cheese and it seemed drier than I remembered. The contents of the holiday turkey was still pretty good, but the bread just wasn't toasted enough. \n\nI'm just really sad that the quality of their product has gone down so much. I feel like whoever is higher up needs to realize that they are ruining their brand image by sacrificing the quality of their product for larger profit margins. Not sure if I really want to come back to this location unless there's a change.",311,2

I'm very grateful that this bar was not my introduction to Mediterranean food.  However, here's my disclosure, I'm a foodie, and I probably should stay away from bars when dining out, so I take some responsibility for my disappointment.   However, the next time I want what tastes like previously frozen food from Giant Eagle's freezer, I think I'll just go to Giant Eagle.  When it comes to the food, buyer beware.",163,0

When we ordered our meals, the orders weren't right. When we told the waiter that we had the wrong steak, he came back and told us that they would give a five dollar credit.

They looked like they were pretty satisfied. \n\nBeverages: We ordered a bottle of pinot noir and that was pretty good. \n\nOverall it was a great restaurant and priced pretty decent. We had a $ 75 coupon that we got fom restaurant.com so we got that taken off our bill. Total price for the four of us was 230 including tip.

"Wanted to try this place out because of all the good reviews on Yelp and was disappointed. Bad sign when it only had white folk eating there and we were the only asians to be seen.  Aside from that, there were a number of reasons for the disappointment:\n\n1) First off, when you go to a vegas ayce sushi joint you expect mediocre quality fish because of the sheer volume these places put out as well as the fact that you're in the middle of the desert.  That being said, the quality of the fish at 808 Sushi and both Sushi Mon locations are better imo.  \n\n2) Rice. It was over cooked & gummy, and they put way too much rice on their nigiri!  Good sushi has a nice slice of fish covering a small dollop of sushi rice, but not here.  Each piece had a lot of overcooked rice underneath. Bleh.\n\n3) Selection wasn't very good for the side dishes.  Most of these ayce sushi restaurants have their special side dishes in addition to the sushi to give your tastebuds a rest from all the sushi you consume.  Tried the teri salmon (meh), pork katsu (thin and dry), shrimp tempura (okay), soft shell crab (too much batter), and oyster shooters (pretty good).  Other places offer hamachi kama, kal bi, miso cod (butterfish) just to name a few things--not here. Sides were weak sauce here.\n\n4) I've read about how you \""MUST HAVE\"" the vampire roll, baby octopus, and fried banana for dessert, and all were painfully mediocre.  First two I had at the beginning of the meal while I was still hungry, and both were a struggle to finish.  Maybe I'm spoiled from living in Hawaii, but think of somewhere that has tako poke that is \""just alright\"", and it probably tastes better than this baby octopus app.  Fried banana was pitiful--after one bite i opted to finish the green tea ice cream that came with it instead (Maeda-en, which isnt that great to begin with).\n\nMaybe all of the 5 star ratings got my hopes up a little, but that doesn't change the fact that this place is below avg when it comes to Vegas ayce sushi.  Service was alright, nothing terribly wrong happened, just had a below-avg dining experience here due to the food.  Seriously--808 Sushi, Sushi Mon (both locations), Oyshi Sushi, Hikari are all better than this place.  Hell, if I was in that part of town jonesing for some ayce sushi I'd just walk across the street to Island Sushi!!  Will not go back.",573,0

"I've had a lot of sushi from a lot of places, as many others have. The difference between me and some of those people is that I've had the pleasure of visiting Sakana. In fact, after my first visit I was hooked, and have had the pleasure of visiting countless times. \n\nI'll keep it very simple and provide you the order to end all orders. Why is Sakana better than any other affordable sushi option? Quantity, quality, price...amazing service is the cherry on top. Instead of being subjective I'll focus on a more objective view. Here's what I order EVERY time with my girlfriend:\n\nDrinks $14: Large Kirin and sake x2 \nAppetizers $2 ($1 each with Kirin purchase!):\n\nJalaccini (fried zucchini and jalapeno)\nFried mushrooms (best you'll ever have)\nBoth come with \""miso mayo\"" the greatest sauce I've ever tasted!\n\nSushi $7.65:\n\nSpicy tuna roll (the biggest roll you will find, bar none. I kid you. not, these things are stuffed full of tuna)\n\nMexican Caliente roll (jalapeno goodness, just as gigantic as the spicy tuna!)\n\nGrand total for 2 sake bombs, 2 apps, and 2 giant rolls:\n \n$23.65 + $5 tip\n\nThis is the best of the best, and for a price that can't be beat. Oh and here's a bonus: they have gluten free soy sauce! \n\nOther tips: ask for the happy hour cocktail menu, they don't have it out, but most of the drinks are incredible and affordable.",375,4

"Went for lunch....I moved here about 6 months ago and this was my first attempt to find a Pho joint. I had my favorite back east ( Pho So 1 Richmond, VA). Very friendly greeting and a corner booth was mine. Its a small place with about 7 booths and 5 or so tables.\nIt was clean and inviting with large flat screen TVs.\nI ordered the veggie spring rolls because im trying to eat better...they were good, probably because of the peanut sauce & sriracha. My meal was of course Pho....I couldn't decide between the chicken or veggie so they combo'd for me. The bowl was packed with noodles and veggies almost to a fault. I could even add the side toppers. The broth was hot and tasty but I like to sweat so I dosed it with sriracha and chili sauce like im used to doing. After one spring roll I could only eat half of my soup. They cheerfully provided to go containers. Making the soup a combo added $3 to what would have been a reasonable $6.95. You upsize to large for $1 or XL for $2. Not sure that would necessary as my regular was enough for two. All in all I'd go back if in the area but will also keep trying other places.",268,2
"I TOO HAD A EASY BAKE OVEN!! Can I open a restaurant too?! Funny how it tastes so similar! While strangely nostalgic, I've long since outgrown rubbery, tasteless pizza. Though customers have the ability to draw on the walls and young children are playing with the food behind the counter, this is sadly not chucky cheese. Sorry Zzeek's but I'd rather visit my cousins playroom for more packaged tasting food. At least she knows customer service.\n\nHonestly though, I was not at all impressed with this restaurant. The pizza looked nothing like the picture. The crust was hard and frozen tasting, while the shriveled and sparse toppings slid right off the greasy elastic-like cheese.  \n\nThe blonde child behind the counter was a bit rude and talked loudly about me and my brother in front of us. It took us forever to get any sort service! I know family comes first, but it's a bit ridiculous when I'm waiting to pay, and everyone is in the back chatting and laughing it up. It's a bit sad when McDonalds has you beat at service. A, \""Hello welcome to Chucky Ch- I mean Zzeeks family own pizza factory\"" would have been nice! \n\nI could go on and on about the service, the children working behind the counter, the overpriced food, the lack of pizza boxes that don't fall apart, and much much more. \n\nIf you want to find out for yourself what a horrid place this is, be my guest! It's an entertaining place to be :)",335,0
Great experience! Service was excellent and we sat at the bar. Had the Jalape\u00f1o popper burger my date had the Dynamic Duo and we shared the King roll. Sushi roll was good size. Very tasty. We couldn't finish our burgers. Can't  wait to come back everything looked and sounded good.,73,3
"Along with my husband and 3 other friends, we went to the Orange Sky for drinks.  I had dressed up very nicely for the occasion including my Ellen Tracy top, black pants and nice jewelry.  I also wore patent leather thong sandals.  Upon entering the ground floor by the elevators to the Orange Sky, I was told by the maitre d that I could not go up because I was wearing flip flops.  Meanwhile, others in tennis shoes and baggy jeans were allowed.  My friend said she had some old walking shoes in the car and we should get those.  So, I went out to the car and got the dirty old walking shoes and proceeded to put them on and head back.  No problem - admitted.  Now we get to the top and I see other women in silver thong sandals, beige thong sandals, etc.  \n\nWe had drinks and a couple of apps (salmon cakes and the chili beef tips).  They didn't have much of a selection of apps and really no imported beer.  The apps we did get were expensive and nothing very special.\n\nThe sunset, however, was spectacular in spite of the dirty windows but to be fair, there had been a dust storm the day before.  \n\nOn the way down, I stopped by the maitre d again and told him I saw other women in thong sandals and he said that was not true and that he would not let anyone in with \""flip flops\"".  I'm not sure if this guy had something against me or what but he certainly seemed to have missed the entire concept of the purpose of a dress code. \n\nI would not go back here in spite of the lovely sunset.",356,0

Reason being is, the place cultivates trend, and epitomizes liberality from the AZ Scottsdale gilded cake faces and shiny car Dbags. \n\nA centralized focus on passive cult trends and proactive enthusiasm for the antipodes.\n\nI see the NW, where the happiest excitement in life is to be convinced that one is fighting for all one is worth on behalf of some clearly seen and deeply felt good, and against some greatly scorned evil.\n \nWelcome to AZ.\n\nR\\_\n\nNOte, Trying to cover the overhead?

Great theater usually really clean .. I'm not sure if the staffing changed since RAVE was in charge but it seems like the management is better but still for some reason the last 3x I went they were late to start the movie and/or they didn't turn on the wide screen until the movie already started ( like 5 min into it ) ?? Wish they Would stay on top of that,83,3
"I had their sandwiches THREE times (as silly as it sounds) during my last weekend Vegas trip. It's that good. I have tried the Mediterranean Chicken Wrap, the Earl's Club, and All American. And I must say the Earl's Club is the best comforting food. Their artisan bread is excellent, and the portion size is reasonable.\n\nIf you're seeking a cheap hearty midnight snack that is going to satisfy your hunger, this is the place to go because it's open 24 hours. And it's convenient to find because it's right off the strip in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood.",134,3
"I wrote a review of this vegetarian and glute-free friendly restaurant a few months ago.  In the intervening months, I have sampled more (i.e., most) of the menu and it has become, hands down, my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona, knocking out some serious competition.\n\nI eat at Gallo Blanco 2-3 times a week.  If I lived in the neighborhood, it would be even more often.  The food is fresh, hot and tasty.  The staff is wonderful. Whether I am trading jokes with Melissa or talking business with Susan, everyone is always happy and goes out of their way to make the experience fun and comfortable.\n\nI have made it my personal mission to get the word out about this place (and to get one in the Ahwatukee area).  Every one of the over twenty people I have taken to Gallo Blanco has been enthusiastic about returning.  What higher praise is there than that.",200,4
"We had been waiting and wondering just how the dining experience was here. We went in on a Wednesday at 4:15 PM......and even though there were MANY empty tables we were told our wait would be 10 minutes. Our wait time turned into an hour...not 10 minutes I ordered sirloin steak and my wife ordered a baked potato, along with French onion soup. My choice came with a side salad and I optioned for the French onion soup also.\n     Our orders arrived in decent time....but my wife's baked potato was cold, although her soup was very hot. My soup was hot as well....but my salad was very mediocre at best. My piece of steak looked good when it arrived.....but wreaked of salt upon tasting! I could not even finish the meat because of the taste. To top things off......the bill came to just shy of $40......and we had no alcoholic drinks....just ice tea and Coke. No desserts either!\n     Needless to say, we won't be going back.....and I don't really think this restaurant will be around long, because there are too many GOOD places to eat in Surprise....and all very easy to get to!",252,0
"They have a meatless section! Although there's a sign on the board, there really isn't a lot of selection for vegetarian alternatives in the frozen section. Was a little underwhelmed when I saw the sign -- I thought maybe I had found a little frozen vegetarian paradise. Turns out that's not the case.",67,2
"After spending a week in Vegas on the strip, a few of us wanted to unwind with a more flavoured meal in quieter surroundings. We could not have picked a better place - the decor is fine, and it is a very relaxing environment - a far cry from the hustle and bustle of the strip. \n\nWe started with popadoms and samosa chat. For the mains we had goat biryani, makhni daal, karahi chicken and garlic naan. It was all very well prepared and presented. The 'hot' dishes were a bit mild for my taste, but after a week of eating at the hotels, it really was a joyous dinner. \n\nThe service was absolutely top notch and waiters made sure we were looked after without being over-imposing. \n\nAll in all a great place to go and eat when in Vegas if you're looking for great food and the opportunity to unwind.",193,3

About to walk out because of no one at Cliniqe counter and loud women working at Estee Laudet counter talking about how tired they are and not calling anyone over to help! How can there be no one at the counter for 20+ minutes during bonus time!!! The crowd was getting rowdy but I was first in line so I ended up staying.  Someone finally came over to help and said that the person at the counter was at lunch.  Not good.,98,1
"This review is based on lunch we had here.\nBefore heading out to the pool, we wanted to grab a quick bite. An employee suggested we could eat here.\nEverything you can order is laid out on display behind the glass.\nSome of us ordered salads. When we asked for more dressing, they said salad comes pre-made so they couldn't provide it for us. Uhhh.... What????\nSome of us ordered the croissant/panini sandwiches, they were ok at best; the bread kinda cuts up the the inside of ur mouth.\nThe service was horrible. You wait in line and you order, and you pick up ur order when it's ready. But the workers were so indifferent that I thought I was at the DMV for a moment. It took forever to get their attention when I asked for the coffee & water that they forgot to provide. One of the workers literally glanced at us a couple times & just looked away when we called for her attention.\nNow that I'm on here I realize that this place is more known for their desserts, and they did look yummy. Maybe I'll come here & deal with the bad service to try out their dessert stuff next time.",250,1
"Let me first start out by saying our server Erika, was awesome! Excellent, excellent service from this gal. Anyway, I came here once again on the 2nd with my guy. We were seated immediately by a nice hostess without having to wait. Not too long after we sat down, we were greeted by Erika! She was so friendly, fast, and attentive..even with the place being quite busy. My guy got the jumbo shrimp with Indonesian rice and spinach and I got the fish of the day which was the tombo, served with white rice, broccoli, pesto, mango chutney, and another sauce which I don't remember...sorry! \nMoving on, the shrimp dish was excellent! The rice had a lot of flavors and the sauce they had for the shrimp was a wee spicy..yum! The fish on the other hand, was over done and came out a little dry. So we informed Erika, and bam! No problem! She was so sincere and I actually felt bad that I had to send it back, but the guy insisted. They actually gave me a new plate with the perfectly done fish and once again, Erika was there to make sure everything was right! She also made sure our glasses of water never went empty!\nWe finished off the meal with a chocolate souffle and as usual, it was deelish! The whole meal cost us 69 bucks and we made sure we left our server with more than 20 percent! \n\nGreat food, excellent service, equals a great night at Yardhouse!",316,4
"I had four different companies out to troubleshoot an AC unit that was not cooling.  Only Donley was able to fix the problem. Since then, I have used them a few times for other issues and the techs are always super nice, communicate effectively and they seem competitively priced.  I am a very loyal customer.  Their manager, Fred, is the best in town - I am convinced.",81,4
"I really want to love this place. Like someone else said, I have a love/hate relationship with this market. You will not find better prices, but you get what you pay for. The Mesa location is ALWAYS a zoo. I just got back from the AJ location (a little off the beaten path but way less crowded) and I got 3 packets of strawberries for $1. My son eats strawberries everyday, I couldn't pass it up! \n\nWe get the strawberries home and maybe got a bowl full out of the 3 packets. They were all moldy or about to turn. I'm so disappointed as I love to shop local. I also live in Phoenix, so what it costs in gas to get out there, isn't worth the product I get. We did luck out with some lemons, peaches, watermelon, and carrots. But, its just not worth 2 hours out of my day to make the drive. I'll pay more and shop at Sprouts instead.",209,1
"I've been to Thomas Street only to drink and hang out-once in the spring and again this past weekend.  I love the firepits and benches with heaters in the back patio.  I also think they have a great bar staff who knows how to handle a busy bar crowd and can get you with a drink in your hand quickly and efficiently.  I was a bit miffed when walking inside this past weekend based on my earlier experience at The Peculiar Rabbit (eyes rolling).....but the vibe at Thomas Street was good enough to put me back in a good mood.  Loved the foosball, too.",129,3
"Well, by most off-the street burger places, even those who tend to be as pretentious as this place, this effort falls flat - but the experiences did have potential.\n\nOne night with a client I had the Really Good Burger cooked MED with an order of fries. I mentioned to the waitress the birger was overcooked and that the fries were limp and cold, she brought me another burger - bloody rare, not MED -.  I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chips after seeing the fries. The replacement chips were way overseasoned. They were so salty they burned my taste buds. If it were not for the draft Stella...\n\nTwo nights later I was on the receiving end of a dinner out by one of my vendors. They wanted to go to B&B. Being a gracious guest, I kept quiet thinking I could just find something else to order than a burger or a fried potato side.\n\nI ordered Crispy Cod sandwich and a lettuce wedge. The fish was greasey but it was hot, another 30 seconds of draining in the basket would have made it much better than bleeding the oil on the bottom of the sandwiches tarter sauce covered base. Again, it was OK, but for the price I would of expected something ... more. \n\nIf everything was executed and served correctly, I could easily give B@B Burger and Beer 3 to 3.5 stars. However, after two attempts in a week I'm crossing this place off of my list of Vegas places to eat, at any price.",321,1
"What a real sh*t hole. I read some reviews before going here and thought this place couldn't be as bad as people were saying for $100 room. Well I was wrong, every complaint was completely legitimate. We arrived at 9pm, got lost in the maze around the parking garage. Finally found the front desk and waited about 45 min to check in. While we were waiting in line an older gentleman fell and broke his ankle. No staff came to help this man off the floor, guests in line did. Security seemed to take their time getting there only to yell, thats right YELL, at one of the people that was holding this guys chair so it didn't slide out from under him. Everybody in line was horrified at what we were witnessing. The manager was even standing nearby chit chatting with his boss while this was all going down and yet no one felt it was appropriate to step in and help this man. They felt it appropriate for their guests to take care of it for them.   Even after we complained to the manager that we couldn't believe that he sat there and did nothing we were told that he felt they handled the situation fine and then had the balls to say \""so your chief complaint is that I was sitting there laughing\"".  Yes d-bag my chief complaint is that you were too busy chatting and laughing with your boss being only 5 feet away from the situation watching your guests take care of a 6-70 year old who is in shock and falling down in your damn hotel. \n\nWe finally got into the room (that was in the \""VIP\"" tower) and noticed the musty moldy smell coming from the bathroom right away. There was wallpaper falling off the walls, random peoples hair left all over the bathroom, seriously stained carpets, old elevators that at times seemed that the doors would not close on their own, honestly the list just goes on and on.\n\n\nAll and all a pretty terrible experience. I agree with the person who said they would have been better off at the motel 6.",431,0
"For a Michelin rated restaurant It didn't meet my expectation.  I guess I don't know what expensive food should taste like.  We did the 5 course tasting and a couple of appetizers because we knew the five course meal wasn't going to be enough food.  And No,  we are not big people and not overweight.  Actually my wife and I are HOT!  : ).  The waiter warned us that it will be too much food but we didn't believe him.  He was right! \n \nThe tuna tartare was bland and the lobster pot pie was decent.    \nMy favorite two dishes were the Foie Gras and the desserts.  The foie gras melted in my mouth and all the desserts were excellent.  We were so stuffed that we had to be rolled out of  there. Bill came to $350.....OUCH!  Luckily I won 1g at the poker table that day. whew! \n\nFood: 3 stars\nService: 4 stars  \nAtmosphere: 3.5 stars",228,2

"Fast service.... That's the only positive... I came early around 8 pm Saturday morning... Asked if they have the artisan bacon sandwich, didn't, no big deal... So i got a caramel machiatto and a chai tea latte...and a chocolate donut and cheese danish, asked the danish to be heated up.... NOW GET THIS: they said they didn't have a microwave to heat up the pastries... Ok I'm done, overpriced coffee shop that didn't even have a microwave to heat up a danish is ridiculous... And this place is in the Mandalay bay AT the strip!",125,1
Completely rude!! I don't know if the guy that helped was just having a bad day or what. Never had I received that kind of service at any pho place. Will definitely NEVER go back!!! Didn't even mind paying for an appetizer I didn't even eat. \nSomeone needs to learn how to conduct business. They surely have lost about 25 customers I normally take them... \n\nHad to give them one star just because I had to write a review.  Sadly they are just around  the corner from my house. But thankfully there's a couple more within 2 miles from me.,130,0
"While visiting Phoenix for a long weekend, we ate here two days in a row. The first day started out very well with a lunch of the Kosmic Karma pizza - with the addition of sausage. Very good late night leftovers that night, as well! The next day, before our flight left, we stopped here for a quick lunch/dinner since we thought the food the day before was decent. My friend got the steak and cheese hoagie - while she proceeded to eat it - she found a hair! We pointed this out to the bartender (as we sat at the bar) and she just threw it away and brought us our bill. She never informed the cook or manager. She also did not take off the price of my friend's meal. In a restaurant setting - this is inappropriate! Will not return on my next visit to Phoenix...",172,0
When I first arrived in Charlotte the first order of business was where do I need to eat before going home and this was top on the list ( grilled cheese food truck is #2). We drive up to this hole in the wall style place with a wing of outdoor seating that was packed with people. We go inside and are met by our server who was very friendly. We ordered our queso appetizer as I begin to scour the menu for goodies. Settling on the enchiladas was an excellent choice! Overall lovely experience for a quick and reasonably priced meal. If ever in the area craving authentic style Mexican foods stop in and carb up!!,129,3
"The cupcakes are actually good. They have a decent variety. The problem is that it cost almost $4.00 per cupcake and the size is not worth the money. Hals a dozen will cost you about $20. The birthday cake, red velvet and chocolate are good. The only reason I went it's because I bought a Groupon for so it made the price tolerable. \n\nAgain, good cupcakes but a little pricy.",94,2
"I highly recommend this practice! The dentist, hygienist, and office staff are very thorough, attentive, and proficient. I was very impressed that everyone was so friendly, that the hygienist was so thorough, and especially that the dentist (Stephanie) actually took time to have a real conversation before my exam. Unlike my experience at other dentists, my appointment didn't feel rushed, which was refreshing and welcome. Everyone from the front desk to the billing department is terrific. It's obviously a well run and pleasant office environment because everyone seems happy to be there. The office is very clean, and welcoming, and the exam rooms appear to be state of the art. I had my teeth cleaned, X-rays taken, and they even squeezed me in for a filling the very next day!",161,4

"New to vegas....wanted some BBQ ribs...i searched and searched....seems like bbq is something hard to come by out here in the dessert.    Finally I found some good reviews for TC Ribs.   So I drove out there for a to go order.\n\nTook my order of full slab baby back ribs and mac and cheese and baked beans.   The sides were good, the baby back ribs were a bit disappointing for my taste.  There was a lot of fat on the ribs and they really didnt melt off the bones.",110,2
"What a delightful treat! My friend and I popped in for a very short breakfast before a beauty appointment in that area. I'm *still* kicking myself we ran short on time!  \n\nWe were greeted warmly by the bartender and asked to seat ourselves anywhere. Oof! Was this difficult! So many appealing choices to pick from. Ultimately we settled ourselves on these super comfortable couches. After explaining our schedule constraints to Ashlynn (who rocks it with her blue tipped hair) our food came out in short order.\n\nLest I forget, their coffee is served with a treat of sweet heavy cream. I missed the introduction as I was powdering my nose. But it is sufficiently flavored that many may not need sugar. Yum!\n\nTheir cheese board is ginormous! I love cheese and was craving something warm so we also ordered the mac & cheese WITH BACON. Yes. That exists. You should try that if you're ever in the mood for some comfort food. Be warned this is 1) not diet food 2) very filling 3) should be shared. \n\nI did not share it.\n\nGo ahead. Judge.\n\nThis place is bookmarked for me to return! I definitely would like to sample their drinky treats and lounge when I have more time. Super, super cute place! Big fan of how nice and friendly all the servers were.",296,3
"Service was good here amidst a bit of a crowd but the food came hot and fast. I unfortunately didn't care much for the flavors of the spicy pho or the amount of shellfish throughout the menu (allergies.)

"This place was probably very good at some point. So good in fact that it went to their heads and its been downhill ever since. \n\nI've eaten at some rather fantastic French restaurants in Paris, Lyon, Beaune and throughout the South of France in my life, not to mention restaurants in many of the other great cities of the world. None of them had the arrogance in their manner of service and treatment of clients that this place had. I've seen it a few times before to a lesser degree at those pretend French restaurants (the type where the waiters speak with a French accent, but actually can't speak French -- happened to me in Beverly Hills, California) where they try to bluff their way through, and on rare occasion at restaurants that had once been great and had lost it and were left simply to trade on their former reputation. \n\nI noticed it the first time we tried to eat at Bonaparte and they sent us away because the kitchen had just closed. Its not that I don't understand the kitchen being closed and thus the inability for them to serve us, but rather it's the manner in which it was done. \n\nI noticed it the second time on the amazed face of our concierge when she tried to make a dinner reservation. She was astonished at how they treated her, the concierge of one of Old Montreal's top hotels. \n\nAnd we experienced it in such full force when we arrived for dinner that we had to leave, never having ordered. It was just such an unwelcoming dismissive arrogance that comes from the restaurant staff thinking the customer is not a customer but a mark who should count himself lucky to be in their presence, totally forgetting that actually they are there to welcome, serve, and make us, the customer, feel special. \n\nThe crowning moment was when the waitress told us how we should not speak French because if we did she would then answer in French and we of course could not understand French. Quelle surprise, given that my family is French and I speak fluent French having lived and gone to school in France, and my wife speaks more than passable French. It just blew us away and was the final straw that popped the bubble of high hopes for dinner at Bonaparte. \n\nThe sad truth is the motto of this restaurant has become \""Bonaparte, where the customer is always wrong.\""",492,0
"Love coming past this shop to see what kind of new styles of shoes and accessories are in stock! \n\nWhen I was given birthday money last year this was one of my first shops where I'd gladly drop a few pennies. \n\nThe shoes here are very good quality and can provide comfort with people who have bad feet! My mom can get very sore feet, so she felt very welcome here, and walked away with a couple pairs of pretty flats! But even more so, the shoes here are very unique and come in ranges of lots of different colours. It's really a place to find a cool pair of shoes no one has! \n\nI also love the bracelet I got here last year, it looks like a belt (funky!). \n\nPlus, how pretty is William Street?! I just like being around this shop! Cobble stone street, independent stores, a very good pub.. heaven.",194,3

"I went here to get my serpentine belt replaced and a transmission flushed and these guys were friendly and efficient.  They took the time to explain things to me and I felt comfortable that they were making the appropriate recommendations without trying to charge me for things I didn't need.  It was ready in just a few hours as promised so I was able to pick it up same day.  Only complaint is that they left my transmission fluid dipstick out of place under the hood so it was just laying on top, but fortunately it didn't fall down and screw up anything since it was laying flat on the top, but if it had that could've been a more serious problem.  So I subtracted a star for that since it seemed a bit careless.",154,3
"After reading reviews, we decided to trek out this way just for a celebratory dessert outing. I've gotten sick of the frozen yogurt places so a real ice cream shop was on my mind. This place was amazing. They had like 16 flavors, all made there.  Super fun flavors, which we tried most of. The sweet girl gave us as many samples as we wanted, didnt seem at all put off. Cookie monster, grasshopper, playdough, laveen concrete, and cake mix was our flavors of choice. We didnt think it was that expensive at all, compared to other cold stone or maggie moo's. It's worth the trip. Go try it!",141,4
"Went with the Wife for our first trip ever to Gallagher's.  It has a great menu and I was totally surprised that for a Saturday night it was pretty dead.  We ordered appetizer (mushroom and zucchini) and the half rack ribs which were on special.  \n\nOur server was uumm how you say...different?  Not very friendly for someone who works with customers but we were hungry, new to the area, hungry, and wanted someone to cook for us.  It took awhile for the apps to come, he did ask if we wanted them first, and yes, they did come first.  2 min later, here comes dinner!!  Now this is a pet peeve.  I spent enough time in a kitchen to know you hold the main course order until the appetizer is done and they customer is ready for the main course.\n\nThe fried veggies were ok, I love deep fried mushrooms, and these were on the low end of good.  The dinner however was far from good.  Ribs were dry, over cooked but had good sauce,  baked potato was over done, and putting frozen butter on to a luke warm over cooked potato just does not help much.  The garlic toast was yummy, but not worth what you pay for the rib dinner.  Wife had twice baked potato and it looked like a mess.  I don't think she liked it much and her steamed veggies were awful.  $37 for some crappy food and mediocre service.  Sorry guys....wont be coming back ever.  Wow....I hate it when going out on a Saturday is such a bad experience.  Should have just grabbed some Samurai Sams and headed home to watch the ASU game.",355,1
"Well, not so good...My sister and I went for dinner before a show.  So happy to see this restaurant on Roosevelt Row...so sad to taste the food!  She had a salad that looked like it came from a bag except for a bit of tofu...tasteless, and I had the french onion soup, again tasteless.  I should have sent it back, but I so wanted the place to be good and I was hoping the entree would save them.  Not so much...we split the shrimp in alfredo sauce with whole grain noodles.  The whole thing looked brown and oozy.  By this time we were just sad for them.  The chef came over and asked about the food...we told him about the onion soup and he said yes he knew, and blamed it on his assistant.  No apology, nothing.\n\nMy suggestion about Scratch...don't go till they clean up their act.  Oh by the way, Sat. night @ 6:00 -7:30, one waiter!",217,0
"Ugh I didn't go here because of Guy Fieri either, I was actually dragged against my will... and just to let everyone know up front, my review won't be about bbq. I'll save that for an update if I ever feel like coming back here.\n\nWaitress, slow and absolutely hating life. Chili, not that great and too much of a smoky flavor for me personally. And last but certainly not least - the Mac & Cheese. It was awful...just straight from the Kraft box!  And not even made well - too watery, hardly any flavor. To the waitress's credit, she did offer me another type of Mac & Cheese but said that it would take about 30 minutes to make. I would have taken her up on the offer, but I was already hungry and not about to wait a half an hour just to be potentially disappointed again.\n\nSo if I ever come back here (big IF) then I will be happy to update my review and I'll even try some of their bbq...it would only be appropriate since this is a bbq place.",231,1

Makes it very informal and casual. \n\nI will definitely come back to this location over and over.  \n\nAll i can say is great food and very nicely decorated location.",194,3
"I don't know why they decided to put Vegas' first Golden Corral on the east side, more importantly right next to Home Depot. I guess the thought of buffet food and home improvement go well together?\n\nAnyways, this place is always crowded with family and children. I mean most buffets are pretty loud, but if you're looking to stay away from a mass amount of children then try not to go here.\n\nThe food is alright. It's your basic buffet food - nothing really sticks out. They have your salads, soup, Chinese, American, etc. I did not enjoy the pasta here. It was too bland for my liking. The only good thing I had was the steak. I asked for medium well and it came back medium well with a lot of juice to it. They have a dessert section mainly targeted at candy like M&Ms and gummy worms. They do have a chocolate fondue fountain, but I stayed clear from that because the area was a bit too messy for my liking.\n\nThe part that grossed me out the most though is the workers cleaning out the food section with the same towel. You see them cleaning the section where the sauce from the pasta spilled and next thing he's over there cleaning the Asian section with the SAME towel - smearing food across. It just doesn't seem sanitary to me.\n\nYou can try this place out just to get it off your bucket list, but don't expect much.",307,2

"Gone now (torn down - that's progress, folks). The Stardust had an OK buffet. Good seafood. I think they should at least keep the name and memory alive by putting the sign up somewhere just for the heck of it - and I'm not talking about some dusty museum thing. Oh well, I really don't give a crap. That's life and I certainly will not lose any sleep over it. Look for a new place to hang around when you're bored.... that's my belief. Hey, have you been to the Bahama Breeze yet?!!!",121,2
I would definitely recommend this service to anyone looking! After calling around and getting different estimates I called Pineapple Lawn Service. They came out the same day I called gave a quote half the price of some others and completed the job that right then. The whole process took less than 2 hours and they did an amazing job.,65,3
"I went to 5Church on October 31, 2012 at the recommendation of the bartender at Black Finn. I, and my group totaling 8 people, were excited about going. The atmosphere was eclectic,upscale, modern and vibrant. We were a large party and were seated in a separate off the main area. We were treated warmly by the person who seated us. The restaurant was not very crowded but the service was very slow. The initial wait person apologized for wait and took our initial drink order. When our assigned waitress, Alison, came she seemed a little stressed and asked if we needed more time to look over the menu. We had already been waiting quite a while and were more than ready to place our orders. We ordered cocktails from their specialty cocktail menu and they were all terrible! We tried to explain to Alison what our issue was but she seemed not to understand and wanted to charge my wife an extra shot of tequila instead of just remaking the cocktail which would have been the appropriate thing to do. Alison became argumentative with my wife which was very unprofessional. Naturally, this interaction ruined the mood for the entire evening. The drink was eventually remade to my wife's specifications but the evening was already ruined at that point. The food finally arrived and was just \""okay\"". I had the wasabi crusted salmon which had way too much wasabi crust and a small portion of salmon. My wife had smoked, roasted chicken which she enjoyed. My guest all enjoyed their meals. Overall, our evening way ruined by Alison's bad attitude. I would still give 5Church another try the next time we visit Charlotte.",338,0
"I am a native Montrealer spending some time back home, so I have been in lots of caf\u00e9s, and this is definitely NOT one that I would recommend. \nI have to say that the two waitresses were very nice, but that's the only good point about this place. \nMy husband and I went there around 2:30pm (so it was pretty quiet), and we waited at least 30 minutes before my husband got his panini, and I was told that there was an error with my order (a cr\u00eape), which would take five minutes to fix. About 25 minutes later, they finally get my cr\u00eape to me. The food in general was OK, but I was disappointed with the cr\u00eape which was burnt at the bottom. For a panini (without any kind of side), a small cr\u00eape, a coffee, a fruit salad, and a juice, they charged us over $40 CAN (i.e. $37 US). They did NOT offer us any discount for the extended delay to get the food. And finally, when I asked them to add 15% for tips to my debit transaction, they counted it OVER the total including taxes (and in Quebec, tips should normally be added to the total BEFORE taxes). Perhaps we were just not lucky, but I would never go back there, and I believe this place is still in business just because they serve mostly tourists who don't hear from other people about their poor experience there.",336,0

"Ok, so yeah good burgers but even better salads in my opinion.  I like this place and am overall a very willing participant to go here but there are a few things that I've noticed that detract from my overall what would probably be a 4 star rating.  The interiors are fine, nothing crazy but here's my biggest issue inside...the bar height.  Or maybe it's the stools.  Either way, sit at the bar and you'll know what I mean.  The stools are too short and you feel like the counter is more than nipple high!  Weird and makes for awkward posturing during your meal.  My second issue is outside.....one word....parking.  There basically is none.  Going during lunch is like a quest similar to the game Zelda.  Most times you'll find yourself parking down the street a good bit and walking back.  Not a HUGE deal and seriously it's sort of an indicator that they must be doing something right because people don't seem to mind and keep the place pretty packed as far as I can tell.\n\nI love the Asian Chicken Salad and of course the burgers (pretty much any) are fantastic.  Bottom line, don't let the parking issue get in the way and give Bad Daddy's (previously Big Daddy's) a shot!",279,2

"I went here for lunch with co-workers. The decor is pretty out dated and the blue chairs had cracking and torn vinyl and weren't very comfortable. I'm not sure why but halfway through lunch they opened the doors and left them open, flies started buzzing around our food and table.\n\nTheir food is typical Arizona Mexican food with bland flavor and no authenticity. If you are looking for a Mexican dining experience this isn't the place. We started off with guacamole, chips and salsa. The guacamole was tasteless and didn't have enough cilantro, onions or tomatoes it also didn't have any chopped serranos/jalapenos plus it needed salt. I ordered the carne asada tacos which had very dry corn tortillas, they had to be at least a few days old and left out uncovered. The meat was dry, a little chewy and lacked in flavor as well. The butter rice was good and the bean were good but lets be honest how can you mess those up.",203,1
"3 stars only because I have been disturbed all day by the staff (and its not even noon yet).  First disturbance, phone ringing (0630), I suspect it was the front desk calling leading to disturbance #2.  Approx 7am there is a knock on my door and its maintenance.  He says \""oh, they told me the room was vacant\"".  Who told you?  The front desk who has a computer containing information on which rooms are vacant and filled?  Apparently I don't exist.  I get moved to another room two floors up because maintenance needs to fix some plumbing issues that are affecting the floor below.  So I lose my comfy king bed and end up with a double.  Life goes on and I'm sitting here relaxing with my do not disturb sign on the door.  I hear a knock and think it's the maids next door.  Nope, its someone coming into my room.  I get up, pissed off, and ask her what she wants.  She's like \"" your sign is on the floor\"", so does that mean I want to be disturbed because the very flimsy do not disturb sign fell, probably while she pushed the handle down to open my door?  She then asks me when I was checking out.  Um, first off check out is at 12, its only 11.  Also, I'm not checking out until tomorrow!!! WTF Westin!  \n\nThe rooms are comfortable but some updating can occur.  The furniture is somewhat banged up and the carpet is stained.  But at least it's clean. \n\nAte breakfast at the restaurant downstairs, it was sufficient but I didn't eat $18 worth.  Service was lacking too. I asked for ketchup, and 10 min later it showed up.  \n\nThe gym is small but adequate.",396,2
"Thanks to some recommendation from native LV Yelpers, We decided to visit Hot & Juicy for dinner on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Not the best idea to come straight from the convention centre, as the Hot & Juicy smell permeated our blazers and followed us around all week, but the experience itself was well worth it. \n\nAnything that made it onto Man Vs Food is likely the opposite of what I am looking to eat, but we decided to give it a try, for the spectacle alone. As soon as we arrived, finger licking smacking, bib wearing ladies were queuing for the washroom  in need of a quick hand wash. Waitresses with big smiles and heavy eyeliner ran around with buckets and plastic gloves on their hands. I was intrigued.\n\nThe two of us sat at our plastic covered tables and ordered beer ($3 for import) 1lb of Crawfish medium Hot & Juicy special, 1 lb of shrimp medium Hot & Juicy special and 3lbs Crab Spicy lemon pepper. We also had 2 ear of corn, and an order of calamari whose accompanying fries never arrived.  It was a ridiculously too much amount fo food but we were starving after a long day on our feet.\n\nEverything arrives in a plastic bag, with sauce puddling along the bottom. The waitress dumps the bag onto your table from her bucket, and will give you a brief demo if necessary. You are instructed to dig in and leave the carcasses in the middle of your table as you plow through. \n\nRegarding the spice, I found medium wasn't enough and I regretted my decision. Also, I regretted ordering so much all at once, as we ate some got cold, which was less appetizing.\n\nFor the novelty (we barely ever see crawfish in Toronto) it was fun. Anything that dirty is always a good time of course. The flavor of the lemon pepper was really outstanding. It was great.  The service was actually among the best we got in Vegas, they were attentive and friendly.  $96 for a mammoth amount of food that could have fed 4 with about 3 beer each.  The crab was good, but I find the crawfish just doesn't give you enough meat. \n\nMinus a star for the impact on the environment from all that waste. I would have been happy with bucket, no bags.",500,3
"Fast greets both at the door and the table.  Our server Marion was quick and knowledgeable, which helped us because we were starving and wanted everything on the menu.

"A truly wonderful grocery store. The meat and deli section is worth the visit alone. They have a fantastic bakery. Not speaking French wasn't much of hurdle. All the staff was polite and friendly.

Great selection, pleasant surroundings, what more can one ask.",89,4
"I'll be the first to admit it...I rarely give a place a second chance especially when our first experience has been so poor.

The 9 course tasting menu was heaven. Simply one of the best French fusion restaurants in Montreal. \n\nSeating is limited and reservations are required but you won't be disappointed with the food or service. They have an extensive wine list as well. \n\nThis restaurant feels much more intimate than Toque since it's more dimly lit and there are several floors to the restaurant vs. a big open space. \n\nIt's definitely worth the splurge!,103,4
"The crowd here is definitely on the younger side. It looked to be filled with students, recent graduates, and young professionals. I think one of the main draws is the roof-top patio. It seems like a pleasant place for warm weather. In the winter, the patio is tented with space-heaters throughout preserving it as a cool place to hang out.\n\nThe guacamole and chips were okay. These days, everyone is a self-proclaimed guacamole connoisseur, so it's hard for restaurants to make guac which pleases every customer.",115,2

"GREAT CONCEPT; BAD EXECUTION\n\nThe idea of the Speakeasy style restaurant dining is great. The dining experience itself: not so much.\n\nI had to laugh when reading \""Steakhouse\"" on the menu because there just weren't that many steak options. Shrimp caught my eye in a few dishes, and the clams did also. We'd heard great things about the meatballs but I wanted seafood. It's an Italian place, right? Seafood and pasta sound easy enough.\n\nUnfortunately, by 6 in the evening they were out of shrimp.  Choice number 2 wasn't a bad one though. I had the \""Gallows with clams\"" in a red sauce. It was good and had a lot of clams. The sauce was tasty. Would have been good if I'd shared it over my husband's alfredo, because that was terrible. Flavorless sauce.  His meatball however was excellent. And very large; and tender! Exploding with flavor inside! I doubt we'll return here but it was fun to check out! I'd go with my clams again and he'd probably throw a meatball on top and share.  :)\n\nA salad with a red sauce preceeded dinner and was very good. (Husband disliked the sauce). A tiramisu dessert finished up the evening and it was great too!\n\nWe had a Groupon but it still wasn't an inexpensive dinner, for what it was. You're partly paying for the experience though. It was fun dining in the dark. Service has room for improvement! We first heard about the place from a fake reality show that supposedly took place there. I wish Food Network would stop airing that crap, but I'm glad we had a chance to check out one of the places it supposedly featured! \n\nIf this restaurant fails I highly suggest the owner start a meatball production factory - freeze 'em and ship out! You have a guaranteed customer in California waiting for this day!",421,1
Very disappointing experience. Ordered a SoCo Manhattan and it was served with cheap bar whiskey instead of SoCo. Bartender said they were out of SoCo so they just substituted rotgut without telling me.\n\nOur party of 4 waited a long time for our meal and then received our entr\u00e9es one person at a time with about 5 minutes in between each one. Went specifically for the Friday Fish Fry.

"3 reasons I didn't enjoy my 4 star hotel.\n\nAny shade in the desert is desirable I guess but luxury at Marriott at The Buttes was mostly a mirage.\n\nThe saving grace has been the staff, the pool, and the view. Otherwise this would just be another hotel in the desert.\n\n1: The 1970s decor and smell. I actually bought an air freshener from Walgreens for my room. It wasn't bad enough to go through the trouble of a room change and now it smells like ocean waves. :)\n\n2: The cold breakfast. Literally the bacon, sausage, and most everything else was cold on morning 1... like leftovers kinda cold. And the hash browns were to die for, literally.\n\nDay 2 I got smart and ordered a fresh made omelette. Redemption is like a tall glass of ice water.\n\n3. The fire alarm. The fire alarm actually went off while I was typing this review. False alarm thank goodness, and no evacuation.\n\nI am happy to see that it works though. Safety first!\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's no hole in the wall; lots of amenities but I don't believe it deserves 4 stars, maybe 3 if you're feeling generous.\n\nThe 2 large pools are great for an outdoor workout in the early morning or late evening. Great for family fun too!\n\nI mourn for what this location could be, a sparkling well of hope in a barren land. But mostly I mourn for what it is... old.",342,1
"A really big restaurant that you wouldn't know of until you were seated in the back. They give you the impression that they are really busy(because they seat everybody in the front) but in reality have plenty of seats in the back. \n\nQuick go through of what we got:\nFried Calamari - they made it a really Asian\""ize\"" way of Fried Calamari. In chinese restaurants, they would call this salt and pepper calamari. It tasted decent...definitely not my favorite calamari.\nMushroom fettuccine - Really like this dish. I thought the pasta was just right and the mushroom was really good. The sauce was perfect. Everything just blended well together.\nMargarita pizza - Nothing too special. Not the best pizza I've had or the worst. Crust was decent, at least it wasn't too dry. \n\nWould consider coming back...but since there are hundreds other restaurants in Vegas, probably not. \n\nService was doable.",208,2
"Nothing special here...move on.\n\nCoronado Cafe has been around for a few years and is decidedly worse now than it was last time I visited in 2009.\n\nThe menu has been \""updated\"" to include a wide variety of seafood, middle eastern and American fare.\n\nWhereas in the past there were 2 or 3 signature dishes that made Coronado Cafe Stand out, now the menu options are standard fare that is available in 50 other restaurants in Phoenix.\n\nAs for those who have said that the Coronado Cafe is romantic...I fully disagree. In the past the lighting was lower and the decor was such that one could have a romantic one on on dinner but now the lighting has been turned up full tilt and the decor has been mid westernized...with checkerboard table clothes and more tables crowded into the restaurant than before.\n\nAs a result the clientele at Coronado Cafe is now retirement age for the most part and is composed of larger groups on the Saturday night we went versus couples",215,2
"Oh Thomas Keller, I love your food. Can't you open up a Bouchon Bistro in NYC? I can't just live on the bakery alone. \n\nSo my friend, her bf, and I were in town to run in the half marathon. We were trying to locate the restaurant and of course, we got lost. We finally found it in the Venezia Tower. We made a reservation for 9PM, a late dinner, really a midnight supper for someone who had just arrived from the east coast.\n\nWe arrived slightly ahead of schedule so we were told to wait until our table opened. After a few minutes, we were promptly seated.  The menu is what you expect from a really good bistro. I wish I could afford French Laundry or Per Se but I can't.  Thank you Thomas Keller for creating a casual establishment for people like me.\n\nSince I was running 13.1 miles the next day, I decided to pass on the booze, which was a bummer.  They do have an extensive list as expected.  So the next time I'm there, I will definitely order a bottle.\n\nFor me onion soup is a staple at any French bistro.  I love onion soup!  Who doesn't like the melted cheese on top? Mmm...so good.  (And bad for you.)\n\nMy friends's bf had the chicken. You have to have chicken at a Thomas Keller restaurant. My friend got the mussels. All were great bistro dishes. I got the trout with toasted almonds. It was done perfectly. The only problem I had was that it may have been too much, which is a good problem to have. \n\nFor dessert, we had the profiteroles, chocolate mousse, and a mystery dessert the waiter had recommended. All were awesome and left us wanting for more. Okay maybe not since we were full. The mystery dessert was actually a bouchon. Great service, great food in Sin City. What more can you ask for?",424,3

The service is friendly, there's lots of dining area options, and of course the food is great and what keeps me coming back.  They have some of the best salsa/hot stuff around.\n\nThe only real negatives is that it seems like several times a year, they have a new menu where (1) they increase their prices and (2) they have a tendency to remove their best items from the updated menus.  (Here's a secret - If you order the Sampler Platter, you can ask for it \""Classic Style\"" and they'll serve it the way it once used to be with a much better selection of appetizers than the present version.)  \n\nI love this place and have supported it for years though given how their constant price increases are really getting out of control and the lack of prior dishes, the number of times I visit per year has definitely decreased and probably will continue to do so as long as these trends continue.

Horrible lash tech\nDoesn't  know what she was doing. \nDidn't have me sign a liability waiver\nWhich as a certified lash technician it is against the law to put chemicals near people's eyes without first signing a liability waiver.  \nEyes were puffy and red the next day she added for lashes to a single lash which if you've ever had your lashes done you know that's very painful.

"I had a horrible experience at the Marquee Day Club with its small pool and their fantastic ability to stuff people in like sardines.\n\nThere's nothing better than to come to a spacious pool, good looking people, and best of all: you don't even have to try to look good. \nJust grab a drink and relax in the pool, pot belly goes under water folks ;), and waddle in the water to good music. \n\nIf you come with a bad ratio of guys and girls (bad, meaning that having men in your group diminish your chances of getting in for free), I would recommend contacting a promoter about your ratio and then come very early, before noon, to avoid the $50-$60 cover charge for men.

"On Sunday my family was here visiting from California and after a day of shopping, this Wal-mart was the most convenient location for me to shop for some quick groceries. \n\nUpon walking into this Wal-mart, the unprofessionalism of the staff at this location was shocking to me, and this Wal-mart was very unmaintained.\n\nThe door greeter was hitting on some girl and they had an \""Asset Protection\"" employee going along with it.

I explained to the cashier that the purchase was being made by my father and I was not going to be involved in the consumption of the liquor but she still demanded to see everyone's IDs. I understand that stores can set their own liquor policies but the rudeness of this staff member was ridiculous. I also explained to her that their policy was faulty, and asked her why she is carding all the adults but not the children. I walked away to avoid further confrontation while my father purchased everything else.\n\nUpon exiting this Wal-mart, their \""Asset Protection\"" asked to see my receipt. Obviously this Wal-mart is run by idiots who do not understand that they cannot ask to see someone receipt without either a written statement placed in plain view explaining that they reserve the right to see receipts (Fry's Electronics), or written in the contract upon joining a club store (Costco, Sam's). \n\nThis Wal-Mart is a joke and should be avoided.",322,0
"Always the best service. Even took our store staff there as a company outing and seating took longer than promised. Manager thanked us for being patient and thanked us for coming. Then, without us saying a word asked if we liked several appetizers on the menu and said they were on the house. Always great service. Always great food. Always a customer.",71,4

"I used to go to this place all the time but the music there on the weekends now is a little much and enough to send me to one of the other many breakfast spots in Old Town. I would go there more if it weren't for the live dj and music blasting... the past few times I've been there it's been so loud my friends and I have to yell to hear each other. But this doesn't keep everyone away, there is usually a wait on the weekends. \n\nThey have bottomless mimosas and bloody marys, and an big breakfast menu. The waffles and Vanilla bean pancakes are delicious and served with fruit and apple butter.",141,2
"After a few days in Vegas, my boyfriend was dying to head to a buffet and we thought breakfast would be a good one. We read mixed reviews on so many across town and decided to just give Le Village Buffet a try. It is located in Paris, pretty easy to find near the shops. We waited in line between 10-15 minutes not due to limited seating due to the cashier and waiting to be seated.\nOnce seated, our ordered for coffee and orange juice was taken and we headed to the food. There were no lines at any station, a few people at crepes and that was it. We got in around 10:30 which was perfect as they are starting to finish up breakfast service and switch to lunch, therefore the are putting out their last fresh trays of food. From eggs benedict to pastries we had plenty off options. The bacon was decent, egss bene good, pancakes yum. Turkey bacon, chicken sausage not so hot. Hash was great but scrambled eggs too wet. Pastries tasted like they came from Costco nothing special there. Should have started with a crepe to sample what they are known for but my stomach was growling.\nFor the price $20 per person and the wait time I was pleased. Not over the moon, I mean it is a buffet but I would go again as it was an overall good experience.",281,2

"I recently joined Snap Fitness with a friend/coworker of mine. We've both been members of Las Vegas Athletic Club for a good number of years now, so it was a tough decision to join Snap. \n\nSnap is not considered a competitor of the usual suspects like 24 Hour, Golds Gym, or LVAC. They're a small chain with more modest amenities. But because of that, they are a LOT less crowded which equates to not having to wait for equipment. The gentleman who signed us up gave us a deal that actually made it as cheap as LVAC (which is arguably the cheapest in town). \n\nOne big draw for us was that Snap is conveniently located across the street from us at work. They have more locations in the Las Vegas area, though usually located on the edges of town. They have locations across the country, also, and your membership works at any of these locations. \n\nThe other big factor was that the gentleman said we can hit pads/focus mits there, as we both train in Muay Thai. Other gyms would not allow this as they're normally too crowded. \n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that the facility does not have a shower or even a changing room. They do have bathrooms and cubbies to store your belongings in, though. \n\nFor those of you who want a no-frills place to work out and not have to wait for gym equipment, I highly recommend Snap Fitness.",315,3
"Richard is the best driver ever. I don't know if he's still working there. We have not ridden the Deuce in years. We are monorail people now. We were riding it before purchasing your tickets before hand. I think the system is better now. Richard is a blast. We always made sure to get on his bus. He joked and laughed. He also gave great advice on food. He was just a fun, great guy all around. One night, we were riding and my mom who was at the top of the bus did not get off with us. She was in la la land? I don't know. Richard took my mom's phone and called her husband asking if she had left anything behind. It was hilarious. We laugh about it to this day.",164,3
"I understand that is billed as a \""boutique hotel\"" so I expected some level of quaintness. What I wasn't prepared for was run down and dirty. First of all, it's very easy to miss this place, we drove by it twice as it's wedged in between two other businesses and there is not a single hotel person (i.e. valet) waiting outside. We ended up having to call the front desk and ask where we were supposed to park the car to unload our bags. She seemed confused by this request and after a few minutes she told us just to leave the car in the service entrance behind the hotel. Weird! What hotel doesn't have some sort of established valet system for their guests arriving in cars. \n\nCheck in was fine and the staff was nice but I knew as I walked in this wasn't going to work out. The lobby was super small. It was cramped with four people waiting at the front desk. We were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite, so I was hopeful the room at least would be nice. The elevator was dark and dingy and barely fit two people with luggage. \n\nAs soon as we got to the room, the few hopes I had left were dashed. The room size was nice but it was just....dingy. The bed was lumpy, everything from the curtains to the dust ruffle were wrinkled and stained. The linoleum was cracked, the burner carpet looked like it had been there for roughly a hundred years. Needless to stay, we checked out immediately and headed to the W Hotel. I would highly recommend staying somewhere else unless this is your only option.",344,1
"First, the 4 star rating was for the beer and atmosphere...not the food. If it was a food rating i'd give it a 2. The dining room service is hit or miss, and the bartenders aren't bad. The food i've eaten (a salad, fish and chips, and the fried pickles) is okay. It's slightly overpriced, but when you're on the company dime it's not that bad. \n\nThat's not the reason we go, they have a great selection of draft and bottled beers. It's not the flying saucer or anything, but it's never disappointed. This is one of the regular spots we hit up whenever i'm in CLT. Great for having a beer or six and unwinding after work.",168,3

Apparently they have a genius that is managing this place because they took away the best thing about it; all the craft beer. That was the thing that made this place stand out knowing you can grab beers you couldn't get from home. Now it's just the same as every other casino bar. Stay away.,65,1
"This used to be my favorite weekday hangout, and on Thursdays it was usually packed (with underage drinkers) for karaoke. They eventually caught on and hired a bouncer. The bar soon went empty, but this was okay with me and my friends. It got rid of the \""Ohmigod, like, totally!\"" girls, and the \""oh, yeah bro\"" guys, and left room for us twenty somethings to stretch out a bit. There are still some older regulars and the occasional slip of the under-ager, but it doesn't effect us. There is a jukebox, pool table, and dart board if you get bored with the video poker machines, and the bartenders are always friendly. The food is decent, and there is a cozy dining room to sit in as well. Red Hawk is a nice bar (now) for a casual drink or game of pool if you're bored on a weekday night.",191,1

Pulled pork meat was bland at best almost tasted boiled, bun was soggy and the sauce tasted like ketchup and the onion rings were do greasy they dripped.

I'm guessing they just bank on hungry tired zoo visitors and the fact there really isn't much competition. Next time I'm at the zoo I'll just get a hot dog at one of the snack bars.",120,0
Rude staff and it takes at least an hour to get called up. They insist making appointments ahead of time but elderly folks find it difficult to use the automated appointment scheduling system.

"Not bad if you're stuck on the out skirts of town, the breakfast in the am IS NOT free, it's around $10 if you'd like eggs and sausage buffet,  $6 if you just want continental. They are doing some construction outside, seem to be expanding, so that's always a good sign :). Not many dining options in the area, McDonalds, Bojangles, Waffle House, etc., but getting back to City center is pretty easy. They have a shuttle that will pick you up from the airport, if you call when you land. The exercise room was pretty standard, 1 out of 3 treadmills worked, but a decent dumbbell selection\n\nThe only bad about the experience, was the house keeper, who behaved as if we were holding her up from something. As I walk out of my room she  yells down the hallway \""What time do you want service!?\"" I told her that I don't know, maybe around one, and she freaks out, and storms off.",216,2

"MLML always is looking for a good burger and we heard about Bachi Burger from a co-worker.\nBachi Burger is hidden in a small strip mall and has a touch of an Asian atmosphere.\nWe ordered the Bachi pickles for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised of the presentation.  Two small oblong trays of different items - cauliflower, beet, cucumber, and other  assorted veggies but the best was the garlic.  It was soaked in some teriyaki sauce or Yoshida's Gourmet Sauce and it tasted sweet not like a garlic at all.  I could have eaten a whole plateful of those.\nMLML ordered the Kiki burger which he devoured and i ordered the steamed duck sandwich or a version of the hum bao or manapua.  We were both very satisfied with our meals and the specialty dessert.\nThe service could have been better - they forgot a salad and seldom filled our drinks.\nThat was the first time we were there...\nI had to bring down the rating to 3 starts because the second time we were there, MLML ordered a burger with blue cheese which was not tasteful at all and I switched to the steam sandwich with the pork belly.  The pork belly had too much fat in it and I had to separate it.  Service was so-so.  Pickles were still great!\nI would go back to try the last steam sandwich option with the short rib.",291,2

Nothing was bad - just not particularly good - nothing to go back for - we had TOMATO SAUCE with goat cheese and TOMATO SAUCE with meatballs - notice the emphasis on \""tomato sauce\"".   I was unable to taste any goat cheese and the little hard bread chips were a waste of time.  The meatballs were fine, but so overpowered by the tomato sauce that the Moroccan spices were almost lost.  Oh, I have a problem with tomato sauce and have been suffering ever since lunch.  I thought I read the menu carefully and was unaware that both things we ordered would be so heavily doused with TOMATO SAUCE.  Somebody mentioned tomato salsa with their goat cheese, but we got TOMATO SAUCE  and lots of it.\n\nNice ambiance - pleasant waitress, fairly timely service, but ----",196,1

I could find something at the Salvation or Saver with just as good quality for half the price. As soon as I thought I had a keeper, I looked at the price and gasped. Really?!? $9-15 for something I would pay $3-7 at the most? I must be spoiled. \n\nThe selection at this new location was not impressive for my taste. I like finding gems, crazy cool vintage finds or something with cool patterns I could alter around for myself. I found nothing of the sort. I feel my hopes and expectations were set too high for this place being that I'm a thrift junkie and it's soo close to my area, but to sum it up in two words: over priced, comes to mind.\n\nSince the store was brand new, it was extremely clean and organized. Bathrooms were clean. Other than that, nothing impressed me and unless they drop their prices, I don't think I'll ever find my way back.\n\nTo confirm my disappointment, I felt compelled to stop by Savers and check out their prices. After spending an hour peeling through clothes, I was satisfies with the $15 spent there.",272,1
"This was my first time at The Palms Hotel.  Stayed for work.  It's very dated, very far away from everything.   \n\nChecked into room to find a 27\"" television, very dark room with one hall light and a desk lamp.  Brown carpet, walls and curtains.  Nothing in this room or hotel screams high end or luxury.  When asked if they could change my tv from a computer monitor to a real flat screen, they said no.  They said since they are in the process of the upgrading the monitors my floor hasn't been upgraded yet. \n\nI left my room at 9am and when i returned at 430, it still had not been cleaned.  When I called housecleaning they said they are 24 hours so they will get to it within 24 hours.  REALLY???  The customer service is horrible and not helpful.  \n\nThe restaurants are none that I've ever heard of, which equals BAD FOOD.  \n\nThe furniture is in really bad shape almost falling apart.

"I missed out on Tott's when it was located on Guadalupe & McClintock but I'm glad to see it didn't move far. \n\nAs fellow Yelpers have mentioned, a sure fire bet is the Orange Chicken. Much tastier than Panda Express and Pei Wei in my opnion. Comes with your choice of steamed or fried rice. Also, if you request it, they will make it spicier for you as everything is made to order. \n\nAnother good choice would be the Sweet and Sour Chicken, not as crunchy as the Orange Chicken but just as much flavor. It also comes with plenty of veggies and pineapple chunks, something that is really hard to come by at a place like Panda Exp. \n\nI think what really makes this restaurant better than some of your other fast food Chinese type locations is their friendliness and service. Every order I have made whether it be take out or dine in has been correct and really quick. Even with young workers behind the register, they are on top of everything and pay attention to your order. The owner is usually on hand cooking or serving which gives it a local feel rather than a chain. \n\nCheck it out if your in the area",254,3

"In Vegas, you will find hotels that are newer or more extravagant than the JW Marriott, but there are only a few that can match the old school class and elegance of this excellent desert haven.  It's not the first place to come to mind when you think of Vegas, but it only took one stay to convince me of its place among the premier hotels in Sin City.  It's not perfect and the layout is a bit odd, but it's definitely a laid back Vegas experience for those wanting less hustle and bustle.  \n\nPros\nFriendly staff\nClean and comfortable room - great bed\nNon-smoking property\nQuiet - feels more like a villa than a casino hotel\nFood options\n\nCons\nOff the strip - might disappoint those looking for a \""classic\"" Vegas experience\nNon-smoking property\n\nI don't know where to start because the whole experience was memorable.  From the super friendly check-in to the peaceful vibe of the resort property, I just cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  Other hotels try to impress you with how new or big their resort is, but the JW Marriott simply charms you with a combination of service and the desire to satisfy the guest.  If you're tired of the loud and hectic environment of the strip hotels, then you're in for a pleasant surprise desert getaway.  \n \nThe hotel is off the strip - that's really my only negative comment.  I guess you can say that the hotel's architecture isn't as impressive as the newer monstrosities or that the casino floor is dead compared to the ones on the strip, but these things also lend to the overall character of the JW Marriott.  By the way, by not being on the strip, you avoid the usual drunk and annoying folks that you meet in the elevators and casinos.   \n\nThe hotel is perfect for couples or families.  You won't get the typical Vegas experience but it's kind of nice being surrounded by golf courses and private homes.  The breakfast buffet was awesome - I highly recommend getting the breakfast at all JW Marriott and Marriott hotels: waffles and omelets cooked to order, not to mention the fresh fruits and other hot foods.  I will post a separate review, but The Carmel Room is a \""can't miss\"" dining experience.  My wife wants to go back to Vegas just to eat there, again. \n\nThere are only a handful of hotels that I like to stay at while in Vegas, and the JW Marriott is on that short list.  With specials, the rooms are quite affordable, and although it's a quieter experience than staying on the Strip - it doesn't diminish the Vegas experience one bit.  This hotel is an excellent example of the Marriott chain and makes me want to visit the other JW Marriott locations across the world.",605,4

"Everyone loves a bit of Cex (sorry, I had to go there before someone else did).\n\nSeriously though, if you've not got into this shop you most definitely should. Cex is where the appeal of a second hand music store meets a games exchange. \n\nWhen I first had a look around I thought it was merely the latter, as you are faced with the games section as you enter the store. I was impressed enough with that - there were a fair few, fairly recent DS games for a fiver, and some recent XBox games for under 20 quid. But when I turned a corner I was faced with even more mind blowing bargains. I spotted a Red Dwarf \""just the Shows\"" boxset for a shockingly good 8 quid, and some recent stand up comedy DVDs for just under 2 quid. They had enough DVD's to rival Fopp, and an eclectic mix of music that is obviously a mish mash of everyone's exchanges.\n\nOverall, I loved it. I have a few movies and CD's on my to do list that I'll pick up next week. Including a Dogtanian cartoon for 75p. He was my childhood hero and arguably worth so much more to me than that, but who am I to argue with a bargain like that? It's a steal!",283,3
"Decontamination chamber.  Stat!\n\nI cave to the kids and come here about two times a year. It's always crowded and the pizza is mediocre at best, but the cinnamon rolls are passable and that's what sticks in my brain and causes some sort of experience amnesia. \n\nSafe to say tonight's visit will not soon be forgotten. The place was packed tonight. Seemed to be a four child per family minimum. I soon realized that preschool aged children were being allowed to help themselves to the buffet.  One little guy dropped his food on the floor and then proceeded to sit there and eat it off the floor.  He was spotted by a parent/person with his parent who merely said \""you're nasty\"" and then turned back around to continue eating and talking. That's the Cici's clientele folks.  \n\nThe temperature inside the dining area must have been 90 degrees.  Pretty much unbearable. I heard a customer say something to the manager and his response was \""you think you're hot?  Imagine how hot we are (the workers)!\""  Oooookay!  \n\nAs for the food, I can honestly say the pizza was the worst I've ever had there.  They were quick about refilling it, but they had very little variety and they all just tasted bland and awful.  They had the standard cheese, pepperoni, pep and sausage, a white veggie, a sausage and a deep dish with cheese.  It looked like the spots were labeled for the staff and these must be the standard choices now.  No Hawaaiin, taco, supreme, BBQ, buffalo or anything even slightly creative. However, the desserts were represented - even the gooey cinnamon rolls. Again, they were the ONLY highlight of the evening.\n\nIt's been a few hours and so far no food poisoning, so feeling optimistic about that.  I also feel optimistic that that was finally my last Cici's visit.",422,0

Everything on the menu is pretty self explanatory I mean eggs, crepes, fruit plates how difficult can these things be right? Well, I guess it was difficult. It took a long time for our food to get to us and when our food did finally get to us it took a long time to get the check. Our waiter kept trying to make small talk with us to help with the waiting but he didn't do a good job because he made us even more upset that we were waiting for so long. \n\nThe duck crepe was good but I definitely would not wait an hour for it!",146,1

He was so rude and confront ative to us and got right into one of our family members faces when we said we were going somewhere else.  We were waiting outside for our car to come back and pick us up and the manager and his buddy even walked out to the parking lot while we were waiting and just stood there and stared at us!

I've been to this restaurant three times now.... the first two were very good. However my last visit was not so good. \n\nThe waiter Brian was anything but attentive. The large version of the burnt ends arrived cold. I  finally was able to grab a manager to send it back to be heated as Brian was no where in site. I ordered coffee with cream and he never asked if I wanted a refill... nor did he ever bring the cream I asked him for three times. And he never checked on us or asked if everything was alright until the end of the meal. \n\nThe bottom line.... the food is always tasty (when hot) but the service on this trip was simply horrid. I'm not sure if I will go back.,160,1
"Price wise it is actually really good.  If I was to live around the neighborhood, this place would definitely a place of choice for quick eating. \n\nWhen I see a 5-star place with 5+ reviews for a cheap eatery, to me this means it is worth driving there from time to time. Well this is place isn't that kind.. I don't think I'll go there again.. It is just not worth the drive for me.  I had chicken and beef sandwich.. The taste of the meat was good because it is charcoal grill. I had all dressed and it was too much sauce for me. I was hoping other tangible ingredients, not just the dressing.  \nUnfortunately, they don't have plate size for one person. The plate starts from 1/2 kg of meat and it is too much for a person. \n\nAgain, it is an OK place and I would like to have a place like this in my area..

We probably couldve driven to Summerlin and been eating before out dinner came out here. \n\nSERVICE: ALARMINGLY SLOW. Couldnt believe it took SOOOO long. We got there around 645. It took over an HOUR to get our food. The place was kinda empty. I ordered a cobb salad and he ordered rice and shrimp. last time I ckd shrimp cooks really fast? so I dont knwo what took an hour other than poor communication. \nTheres someone to give you water, theres another person to give you your food, theres a differen person to take your order. We saw the water girl way more than we saw our server, which at this point we decided they jsut forgot to turn in the order and that must be why it took that long. the table in front of us had more people, sat down after us and ate and left and we still had yet to take our first bite. sad. \n\nFOOD: the plate was ok, not anythign I'd order again. THe bacon was good and crunchy which I like but oh so greasy. . to the point it made me sick. i wasnt alone... my bf felt fine till I gave him a bite of the bacon oops I mean grease with bacon. ah .. lets put it this way. the food @ Hard Rock Cafe was way better and we all know they arent known for great cuisine.  \nwould I come back? no I would not. Its a 24 hr place but so is walmart and mcdonald's.",425,1

"This place just missed getting a 5 star review from me - and I'm taking off a star because they dropped the ball a couple of times and I would be willing to return, as the food is pretty good and I'd like to try some other items on the menu.  Starting with drinks, we had one of the fru-fru- cocktails that are handmade from special ingredients, not your run of the mill items, so did it cost a lot - heck yes, but you're on vacation and if you want a fun night out, go ahead and order the Blackbeard Special - it's quite the daiquiri.\nWe ordered from the Prix Frix menu - as we had tickets to see Cher that night and needed to get to the big MGM stadium in time for the show.\nThe menu included your choice of many items...I chose the Little Gem Lettuce Caesar salad - just enough of the salad to leave you wanting for me - perfectly made and with a tasty dressing that was very memorable.\nSecond I had the Sweet Corn Bisque - please order this - you won't be sorry...they do it all fancy table side with fresh ingredients and poured hot soup directly onto those fresh items for a lick the bowl clean soup that makes you wish you could order a crockpot full of this stuff.\nThen the trouble started...5 minutes, 10 minutes go by and no main course - I ordered the Broiled Halibut, so I know it isn't being blackened or something else that has to be cooked for a long time....finally the Maitre 'D shows up and apologizes for the long wait, saying our entrees took a little longer than expected...another 5 minutes, 10 minutes and finally they show up...waiting that long - you're already disappointed...could be the best fish I ever ate, but waiting that long really was irritating...even with a cute Maitre 'D, have to take off a star - this is an expensive restaurant $65 for the Prix Frix, so come on guys, get with it...you have an army of service people....some dropped the ball on this part.\nOkay fish was pretty tasty, so I'll give you that...now we're getting to have to worry about our dessert as the wait time was so long for the entree, we may not have time to enjoy...I ordered the Huckleberry cobbler - guess what?  They're out of it on a busy 3 Day Holiday weekend - Wah Wah....Thought about taking ANOTHER star off, but they bounced back and brought us the entire selection of desserts out fit for an army, and they were all great, especially the chocolate cake (even though Emeril is famous for the Banana Cream Pie - we got that too) - the cake - wow - we couldn't eat it all obviously - so they packed it up for us and we took it into the MGM arena...So overview - great spot - bring money - if we go back and we have bad service - I'm taking them down a couple of stars - You have been warned Emeril - BAM!",644,3
"Wow! Great service. Walked and was immediately (and warmly) greeted by the nice woman at the register. I ordered a large Papa's Favorite. It only took a few minutes for my pizza to be ready. The man who made the pizzas was extremely nice, too! \n\nGot home and just had a few slices - it's really delicious pizza. You can't beat it for the price. And $10 Tuesdays?! Score! I'll DEFINITELY be back!",105,4
"I went to this location on 9/26 for lunch. It was OK. I ordered the spicy miso burger protein style and it was fine. It wasn't bad, it was even pretty good. It is just hard to get excited about this place. The service is OK. Not good but not bad. Definitely slow and not attentive. \n\nUnless someone orders their fries as an appetizer, they probably want them with their meal, not 20 minutes ahead of time.  The house made pickles were good. \n\nI was excited to see that they have Boba, but I didn't try it. I would not choose to go back, but if a friend wanted to, I would go with them.",153,2
"This spot is right in our neighborhood, but because we have a favorite sushi place nearby, we had never tried it. A friend told us to try it. We were not disappointed! \nMy husband and I really dislike the \""Scottsdale Sushi\"" experience where women are falling out of their dresses, music is loud and the sushi tastes like it was made last week.....worse yet, the people eating it don't know the difference. \nWhen we walked in the door at Hiro we knew we were in for a treat. A true Sushi room, Hiro is all about the Sushi. No music was playing, the sushi chefs were artists. Sitting at the bar was a joy. Eating in the presence of true Sushi lovers was also a joy. The Sashimi my husband ordered was \""the freshest he has tasted\"" and everything else was amazing. For a little more money, we enjoyed fantasic sushi in a tiny and cozy space with great energy and wonderful service. This will be our spot from now on!",207,4

"I like most Starbucks. The only thing that can ruin a Starbucks is poor management, since otherwise they are very much alike.  Although restaurant size and the presence of outdoor seating and sufficient outlets for laptops do affect my review.\n\nThis Starbucks has always been clean when I've visited, and has friendly staff. It's not particularly large, but I've been in smaller ones. This is one of the stores that serves food- a few sandwiches, cheese plates (yay, brie!), etc, along with cookies and pastries. No complaints!",114,2

"Holy smokes! I spent more time driving then I did in the store and I was only a minute or so away. I walked in, saw the gun I was looking for, saw the price and saw the exit. I've been shopping around for a 715t and Sportmans had it for 299 which was high. The tag on the Mossberg 715t (remind you it's just a 702 plinkster in a fake AR body) for 390!! DANG! For 79 bucks more I can go to Sportsmans and buy the S&W MP15 which is a real 22lr AR. This place must be feeding off ill-informed people. I wonder if they have a \""I know what Im doing\"" price. $390?? really?",176,1
"I love Ocean Club! We have eaten here many times as we live very close. The service is attentive and what should be expected from a fine dining restaurant. I swear I could just live off the pretzel bread and butter cake! They have an extensive wine list and their cocktails are also very generous portions. The lobster mashed potatoes are delicious and last time I was here I had the big eye tuna, which was cooked to perfection! Love love love this restaurant!",94,4
"Can you imagine a place where everything is absolutely delicious, the staff is very kind and the ambiance is nice? This is it! I've tried the scones sal\u00e9s, the breads, the croque monseigneur, the quiches, the soup, the muffins, fondants, cookies... I'm never disappointed! Verdun needed and deserved a place like this!",81,4

"Took my little dude here after he had to get a surprise Hep A shot. Needless to say he was P.O.'d at me (who can blame him?) so I thought some ice cream would make it all better and put me back in his good graces. It worked! \n\nThe lady behind the counter was super cool and even gave my boy thumbs up for being so brave (he barely cried...such a toughie). She brought him a scoop of vanilla custard with a waffle cone (his first cone ever). He wolfed it down the typical way 3 year old boys do (all over his face, down his shirt and around his car seat).\n\nI opted for the Mt. Rush s'more concrete made with vanilla custard, hot fudge, marshmallow creme and graham cracker crumbs. So freaking tasty for the few bites I had (I needed to bring home the rest for my other little monkey so she didn't feel left out). \n\nWill. always go to Mr. D's for our family special treats.",219,3
"Out of Hefe-Weizen?  That's not cool.  Otherwise, beers were decent and the Irish Stout is probably their most appealing beer for craft beer lovers.  I was able to get free samples and it was a nice touch to have my pint to go in a plastic cup for mall shopping.",65,2
"Brought several items into store in April, 2014.  They never inform you of any sales, you must stop in and inquire. the website and email mentioned in their brochure do NOT respond to any inquires. After checking sale inventory monthly, now I told that except for a few dollars in sale monies, they have \""donated\"" one of my items and my inventory is all gone.  where? donated to whom?  what a screwed up method of trying to collect your monies.  get some high schools to design a system.  They can't figure out how to notify you via email when there is a sale??   SELLER BEWARE",137,1

"Weird vibe here. The drinks were overly priced (e.g., $27 for a Grey Goose & Cran), but strong. The seahorses are cute, but not like a main draw. There are so many other amazing places to grab drinks that have much better atmospheres...why stop here?",61,1
"I forgot how much fun a library can be.  So much I had to visit it twice in the week.  \n\nIt has been years since I stepped foot into a library, what with all the media at our fingertips from our computers to our phones we forget about these oases that are filled with free knowledge.  It was nice to just putz around inside the walls of this library.\n\nI filled out an application for a library card and thought to myself that I would come back at another time and pick something out.  On my way out however, my mind had other plans.  I saw a book I've been wanting to read for a while and been too stingy to buy it.  Lo and behold with my new found power of the library card, I was able to take that book with me that day and I'm already halfway through that book.  \n\nNot to mention if you need to get on the Internet in a pinch you can do it here.  Even at it's busiest, I think there were still free computers to use.  If you haven't been to a library branch lately, you really ought to get out and discovery one soon.  It's quite the eye opening experience.",262,3
"I seriously can't say enough good stuff about this Yardhouse location. I had never been to one prior to living in Las Vegas so this one will always hold a special spot in my heart! The service is always super friendly and because I have a knack for modifying their cocktails, the bartenders tend to remember who I am =) I highly recommend getting the \""Gin and Ginger\"" but tell them to sub Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey for the gin..TRUST ME! Every person who tastes/straw tests it ends up falling in love! And you're welcome!!",114,4
I really liked the massaman curry here but then the food poisoning.... errrr not so much.\n\nGreat service though!,28,1
"This was my first visit and I checked online first for the best reviews by Val vista rd and I figured I was safe here.  Unfortunately it's another place with bad English and no one was listening to me when I said I wanted a shellac manicure.  I said it when I came in, I said it sitting down with the lady, and then I said it again when they told me to pick out a nail polish.  Of course they nodded and said yes, yes shellac!  They were all opi's and I knew something was wrong because they were no shellacking nail polishes up front so I figured they must have a different process (or I was hoping that).  What did they do?  They painted my nails with the nail polish, clear coated, and then stuck me under the uv lamp.  $15 for a job I didn't want and now the tips are chipping two days later.  I've only given them another star because the other lady did a really nice job on my friends nails.  Obviously I would never come here for a shellac finish.  A white tip manicure...possibly.",237,1
"Kitson in LA is one of my favorite stops and this one totally picks up the same vibe.\nIt's a great one stop shopping for fun/cute gifts for friends and babies/kids. The brands are higher end but not exclusive, meaning that if you take the time to look elsewhere and shop around, you can buy the same items for less.\nThat being said, I find it's a very convenient shop since they've selected to stock items in such a way that you don't need to weed through things - pretty much everything here will be well received. Love their selection of books for adults and kids and cute household items and kids clothes too!",138,3
"Went for Friday Happy Hour with Natasha.  Best HH we've ever been to!\n\nWhat's not to like?  Cheap martinis, food specials, great crowd, enough seating, free parking.  And the all-girl band!  Every song they played was on Natasha's Ipod.  How cool is that?\n\nWe ordered the tenderloin flatbread and the lobster tacos.  Both were delish.  I did think however that they were a little skimpy with the tenderloin on the flatbread.\n\nBlue Martini is in a happening outdoor mall called Town Square.  Kinda what The Grove (in LA) wishes it could be.  It's a good distance south of the strip, but worth the drive.  We'll be going back, and probably make a night of it and go over to Pete's Duelling Pianos.",188,4
"OI. I reallllly wanted to like this place. \n\nAfter my last review, one of the owners reached out and emailed me, apologized and asked me to give them another shot. Love how much they care about their customers. \nThe remodel they have done is AMAZING! I loved the enclosed patio area, so cool, literally, I thought the temp would be horrible back there but it was so nice. \n\nFirst off, the hostess. Sweetest girl ever! She told us it looked like a 20-25 minutes wait and that we could find a spot on the patio and enjoy a drink while we waited for our table. We lucked out and found a spot, this place was SLAMMING for a Tuesday! A nice waitress in a skirt that ALMOST showed some butt cheek came over and took our order. We were hungry so we ordered some guacamole to tide us over for our \""twenty five minute wait\"". 30 minutes go by and we think that the waitress has totally forgotten about our order. I go up to the hostess to see how much longer we have to go \""you are next\"" she says, Rad! 5 minutes later out comes our gauc, finally. The gauc was decent, we all loved the chips, they were like crack. Another TWENTY minutes goes by, so now we have waited double over what our estimated time of wait was. I really wish she would have been honest with us and just said its going to be a 45 Min- Hour wait. It was CLEAR when she gave us the 20-25 minute wait she was either fudging to keep us there, or had no clue on how to quote a wait for a table. But seriously, sweetest girl ever. \n\nFINALLY we get shown to our table. We are EXCITED. We have been dying to try this place out. Like I mentioned in my first review, the MIL lives in the neighborhood behind the Vig, so we are fans of places we can walk to! The waitress actually cracked a joke about how we probably all know what we wanted to eat since we had waited so long. \n\nThe food came out relatively fast....the fries were all warm, but all the sandwiches were luke warm at best. Im pretty sure mine and the hubs were meant to be hot. Our cheese was melty but everything else was room temp/luke warm. \n\nLets start with mine first, the honey ham & provolone. I took one bite and was astonished by its lack of flavor. It should have been bursting with flavor, it had ham, provolone cheese, grilled pineapple, dijon mayo and a pablono chile! It was flavorless. The only thing that had flavor was the chile that brought mad heat. I tried a few bites with out the chile to get the flavor of the sandwich, zero. I cut off a piece for the hubs and MIL to try to see if it wasn't just me. Nothing. It was a luke warm pile of meat and cheese that tasted like nothing. At least I had some sweet potato fries to munch. \n\nNext up the hubs, He got the uptown steak sandwich, Asked for it medium. It had sliced bistro tenderloin with wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, arugula, roasted red peppers, Swiss cheese and horseradish mayo on a sub roll. First off, they cut the sandwich in half for you which is awesome, but had the chef been paying attention he would have seen the middle ends of the sandwich were verging on RAW (like red)!! So gross. The hubs picked all the raw looking pieces out, took a bite, NO FLAVOR! A sandwich that has roasted red peppers and caramelized onions and horsey mayo should for sure have flavor!?! This was not the case, he cut a piece off for each of us to try. We all looked at each other in disbelief, how could there be no flavor. Really people, this is not an over exaggerated story, I wish it were. He also got onion rings. Now in my family, onion rings get devoured, in fact fights usually occur as to who gets the last ring. We each take an onion ring, now have you ever eaten those fried batter pieces at the bottom of the Long John Silvers fish baskets? Those little clumps of fried batter that have zero taste? Well, that was what these onion rings tasted like, a bunch of fried nothing. \n\nLastly the MIL's Turkey sandwich. It had turkey breast with dill havarti, cranberry chutney, roasted tomatoes, cole slaw and honey-mustard mayo on pretzel bread. We all swooned at the pretzel bun! This one wasn't as tasteless as mine and the husbands sandwiches. It was ok. She also ordered the regular french fries. Those were good. \n\nI know this review is getting long and winded, but I want to give an honest full run down of why I gave only 2 stars. \n\nOur waitress only came back once to check on us and was never to be seen until the check came. A different waiter came by and asked if we wanted boxes as each of our plates looked completely untouched. We all said no (in unison). \n\nIt for sure has a nice happy hour atmosphere and prices. That has got to be a reason why this place was packed both times we have gone (530-6ish). I've never been to the 1st location to compare the two food and service wise. It has tons of potential, and it looks like plenty of people love The Vig, maybe we went on an off night? I'm sorry Vig, you are just not for me.",1190,1
"Intro:\nI'm beginning to believe that the buffets have better steak than the glam steakhouses on the Strip.\n\nFood:\nWine:  We asked for a '04 Chateauneuf Du Pape, and the waiter brought an '06.  When I informed the waiter that it's an '06, he tried to convince me that an '06 is just as good as the '04.  Uhm, nooooo buddy.\n\nFresh Oysters:  *sigh*  They only had one kind...and not Kumamoto.  As I slurped up my couple of oysters, I was yearning for Sea Salt, for Hog Island, for Inverness.\n\nFoie Gras, served on top of fuji apples and toast:  The foie gras was simply \""foie gras\"", of the fatty and juicy variety, which is just fine by me.\n\n8 oz Tenderloin, Oscar Style:  Granted, I've never had my steak Oscar style (a lump of crab and asparagus on top).  I requested to have my steak cooked according to the chef's recommendation, and it was perfectly medium rare.  I probably won't order a steak Oscar style again, but that doesn't mean that the chef's execution was poor.  Quite the contrary.\n\nService:\nWe started on a bad foot with the wine episode (see above).  After that, he did his best to make amends.\n\nOverall:\nLes Artistes probably wouldn't be my first choice restaurant.  The food is decent, but incredibly overpriced - but then again, it's Vegas.",349,1
I should have known after the first failed attempt that this company wouldn't work out. I was quoted a price for bi-weekly yard maintenance that included check and maintaining  my sprinkler system.  When they showed up the guy try to charge me extra and I told them to leave if I wasn't going to be charge what I was quoted. I called Sergio and he explained that it was a miss communication and he would send the guys back.  The next time they came the same guy the cause problems the first time made me feel really uncomfortable. He started talking about how he had been to the house during the week and where was I why wasn't I home. (my service was set up for Saturday mornings) I was a bit freaked out by this.  I called Sergio again.  The next time they came my husband went to the door. They showed up at 6am on Saturday morning. My husband asked why where they there so early and that we couldn't have loud noise in the neighborhood that early in the morning. They never came back. They also left me with 6 broken sprinklers and a water leak.   \n\nI paid for the first two visits in advance. Now I am getting bills from Sergio saying that I owe for more. I am glad that I read the Yelp reviews about not giving him my credit card information.,281,0
"This place has somehow achieved cult status in Phoenix,  but I just don't see the draw.  I like a fired crust,  but the crust here was so blackened it was like eating burnt toast.  Not good. The fennel sausage tasted like,  well fennel,  and not much else.  It's like they said \""hey,  let's take the worst flavor in sausage and make it the star!\"" So the food is certainly overrated,  but there are other problems here as well. Namely,  parking.  They have one tiny lot that depending on when you go may or may not be valet only.  Since there was no other option,  we used the valet. Three dollars to watch him park our car literally fifteen feet from where we stopped. Bizzare. And then there are your fellow diners. Lots of Ed Hardy wearing dudebros when we were there. Not really our scene.  I don't think we will be back here considering there are so many better pizza joints in the valley.",214,1
"This place was so fun!  There were so many famous faces everywhere!  I didn't expect to see so many celebrities or expect the place to be as big as it was.  The rooms are separated by musicians, athletes, actors, presidents and other miscellaneous people standing around.  There was no wait to get in at 6pm on a sunday evening.  It was not crowded and everyone inside had a chance to take pictures with whomever they wanted.  There was a interactive Scream! show that had famous villains like Michael Meyers and Freddie Krueger inside but I was too chicken to go in!  Overall, very fun place, don't forget your camera!",138,4

Wasnt really feeling it. If your in the neighborhood I guess it's worth it but don't make the drive. The food was just okay the service was really good but couldn't redeem my  tummies disappointment.

For all you know, it's part of the laundromat next door. \n\nCoffee isn't bad and it never seems to be too busy so it's actually an undercover great spot to get some things done without worry of distraction.

I went there for an exam and he had me look through two lenses, never asked me how I could see the letter, after the 15 seconds of the two lenses he told me my prescription was going to stay the same. Never looked into whether my vision has gotten any better or worse and didn't take the time to seem to care. I did complain to the manager Rachel who was wonderful in understanding and didn't charge me for the visit.\nI did make it clear I would not return to their vision centers with doctors of that knowledge.

"We went to this restaurant when we arrived in Las Vegas after a long road trip. \n\nThe service was SLOW. The waiter forgot to bring our drinks, he was always running everywhere in the (empty) restaurant but never to serve us. It took 45 min to receive our meals! The burgers were average, the French fries don't come along with the meal, you have to pay extra bucks for fries.  My boyfriend took the nachos plate, it was good. The place was empty, we felt like no one cared about us, the waiter was never around us. This place has nothing to do with HAWAII. It's a shame. \n\nIt is quite expensive too, and the waiter didn't get his tips (it took 15 min to get the bill). I put a note explaining why.\n\nDon't go there, they just don't care about the food neither they care about their customers.",201,0

"Yelp 100 Challenge * 53/100\n\nFind Hash House A Go Go at The Quad (where the Imperial Palace would have been) Heavy construction work is underway so don't be surprised if you find yourself navigating a labyrinth of a path to get here. (Apparently, renovation/alteration is not done yet!) \n\nFamily Tuesday cannot happen this week with schoolwork (and everything in between) piling up for me so I convinced my parents to follow our adventurous compass and head here today. When we got to the first floor, I scanned the celebrity guests whose signatures lined menus in the waiting room outside the restaurant and saw a picture of Adam Richman from Man vs. Food taking a shot at the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle Tower! Sold. We agreed to share what sounded like a mutated chicken and waffle combo. And we were right. It was ginormous! That and an extra order of Basic on the side which included 2 sunny side ups, ham, 2 wheat bread with butter and diced potatoes and I was charged with all the necessary carbs that lasted me for the whole day. My parents were too stuffed to elaborate about their meal by the time we were done, but I'm assuming they had a blast. American portions still get pretty overwhelming for us (and to think that we were already sharing our orders)\n\nPapa couldn't help commenting that the fried chicken was just the right level of crispy and mommy loved how the waffles had bacon stuffed in it. I would hop here for breakfast more often if only the construction below wasn't as disruptive as it was. Over the course of our meal, we heard someone drilling beneath the floor of the party next to us. We could literally feel the ground shake and servers were shaking their heads in frustration. Thankfully everyone was taking it with a grain of salt and light-hearted humor (Someone joked that they thought it was their baby making all the noise) 5 stars without the noise. Perhaps another stop in the future will up my update review.",425,3

"Not recommend service department\nI do not write many reviews so when I do, they are reality. Chapman Dodge service department in Scottsdale has much to be desired. I have no experience with the car sales so this relates only to service dept. 4 times in to get my cruise control fixed (under warranty) and still broke. The last time I took it in Service tech Dave Colwell siad well it's been a while since you last had it in for the same repair. (Hmm, 3 months is a long time?)  I emailed the service manager Tina on this. Received a message back. I called and emailed her and no reply. Here is the kicker. I have delt with Chapman Chevrolet in Tempe for 10 years and they are awesome. Same company? I think not. Chapman Dodge is Scottsdale is owned by a nother family member. One additional note at Chapman Chevrolet in Tempe my cars always came back spotless clean. At  Chapman Dodge in Scottsdale this is much to be desired. My recomendation is not a good choice to have your Dodge or Chrysler serviced.",223,1

"What a waste of gas and money. \n\nI made the drive from Mesa and I was utterly disappointed. The shop is small, hot and not up to my standard of cleanliness. But I was there and I had to try them. \n\nWe order the mango mousse and pistachio macaron. The mango mousse is layered between cake and has mango gelee on top. The cake was flavorless and dry, the mousse lacked flavor and could barely tell it was supposed to taste like mango and it was dry. How do you get dry mousse??? Ask Eorupean Bakery, they should be able to tell you. Mango mousse? Mango not.\n\nThe macaron was a disaster. It was over baked and the shell was nothing but a giant air bubble, being hollow inside. The filling wasn't spread out and only had some in the middle. My biggest issue with the pistachio macaron was that it was not pistachio! It you're going to make a pistachio macaron, you are supposed to use pistachio meal, not almond meal like traditional macaron. You can't use 90% almond and 10% pistachio and tint it green and call is pistachio. No, just no. How do you sell macaron so sub par to your customers? \n\nWhile \""enjoying\"" our sweets, we observed the staff with couple of other customers and their cake orders. The cake looked good on the outside but what is it with their packaging?? If someone orders a large sheet cake, can you provide a little more than just a flimy box bottom? Use a cardboard and a real box that's actually big enough for the cake please. The service was slow and their napkin holders were out of napkins and I brought it to their attention but they never refilled it.",372,0
"This is a large bar basically, but they happen to serve really flavorful food and unusually low prices for vegas. It's not \""cheap\"" food, but what you do get for what they charge is good. We skip the carvery section (pricey) and just order the rest of the menu.\n\nIf you like pretzels, theirs are good. Best dip is the ware rarebit appetizer. Lobster rolls are great, the mini pastrami sandwiches are a win as well. They do a burger with pastrami added, it's also good.\n\nThe real treat is the shepards pie. the beef inside is flavor packed and it's just a big hot cast iron skillet of comfort food. The skirt steak with ribeye chili on top is also flavorful and a definite winner.\n\nThey do a really good twist on a manhattan called The Excellent Crystal. Oh and they have a ton of beers on tap as well. Honestly if you wanted to sit and just eat bar food, drink draft beer and watch sports, i'd go here (and often do).  If you make it to dessert, the bread pudding is delicious.\n\nNow the bar games...\n\nAround the bar you'll find up lit small hourglasses. They are set to 7 second. Order any pint (Guinness is really the best bet for speed). With hand on glass, but glass on bar, they flip the hourglass, you drink. no side drafting beer out of your mouth and nothing left over and you get the pint for free.\n\nBefore you get excited, you can only do it twice I believe. Which brings us to the next game, Make a shot, take a shot.  They have a couple basketball hoops on teh bar (it's easier now than it used to be), sink the nerf ball, free shot. They have made this easier.\n\nSolid food, good flavor, reasonable prices and on strip.  Pretty rare.",411,3
"I absolutely loved the Aria for several different reasons.\n\nIt's quite the new commodity and it's very clean, trendy, and feels fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend stay here with my boyfriend celebrating our 3.5 year anniversary. \n\nA friend gave me a discount code/promotion so we saved about 200-300 dollars. With the promotion, I received a free upgrade to the city panorama room which was gorgeous. We also had $50 credit to spend each night we were there (so a total of $100).\n\nThey also have a really great Tapas place called Julian Serranos which is located to the left of the check-in/concierge stand. SO GOOD. YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE WHEN YOU BOOK A STAY AT THE ARIA.\n\nI absolutely had a blast and the rooms were gorgeous. We also got upgraded to the 52nd floor (out of 54) so our view was beyond spectacular. They have free wifi, the pools were so nice and relaxing, and my boyfriend said he probably had the best haircut of his entire life (he better have cause that sh*t was $75)!\n\nI HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this place to couples wanting to get away! :)",271,4

"Friday night in Pittsburg and I decided to go to Sonoma Grill. Finding parking was crazy since all the parking garages were full, so luckily found some alley way parking. I was late for my reservation but I was seated quickly. This place was live- friendly older crowd. The waiter was nice and suggested the tappas. The server who served us the tappas struggled to place the food on this wooden stand and he looked like he was sick, since he was coughing all over the place. The tappas were great but I wasn't a fan of the brushcetta (tasted goaty) and the scallops with sweet potato pur\u00e9 was too sweet. Otherwise, the canelloni was very filling & filet mignon just melted in my mouth it was amazing.",159,2
"We stopped by here after Ash Wednesday mass today.  This is a peel your own, get down and dirty type of eatery.  They also give you a bib to protect your clothes from getting sauced or whatnot.\n\nFor $40, this is what we got:\n-1 Dungeness Crab:  We got this with the lemon pepper sauce with medium spicy.  The dungeness crab was good, but the lemon pepper sauce didn't do much for it.\n-1lb of shrimp:  We got this with the big bang sauce, which is a mixture of all the other sauce, at a medium spicy as well.  Those were large shrimps and were a tad  bit undercooked, which is fine by me since I rather have them undercooked than overcooked.   I didn't care for the sauce.\n-Turons:  Came 5 in an order.  I asked the server whether these were freshly made and fried, and have not been sitting out since earlier today.  She said they were freshly made and fried.  I took a bite off of one and it certainly did not taste freshly made and fried. \n\nThey have a special where Monday is crawfish for $6.99/lb and Wednesday is shrimp for $6.99/lb.  Without the special, they are $10.99/lb.  I tried the shrimp today, not a fan, so will not be coming back to try their Monday crawfish.\n\nService was pleasant, but won't be coming back for the food.",333,1

Another \""drug\"" related incident was the confiscation of eye drops in the nightclub, because apparently there's drug usage there too.

I don't know, but they don't have the same appeal to me as they did before. \n\nThey still have a lot of classes and time slots (except Cool Flow Prenatal Vinyasa). A lot of the teacher are still around which is a HUGE plus... But the vibe before and after class sucks (pardon my language).\n\nI want to give it a \""Meh.

When I went to pick it up at their office, both office staff acted incompetently and were unfriendly. This was a simple request that should have been handled quickly and efficiently, but these 2 girls are apparently unable to provide that kind of care.

Yes, I am sure I could cook lunch on my own, but I have been having so much fun making elaborate dinners the past couple of nights that I much prefer having someone else make me lunch. Fair, right? Anyway, I stopped into Cowbell around 2PM yesterday to get a quick lunch- I was seated at a tall table and was immediately approached by a very friendly server. Cute girl. She brought me a Diet Coke and suggested a couple of signature burgers- I got the one with an egg on it- so good. I was also surprised to see mac and cheese as a featured side- HELLO, when in doubt, always get mac and cheese. Always. I really, really love mac and cheese.\n\nAll in all, a good lunch.

"Sigh. We were *really* looking forward to this after all the stellar reviews. I've been to Vegas many times and always thought the best sushi would be at some swank place on The Strip, but Yelp claimed otherwise.\n\nThe good: The food was, overall, fine. We didn't do All You Can Eat because my wife wanted two orders of sashimi (salmon and hamachi). Both were excellent. Nice large meaty pieces, well trimmed, nicely presented. We had two rolls each, which were fine but nothing special. I also had two orders of nigiri.\n\nThe bad: We arrived around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was MAYBE half full. It more than half hour before our first piece of food came out. It was 40 minutes before I saw any of my order. The (nice) server came by at 30 minutes and offered us free miso soup to help pass the time. Meanwhile we watched every other table in the place get multiple orders of sushi delivered. Completely unimpressed, and cost them several stars.\n\nOther issues: I asked if they had aji bones they could deep fry, and the server went off to find out but never came back to tell me yes or no. My aji nigiri had the tiniest pieces of aji I've ever eaten on top. It tasted fine, but they amounted to table scraps, not at all like the beautiful pieces of sashimi my wife got.",311,1

"I sometimes write out my reviews as if they were definite facts but I'll just outright say that this time I am being picky and the following opinions are all a matter of my own personal preference. \n\nIf M-bay was the nicest hotel you've stayed at on the strip, then you would probably think everything I complained about is petty. But if you have stayed anywhere nicer, then you might be able to understand where I'm coming from. Like they say, ignorance is bliss. \n\nPros\n1. The shampoo/conditioner had a really nice smell. Reminded me of orange flavored candy. \n2. Key cards came with two free drink vouchers that could be used at pretty much any of the m-bay bars/lounges. \n3. Express checkout via the television\n4. Two couches. Although I didn't get much use out of them, those extra couches would be convenient if you are trying to cram a group of people into that room. \n5. Tram that goes to luxor and excalibur. \n6. Their website gave $89 as their lowest rate but I found a lower rate on another site and they gave me the lower price without any problems. Don't be afraid to call them to ask if you find a lower price elsewhere.\n\nCons\n1. No bath products (as in bubble bath)\n2. No bathrobes\n3. I had trouble using the keycards. It always took me 4-5x in order to get the door open. \n4. There is no master light. When you enter the room, the first light you can turn on is for the hallway. In order to light up the room, you have to individually turn on all the lamps. \n5. Shallow safe. \n6. It said on their website that toothpaste is an amenity, got to the room and no toothpaste! \n7.

"We came here on Labor Day at 12am and waited for 2 hours. The waitress said it would take 3 hours but we still didn't mind. There were about 10 parties ahead of us. Also, I didn't know this place was actually a BAR. It's surrounded by the slot machines and there are no tables. So everyone is sitting at the bar facing the cook and waitress.\n\nOyster (half dozen) - $12. So fresh! They shuck the oysters to order and I saw them throw away oysters that aren't Oyster Bar approved. So it's nice to see that they care about the quality of their food. We were debating on getting the dozen since it was only $6 more. I regret not getting the dozen.\n\nCombo Pan Roast - $23. My husband and I shared and it was a perfect portion for us. The cook gave us 2 bowls of rice and didn't charge a split plate fee, which we thought they would. I think they just gave us less rice each. The shrimp was so great. It was not overcooked and just the way I liked it...a bit undercooked. The crab was shredded in the sauce which I don't prefer but it was still good and the lobster were in chunks.\n\nService - Our waitress was so kind and fast! I forgot her name but she kept moving and serving everyone. I also saw the cook go around the bar to clean the table. I thought that was cool since you don't ever see that! Definitely a team oriented restaurant. The cook also joked around with us that they ran out of oysters.\n\nI'm from southern california and this reminded me of The Boiler in Chino Hills.

We came back at 3pm and that same FD agent was there and he didn't recognize us and had to ask for the name on the reservation repeatedly.\n\nRoom: 1 bedroom Penthouse Suite with pull out couch. We have 5 girls stay in this room and it worked out perfectly with 2 bathrooms, more than enough space for 5 girls to get ready. The Suite also comes with a small kitchen.\n\nPool: MGM pools were great, there are about 8 of them and you'll be sure to find one that has the right crowd for you.\n\nFood Court: there is a food court in the hotel and it's great that places are open at 2am after you get back from the club",254,3
The pizza is pretty good especially for the price and they serve a nice size too. My husband and I enjoy the thin crust; I would perfer it be a little more crispy but my husband thinks it's perfect as-is...just the right amount of cooked.\nThey have recently started mixing up the pizza selection by offering a monthly special which is pretty cool. All and all it's a good everyday pizza joint.,88,3
---------DINNER ONLY------\nKicked off a work event with my co-workers here. The food was good but it wasn't memorable. It's loud and a great place to get together with friends (typical Vegas place). It's inside the Cosmo hotel on the floor with all the other restaurants. All the restaurants seem to have waits but this one never does. It's an okay place but I'd probably try another restaurant before coming back here,97,2
"I've been in Vegas now for 9 months, and last night was my first trip to the Red Rock.  Went to help a friend celebrate his birthday, and was pleasantly surprised.   The food court is pretty big, with lots of choices (Rubios, Capriotti's, & Tropical Smoothie, just to name a few).  We chose some Bobbie Sammies and settled in for dinner.  YUM.\n\nWe decided to go and play B I N G O, and the room is awesome.  There is an enclosed smoking section (A +) and a really large, comfortable area with built in trash cans for your paper.  Although we didn't win, we had a great time.\n\nAfterwards, we decided to go bowling.  There was a pretty long wait so we decided to hang out int he bar area and play pool, drink, shoot darts and play shuffle board.  The bartenders took really good care of us and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  They didn't even mind when we broke out the cake and served it up.\n\nAll in all, a great experience.  I didn't get to see the whole casino, I didn't stay in a room, and I did drop $40 into a keno machine and didn't win, but I'm sure I'll go back soon.",288,3
"Normally I really enjoy coming to wingharts for a beer and burger. This visit just completely put me over the edge. \nWalked into the place with a guy up front telling me to sit where ever, which seems pretty normal.  After 10-12 mins of sitting there expecting the guy to come take my order, he never came.  A nice waitresses took notice and told the guy I need to be waited on, but 5 mins later ... the guys is still no show.   17-18 mins of sitting at the bar, no one even took my drink order or even gave me a menu.  Can't be that hard to figure out one of the three parties at the bar have not been served   And yes I knew the exact time, because I didn't have anything to do besides fiddling around on my phone the entire time.  \nStep up your game Wingharts!!!  It will be a Very VERY long time till I go back again and only because of the good beer selection and good food.\n\nShould you find yourself there, and potentially a different  person at the front, I am sure you will have a pleasant experience.",250,1
"I am a bad, bad person.  I discovered FEZ very shortly after moving here 3 years ago, and have never reviewed it.  But I promise you, I have made up for this  by recommending it to everyone I know.  Whenever anyone asks where's good to go, FEZ is my answer.\n\nEverything here is spot on.  My personal favorite is the Casablanca chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, but I adore the kibis, the rosemary fries, the burger, the salads, the soup, some lettuce wrap something that Thomas served us, the kisris, and the martinis, oh lord save me from the martinis.\n\nSadly, I have not stopped by for brunch, nor have I ever had any dessert.  But seeing as how there has not been one single thing that I've tried there that I didn't absolutely love, I'm sure they're wonderful, and I'll correct this injustice next time I go.\n\nThe ambience and decor are wonderful, service is good, prices are good.  FEZ has been my go-to spot since the first time I went, and I doubt that will ever change.  It's great for a nice date, it's perfect for a gaggle of girlfriends, and as I recently found out with Dave, it's even lovely for a lazy late lunch on a Sunday when you can't bring yourself to get dressed up.\n\nYay FEZ!!",314,4
"This resort is HUGE.  One of the nice things is  that even though people smoke in the casinos, you don't notice it.  They must have really good ventilation systems.  We checked in around 9pm, and the wait was about 15 minutes, but the line moved along pretty efficiently.  \n\nThe hotel room was HUGE.  It was awesome.  The room also had an option of the shade curtain or the dark curtain, which are both controlled by buttons on the wall.  Let me tell you, the dark curtain will completely black out the room and you will sleep for forever.  The bathroom is really large as well, but not too fancy.  The hotel also had wi-fi included with the $25/DAY resort fee.\n\nThe 4 pools and lazy river are pretty awesome, but fill quickly.  And if you go during the summer, there will be children EVERYWHERE, which is really annoying.  They do have 1 tiny adults only pool, but it's the farthest away from the resort.  The lazy river is great, but kind of dirty with leaves, and you have to pay for an inner tube, unless you want to rent a cabana for a ridiculous amount of money.  The prices of the pool drinks and food are ridiculous, however if you walk up to the bar yourself, you instantly get up to $5 off.  Just walk to Fat Tuesday on the 1st level by the parking garage and get a cheaper drink and take it with you.  \n\nOverall, great stay.  Just be prepared to walk A LOT.",340,3

"Overrated and over priced. My husband and I went to the Wicked Spoon on our recent trip to Las Vegas, because of the Yelp reviews. We were expecting it to be great. First of all, for the most part all of the food was cold. The selection was not the best for breakfast food which is what we were looking for more than lunch. I did have a scrambled egg dish that was disgusting. The first bite did not taste right, and I immediately ran to the restroom to dispose of it. I have not felt good since, and it's been 3 days. \n\nWe did not try other buffets, but would recommend doing so over eating at the Wicked Spoon. We will not be back on our next visit.",154,0
"Had dinner here a few nights ago. It was very busy but the hostess and our server Allie did a great job and were very attentive throughout the evening.

"i'd been coming to them for a year now, i went one day & the regular nancy they call her was sooo BEGGING & RUDE to me! she kept asking me to add services upon services which i didn't want, she then started speaking her language to other workers (very obvious she was complaining about me) i pay well & tip so im not understanding this sudden urge of adding MORE services, i felt VERY uncomfortable & let the owner know i'd probably NOT be coming back again!\n\nthis shop needs to be GRATEFUL to regular customers & NOT brow beat or downtalk the customer VERY BAD HORRIBLE business practice!!!! well they WON'T see my hard earned money anymore & i am VERY wealthy as well as budget and allow my wealth to grow! they need to improve customer service skills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",172,0
"The overall hotel is wonderful. I stayed here in Dec. The Lobby is beautiful, pool wonderful (however not heated) and hotel room was great. We had two double beds with a wonderful living room set up. Beautiful trendy decor. Plush bedding and linen, large flat screen TV, IPOD alarm clock, and all those wonderful little perks. \n\nThe bad. I'm sorry to say that the service is extremely poor. This is why my rating is so low. There where a total of 3 good employees, the housekeeper, a maintenance person, and one person in the Lobby. We where not told about the paid parking (however we where rebated our money for the parking), the people at the desk where not very friendly pretty snobbish, the bar that is not owned by the hotel closes at 10pm we where ignored repeatedly by all staff then told it was closed.  Next time we went and where able to get a drink our female bartender was extremly rude.\n\nI would stay there again if I got a discount and didn't have to deal with the staff, or better yet if they changed staff.",237,1
This was going to be a couple hour to do something. There is so much neat stuff here to see. We ended up staying the whole day until closing and still didn't gett to see verything. We are diffently going back. A great place to take vistors from out of town. Only price is a low parking fee for all day.,74,4
Waste of time and money. My wheels are still dirty. Inside was barely wiped down and can tell no cleaner was used just a dry towel that left lint EVERYWHERE. I should've known a good job couldn't have been done in the 6 minutes I was there.,58,0
"The store is great. Easy to get in and out. The Take Care Clinic is nice as well. The people that work it are very nice. The reason this location got a 3 is because it is ALWAYS super busy.  Their is always a long line to pick up prescriptions, both inside and in the drive thru. Sometimes you have wait over 30 minutes just to pick up ready prescriptions.",83,2
"I lived here my freshman year, and it definitely wasn't my favorite.  The rooms are big, so at first Bromley felt like a good deal.\n\nHowever, I quickly learned that the walls are thin (probably just two sheets of drywall), and you can hear *every* sound from the room next door.  Even on weeknights, students often yelled and ran through the halls at 3 or 4 am.  \n\nAs an engineer, I had 8:00 calculus most mornings.  So, I found it impossible to get much sleep, and I often found myself sleeping in friends' apartments, instead.\n\nIf your goal is to party constantly, this is your dorm.  If you're interested in getting some sleep, Bromley Hall is not your best bet.",170,1

"I originally went here because I had purchased a groupon for massage. I asked for someone who could do strong work similar to myofascial release. I have 2 previous back injuries and a more recent severe whiplash injury from a lovely 40+mph car accident. Love red light runners... don't you?\nBut I digress, I showed up to meet Jacquie who was quiet, professional and got right to work. We talked about my physical limitations and I was very clear to \""go hard or go home\"" and she delivered big time. My shoulders and traps that had been hunched for over a year, were dropped and in a neutral position finally. I woke up the next day expecting bruises to be honest. I was surprised to see no marks, just that good soreness from everything working its way out.  I met with Dr. Jake who gave me an adjustment and got my Mri, X-ray and medical records and have been coming here since. My insurance co-pay was decent but they adjusted it so that I could get the trigger point therapy as well as adjustment and therapy 2x weekly. This business has improved my life immensly. I am now taking half of what I used to for pain meds and it's only been 3 months! If you have legitimate health and pain issues I strongly reccomend giving Backfit a try. \nThe front desk staff is friendly with the customers, Dr. Jake is nice, quick and focused on longterm results. Working on multiple issues to aviod creating a temporary bandaid fix. I've also had great results with the trigger point injections from Dr. Jenny. My molibity is up thanks to physical therapy and the take home Denerol tool. It's a team approach to overall healthcare and it works perfectly.\nWhy pay 50 to see a specialist for the trigger point injections, 20 to see a chiro, then 10 for physical therapy? Here you get it all in one place, one appt and with my insurance it was only 30! My only suggestion is to book Jacquie in advance because she fills up usually 6 weeks out. She really is that good. I am beyond grateful I found this business.",461,4
"The negative reviews are spot on. My older sister took her car in because the brakes were grinding a little. Once they inspected the car she was told that they were surprised that she had made there without wrecking it. She was told that brakes, shocks, struts, etc would come to $1870! I told her to get a second opinion and found First Class Auto at Scottsdale and Oak. She was told that the brakes would be needing new pads and eventually new rear shocks, price about $450 but it could wait a few months. They laughed at the Midas bill, \""Yes that is what those guys do, especially if you're a woman\"".\nAvoid Midas unless you want to get victimized.",150,0
"I have lived here for almost two years and I have really enjoyed it! Bottom line this is a weekend party apartment....if you don't like that then don't move in here. One of the great things is that this complex is college grads and older, I have never met someone living here who was in college.  The property is very well maintained, however, I love that they have pest control come once a week and spray the entire complex! Only thing I have not loved about living here is the property management company changes constantly. Sometimes the office people are a pain in the butt. If your maintenance request is taking too long, go down to the office and nag them, then it will get done!  Other than that, if you like to go out and want to be walking distance to nearly every bar and restaurant in old town this place is great! If you chose to live here be prepared to have higher rent than you used to have in tempe or some other place, remember you are paying for location!",208,2
"Simple simple simple rental procedures. And great prices, too! Come here to rent a paddleboard, kayak, hydrobike, pedal boat, 18' electric surrey, or pontoon boat. Hello, fun! \n\nThis little rental shop is literally right on Tempe Town Lake, so it's the most convenient location ever. The kayaks, paddleboards, hydro-bikes, and pedal boats all run somewhere between $15 and $25 per hour, which is a killer price. An hour is plenty of time to go out for a rousing little water adventure!\n\nMy spectacular gal-pal and I opted for the 2 person kayak.... We put her in the back to \""steer\"" since she's a more experienced water-sport-er than I... she was even on a rowing team once!! I sat in the front and acted like I knew what I was doing.... but I didn't. It was fun anyway! Now you aren't supposed to get in the water and swim, and you probably don't want to anyway because yuck-o; but this doesn't stop water from getting onto you. Your rear-end will get wet in the kayak for sure.\n\nNext we tried the HYDRO-BIKES. The best invention ever! Riding a bike on water?! It was almost biblical... I felt quite stable and safe up out of the water. You'll never get wet on this thing unless someone rams into you. It's a bit hard to steer and control, but doesn't take long to get used to. Sooooooo fun.\n\nLastly we decided to paddleboard, which is something else I've never done. I stayed on my knees for a bit because I was honestly a bit horrified. I felt like I'd surely tumble into the water and embarrass everyone... plus, I was having a horrendous time trying to steer. No matter what I did, I just kept drifting further out to sea... For about 2 whole minutes I felt very dramatic and like I was probably lost forever. But then I got over it and stood up (easier to paddle for sure, duh), and rowed my way back home!\n\nA seriously fun time on Tempe Town Lake was had, and I thank Tempe Town Lake Boat Rentals for providing us with quality equipment, awesome service and staff (they held onto all of our belongings and even took several pictures of us being all sporty), and great prices. Woo!",514,4
"This is my third time at this Denny's over the last 20 years. Each time I have been here they are crazy busy, but the staff (which I'm sure has changed over the years) is still helpful and welcoming. \n\nFood is good to any Denny's standard. Our waitress was fabulous! We were seated in a fair amount of time considering the volume and our food arrived faster than I expected and was hot considering how packed they were. \n\nI will continue to pick them as a breakfast stop when I make another trip to Vegas!",121,3
"I got the Carolina Dog and swapped out the french fries for Sweet Potato Fries.  The dog was good, very messy but the pork had great flavor. I was extremely surprised at how small the portion of Sweet Potato fries was.  It was $2 more to change to the Sweet Potato fries and I literally got about 20 fries.  They were delicious but definitely not worth the extra cost.  We each got a sandwich and upgraded our sides, he got a shake and our total was $30!  It is decent food, and a quaint atmosphere outside but the prices leave much to be desired.",125,2

Not only were they trying to confirm that I had reviewed them, but they screwed my tea up again. \n      How can you screw up a simple order of Tea?  What I really hated is when the staff (she) was trying to tell me that \""Pure Green Tea\"" is the Zen, not the China Green Tip Tea....seriously?  I told her, \""no\""; the China Green is the only \""pure green\"" Starbucks offers....she told me \""no\"", you want the Zen. \n\n* The staff are obviously confused about their own product line.

"SUMMARY - Pretty average hotel, good location, the shops/restaurants are nice but the rooms are showing their age and the pool is YUK (Pool Scum!!).\n\nSHOPS/RESTAURANTS - Good, it had plenty of them at all different levels. The Bourbon lounge was fun with old rock videos and the guy with the twisted sister wig was funny and kept things going. Lavo looked nice but didn't actually get there. The Grand Lux was very nice as an easy, 24/7 place to go - breakfast, late snacks. Basically an always open cheesecake factory. \n\nROOMS -  were ok, just average. This is an all suite hotel so if you're a family it's nice to have the larger living area which you could have small kids sleep in etc. But they are showing their age. The first one we got was a smoking room (they offered it as an 'upgrade' because it had a view). It was smelly and very dusty - and the view was pretty ordinary - so if offered this as an 'upgrade' just refuse.  The next room actually had a better view and was clean, but still these are not modern rooms. Not bad though.\n\nPOOLS - HORRIBLE.  on the first day at 10.30am we noticed really bad pool scum all around the main pool at the sides.  Really bad, if you have a hot tub you may have seen it after too many people have been in there. Didn't get cleaned up all day. Complained to the manager. Just got a 'its been handled' response. On check out told the girl that we couldn't use the pool and she credited the resort fee, which was good (that raised this from a 2 to a 3 star).  Also note that all the pools are for kids, there's no adults only pool.  AND most of the pools are in shade until 1pm!!  So before that you have to cram into one of the two pools that get sun if you want to go.\n\nSo, don't want to be one of these people that complain and give the hotel a one star review because someone looked at them funny, but truly this is not a 5 star hotel IMHO.  It probably used to be, but it's aging, the pool areas are badly designed, the service is meh, and for the money there are better options, or else spend maybe $50 more and go to one of the newer places and have a really nice time.\n\nThis is ok for families with kids etc, and that's what you see at the hotel, but if you are between 25 to 55 and have seen better then you may be disappointed.",578,2
"Fairly decent selection... but the prices are only good whenever they decide to put something on sale.  Always double and triple check your receipt... I found they are notorious for having items not ring up correctly.  On a busy late afternoon, good luck on getting through the checkout lines.  Copps is definitely up on Woodmans though for atmosphere.",72,2
"Yet another great local restaurant brought into being by Joe Johnston (creator of Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's Real BBQ).  The place is built out of a revamped 1930's grocery store and is super cool inside!  They have a wood fire pizza oven (you'll see all this wood stacked outside on the patio -- adds to the cool ambience) and swanky espresso bar.  The bathrooms are pretty awesome too.\n\nMost all the food is amazing here.  The pizzas are really tasty, so much so that I never seem to have the self control to not order them and try something new.  If you're vegetarian or trying to eat more greens, try the veggie pizza -- made with local produce, whatever is freshly picked ends up as toppings!  Salads and sandwiches are also delicious.  And the dessert selection is always pretty great.  \n\nThe only negatives are that the place can get incredibly busy at peak hours, so come early or be prepared to wait.  Also, food (entree, drink, dessert, etc.) adds up quick and can get kinda pricey here.  Another bummer is that the waitstaff won't seat you if your whole party isn't present, which has been an issue/hassle in the past when a large table was needed for a birthday party or special event but all the guests had yet to arrive.  Other than that though, it's wonderful!\n\nCome here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal!",319,4

"This is a pub on Cockburn Street that I seem to end up in on a fairly regular basis for no apparent reason other than to get out of the rain. That said, it is a nice enough wee pub and the bar staff are cheery and friendly. There's always a buzzy and lively feel about the place, no matter if it's 12 noon or 12 midnight. The bar's got a good selection of whisky and real ales and the prices are fairly cheap given its central location. They dish up some pretty standard pub grub which won't break the bank, but unless I was about to faint from hunger I would probably go somewhere else to eat.",141,2

"Unfortunately, my friends and I weren't thrilled with our \""Serendipity\"" experience. A few of my friends spoke quite positively about the NY Serendipity location, so we thought we would give this one (located across from Caesars) a shot. \n\nWe first went to their outside service window, to purchase a sundae and a few margaritas. The person at the outside window was able to sell us a sundae, but we were informed we had to go inside to get our drinks. This made sense to me and was really no big deal at all. \n\nHowever, once I went inside, the bartender oddly pretended that the 2 for one (Margarita) coupon I had, wasn't good for this location. Since I had just picked them up from a girl (hired by serendipity to bring in customers) right in front of this location, that didn't make much sense to me. After I pushed the issue, he accepted them. I'm usually pretty easy going, but that just didn't sit well with me. \n\nAll in all, this location was sub-par and overpriced. The Margaritas were decent, but the ice-cream sundae was average, and the service was deceitful and poor.",263,1
"Written by Husband:I had a serious issue with them quoting me cash price in contrast with what they billed my insurance. My wife and I went in here just to get a doctors note for her absence at work . She received a five minute check up and the note was promptly typed up. we were in and out in 20 minutes. When we received our bill from our insurance we see that \"" Doctor's Express\"" billed our insurance company $289.00 for the same service they quoted us for cash as $99.00. I called and I was told It was our insurance company that billed themselves $289 and that they had nothing to do with it. I have never had to pay over $120 for any urgent care visit ,including having debris removed from my eye. This place is a HUGE RIP OFF! Unless you have a flat co-pay insurance plan don not use your insurance ,it will end up costing you more than you think.  I believe the doctors there charge $900 an hour .

"This is the third time that I have been to this library. While it appears nice and feels comfortable, it is not the place to go if you would like quiet.\n\nI am presently sitting on the second floor, on a 'love' seat, while typing this via my laptop. Let me just say that it is noisy. There are children downstairs, and their voices echo up here. It sounds like they are sitting right beside me. Every noise can be heard and seems somewhat amplified. In addition, people who enter here seem to forget what library etiquette is. Cell phones ring repeatedly, music plays on occasion; people text message and seem to overlook the fact that their phone is beeping with every press of the characters. \n\nPeople are having conversations at the tables; a few are quiet, but even fewer talk loudly and seem to forget that THIS IS A LIBRARY!!!\n\nSo, while it may be fun for some, IT IS NOT THE PLACE (CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF OF LIBRARY ETIQUETTE) FOR PEACE AND QUIET.\n\nRight now, a woman is allowing her two kids to roam around and they are talking loudly; one is calling for her, and she seems to be ignoring him.\n\nYou may get a total of 30 seconds of quiet; then, the voices get louder, noises interrupt the peacefulness.

Got to see all of the cars up close, see some drivers, go into the garage, etc.  I didn't pay for the tix, and am not sure how much it was...but it was awesome.\n\nThose cars are insane!  To be so close was a treat.  Then walking on pit row, walking on the track...that was a great experience.  The drivers are so nice, it is like they're nothing special!  Weird!  \n\nStood behind pit row during the race...those cars are fast and LOUD.  It gives so much more to the race - I'm not even a fan.  Glad I came though.",173,3
"Seriously? \n\nThree pesos is about what I would actually pay for a meal here.\nThis is not Mexican Food. This is not even American food categorized as Mexican food. This is pure crap.\n\nThe salsa came in 2 flavors: water and chunky water.\nShame on you. If you poured Food Lion brand salsa straight out of a jar it would taste better. Sorry guys, V8 is not technically salsa.\n\nOK I'm done..not even worth writing about my burrito which looked like a turd and tasted close to one.",120,0

"I had the roasted vegetable omelette, and my husband had the breakfast quesadilla. Both were really delicious.\nWe are vegetarians who are frequently disappointed either with the selection or the poor quality of the ingredients, but this was very good. Fresh ingredients, creative veg options. \nOur waitress was very accomidating to a change of sides and did an excellent job describing the Jarlsberg cheese which we had never tried.\nThe cafe itself is a very cute and inviting atmosphere.\n\nOnly complaint was that we waited about 40 minutes for our food. Though it was understandable, since it was Sunday brunch.\nThey did acknowledge our wait, and gave us extra sides for the trouble.",143,3
"Blech. The only reason they have two stars is because I'm not sure if their service is good or not!\n\nThe food is terrible. My company has used them for many events in the last three years, and Nibblers has never delivered quality food. Just today, we had \""barbecue\"" chicken sandwiches for our Memorial Day event. The barbecue sauce (if you can call it that) was vinegary, not sweet at all, and just plain bad. The side dish they provided was potato chips. Really?! How about some potato salad? The salad they provide is terrible; nothing but iceberg lettuce.\n\nI would probably never use this caterer if I owned my own business.",146,1
Stayed at the Wynn for 4 days and came here 4 days in a row. Don't know why my parents like this place so much. Maybe its convenient? I think its way too overpriced. \n\nAlso probably had the worst milk tea here. Boba was hard and the tea was watery.,65,1

"Utter garbage and one of the worst places I have ever dined at. It is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant/bar that it pretty difficult to find. Arrived at 6:50PM and there was one waitress/bartender and one cook.\n\nI was not greeted upon entry and ended up just sitting down. The waitress was either playing with her phone all night or talking to the gentleman at the bar, After given a menu, waitress did not come back for another 10 minutes. Ordered. Appetizer arrived and was not served plates so ate off the board. A Chipotle Chicken  panini took over 30 minutes to come out, with the wrong side order and a ton of onions and instead of correcting it - just took it because I was sick of waiting. The chocolate cake took 10 minutes to come out, it was pretty good - ended up having a hair in it. I was leaving and I was the one who said goodbye - the customer.\n\nDo not come here. Period.",217,0
"I came here with really high expectations. There were a lot of articles saying how it is an amazing place to eat. The dim sum experience is nothing like the asian experience and the variety is very limited (4 options). The pork belly bits were very tasty and they were the only ones we got. The ramen (chicken meatball) wasn't anything special either. The ambiance was very nice, but the food itself was very mediocre. Howeverrrrr, the dessert was really good. Something like dirt pudding dessert. That was very worth getting. If you are craving asian dim sum, don't bother coming here. If you are craving anything asian don't come here.",137,2
I remember trying this place a while back. The food was alright but they were renovating at the time so the space was cramped. I'm open to trying this place again because some of the items on the menu stood out but if you're feeling Mediterranean you should get the gyro plate from Haji Baba or the hummus/Greek fries from Phoenicia.,72,2
"Definitely not a place I would drive over 10 minutes to eat at, but with ingredients like seared albacore tuna*, grilled ribeye steak*, smoked gouda cheese*, and lemon herb aioli, this little salad & sandwich shop is a great choice for when you are in the area. And even though the atmosphere isn't as gourmet as it's menu it's ok, because neither is the price. I'll go back.\n*Item listed just to give a sampling of options. I didn't actually eat this, so if it's gross and you hate it, sorry.",126,2
"The 3 closest Pandas to my house have been very inconsistent, so we decided to give this location a try. It wasn't any better. The workers here do not listen. The guy in front of us was ordering in Spanish. The lady scooped in half chow mein, half fried rice. I guess that wasn't right because she scooped the fried rice back into the pan. That was still wrong because she then dumped the chow mein back into the pan and gave him all fried rice. Weird.\nSo then I ordered. Asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken. She scoops the fried rice onto the plate and then takes my boyfriend's order. Then she asks me what entree. Honey sesame chicken! Ugh. My boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything. Then I get up to the register. I ask for 2 small drinks. The cashier asks me what size. Small! She rings me up and hands me one cup. I asked for two! So we then had to pay for the second drink... We go to fill up our drinks and there is spillage all over the drink station.\nSat down to eat. The honey sesame chicken was cold. The orange chicken was barely warm. The teriyaki chicken? It was great! Delicious meat, yummy sauce. That was the winner. The fried rice was also good. At times it has been undercooked/crunchy, but they did a good job today. The Panda Passion tea is very good too. Went to get refills before we left and they had made a pathetic attempt to wipe the spill but it still wasn't clean. All in all, no reason to go out of our way to eat at this location because it's just as inconsistent as the others.",360,1

"I've been to Montana Meat Company a couple years ago and the food was good, so I decided to try their breakfast.  Advertised prices looked appealing.\n\nWalked in around 10:00 AM and wanted to sit at the bar and have some breakfast.  Two patrons at the bar and no bartender.  Five minutes later, still no bar tender.  I looked around and there was no one anywhere else except for two other guys across the bar.  There was only a loud hacking cough coming from the dining room area.  Non stop disgusting cough.\n\nThe place smelled like smoke.  Not just your normal Vegas bar smoke smell, it smelled like they were using a few hundred pound of Marlboros to cure a frigging ham.  Pretty thick vomit smell too.\n\nSeven minutes in, still no bartender or host, or waitress or anyone.\n\nI left.",192,0
"I think this may be the second time yelp as led me astray which is pretty good!  I totally disagree with you guys though, this is not 4 stars.  It would be 4 stars if this was a $25 a person place but this is a $50 a person place.\n\nAs others have stated the service is really poor.  I literally couldn't even get the waiter to look at me.  The selection was kind of small.  In my head I had imagined a Vegas buffet to be an expansive feast especially when you are paying so much but it wasn't that way at all.  I liked the food fine but my husband thought it was disguising and he barely nibbled at the plate.  They had a salad bar to the far right, followed by cheese, then they had an Italian section (pasta).  Probably the most disappointing part was the meat selection: fatty prime rib, fatty meatloaf, fatty sausage links, fatty brisket, and fatty waffled fried chicken.  I'm not even kidding!  They literally served the most fattening cuts of meat and took the one healthy option and fried it in waffle batter.  I think for this price they should have offered a roasted chicken or something of the sort.  After the meats they presented oil soaked cauliflower then Asian food, and finally shellfish.  The crab legs looked nice but buffet shellfish scared me so I didn't try them.\n\nThe most impressive part was the dessert area.  I really loved the beautifully entry looking back into the glass paneled pastry kitchen.  If you can get a seat looking into the pastry kitchen I recommend it.  They had a wonderful selection of the desserts.  I tried 4 of them and most of them were pretty good.  \n\nReally everything in Las Vegas is so expensive that looking back this probably is an okay deal but to me the quality just wasn't there.  I wouldn't go back.",410,2
"It's so disappointing to write a negative hotel review, especially one that you had good expectations for and were looking forward to for a one night getaway. From the beginning... The hotel and the parking garage were easy to find, (note: once you park, you must leave the parking garage and enter hotel from street.) We didn't receive any greeting whatsoever when we arrived...and I mean when we walked to the front desk. It felt like we were interrupting the conversation going on between staff. It didn't really bother us until after our minute long check in. The lady (who I noticed was wearing a manager tag) didn't look up at us once. But we had our keys and were up to our room. Apparently although the courtyard has an excellent location in downtown Charlotte, it only has a few floors. We were on the third. Room was dated, but still thematically \""Courtyard.\"" Unfortunately, a lot of small details made the place seem dirty and cheap. A few examples: no soap, trash or towels in the bathroom. There were a few in the sink area outside of the bathroom but just one soap so we had to move/share between the two areas. It's worth noting they also may want to consider getting soap holders for the sink area. (and yes there's still carpet in this area...) You have to leave the wet soap bar on the edge of the counter. There are no plugs to charge your phone by the night stands. The hotel information book was sticky/water smudged and we couldn't read half of it. The tv was so slow, no channel guide whatsoever and forget about an e-folio or menu. It left a lot to be desired and was far short of the average yet clean/efficient standard Courtyards Hotels stand for. I spoke to another overnight employee during our stay at one point and she was equally cold, unhelpful and made me so ready to get out of this hotel. 0 stars for service. I didn't get a chance to eat in the restaurant but the staff seemed really nice and like mentioned earlier, location of this hotel is fantastic. I literally couldn't think of any other reason for staying here when there are so many other great ones in the area.",462,0

"We stopped by as a party of 6 for a birthday dinner. The experience was interesting and sub-par. \n\nThe Food - Out of everything the food was probably the only thing that went right. Salmon was fresh, avocado was fresh, fish to rice ratio was good. Although there weren't too many signature rolls to chose from. Rolls had different names, but everything was pretty much the same, nothing special. \n\nRolls ordered\n\nRainbow Roll - Average \nSalmon Avocado - Generous with their salmon, avocado was fresh\nHouse Special Roll (forgot the name) - Wrapped in white seaweed, first time trying that. The roll had 3 types of fish on the inside hamachi, salmon, and tuna. Interesting roll, tasted great. \n\nPricing - Average pricing 8-13 per roll, again just wish they had more rolls to chose from. \n\nService - Service was interesting, our first waiter was clueless about our menu. Our second waiter forgot about a cup of tea we ordered with our entrees and appetizers. Along with that he even forgot about an order of appetizers. When the bill came we asked for split bills, that came back immediately. But then we were left in the corner we sat in, no one ever came to take our bills. After 10 minutes of attempting to get the attention of our server we just decided to go up to the cashier and pay ourselves. The cashier took about 10 minutes to finalize 5 bills. In total, we waited 20 minutes to pay and leave; horrible service. \n\nIn all \nService was horrible.\nSushi was fresh. \nReasonable pricing. \nNot enough variety of rolls\n\nProbably won't be back again.",373,2

I love the food and atmosphere of the parlor!  The servers are really friendly and provide great service even when they are busy.

"As a non-Southerner, or as as non-Charlotter, the Belk name doesn't really mean a lot to me. Or used to. Now it does, and with good reason. I love this department store--it has everything a male my age could ever want. I'm not a huge shopper, but I actually don't mind going to the mall when it means a trip here is in store. \n\nFor high-end gear, this place is great: great selection of Diesel jeans, Lacoste, those sort of brands. Check out their Vineyard Vines display too; it's pretty awesome. Lots of shoes options, as well as sportier stuff. Like I said, they offer everything you want. \n\nIt's got that heavy department store feel, obviously, but it's not the worst thing ever. A little overwhelming given the store's size and number of employees, but you can figure it out pretty quickly.",204,2
"Fresh sushi in Nevada? Yeah, its not just theory anymore. I visited \""I Love Sushi\"" because of its stellar ratings (and I was lost). I used to seeing 4 star reviews for places, but the reviews on Yelp were a whole other matter. When everyone is raving about specific sushi chefs, -BY NAME - you have to know something is great.\n\nI am so glad I tried this place. The little extra's are great. Hand towels, exceptional service. Even when you sit down, people all around you are talking to the chef by name. Crazy! I love it. \n\nEach roll was exceptional. I actually ordered 2 more than I could eat because I loved it so much. I am a pretty picky person when it comes to sushi, but each roll was better than the last. \n\nHands down one of the best sushi places in Vegas. Check it out.",191,4
"I eat from the Salad bar at the cityscape location several times a week. Every once in a while the tomatoes they put out are NOT fresh. Last week they were old and I couldn't get a hold of a manager during lunch rush to discuss.\n\nToday 12/17 I go in and again the tomatoes are NOT fresh. They have started to wrinkle and deteriorate. I ask the manager to change them out and all he did was look at the label and say, \"" they are dated 12/17, see they were cut this morning\"". I WAS NOT disputing when the tomatoes were cut, but the fact that they weren't fresh which he was oblivious to. He said  he would get some more from the kitchen and returned saying I would have to wait, they don't have any more cut. ??????Really.

"I hope I never have to go back there again. EVER!\n\nI'll start with my only positive point of the night: the waitress was good, polite, fast to serve us. I almost pitied her, having to deal with narrow alleys between rows of tables and no space what-so-ever to do her job in a huge reception room. Even if there was many waiters that helped each others to do the food service, the restaurant had just overbooked the place with so many groups in the same room.\n\nOtherwise, the food was very average (I took the seafood casserole), my veggies were saturated with olive oil and overcooked/burned. The chocolate cheesecake was stiff and not creamy at all. My husband took the langoustine (scampi) plate, and was very disappointed with the size of it for the price he had to pay.\n\nSince it was really crowded that night, it was very difficult to talk to our neighbors at our tables. Also, if you have toddlers: this is NOT a family restaurant. Your kids will get bored, and there's no room for them to play. You can't let them roam around the tables, because they'd get in the way of the waiters.\n\nOverall, a bad experience.",268,0
"Was there several times for lunch but never really convinced. Today they saw me for the last time. I wanted the Jerk Chicken sandwich with the special sauce: \""Now stop snickering, it's really good\"" says on the menu. But it was an awful mix of tastes (salty-cajun-cinnamon-bluechease) that collided in my mouth..I couldn't down it. They offered to replace it and I ordered another chicken sandwich which came very late (my buddy was done eating long ago) and I had a hard time to find the chicken (takes magnifier glasses to see it in the sandwich) and so I left hungry., grrrrh\n\nIn general the place is way overpriced for the food quality they offer.

"Maybe the only place that closes in Vegas, Todd English opens at 11am,  a miss for those in search of morning pub fare as an alternative to the traditional Vegas brunch options.\n\nRaw bar is very good, with the lobster cocktail hitting all the marks: fresh and abundant, served in the shell (full tail and claws!) with a homemade cocktail sauce.  The sliders were average, the frites were frozen (my life's biggest angst...); while my colleague had English fish and chips, while it was cod (yum!) it did not look hand dipped, and again with the frozen \""chips'...\n\nI asked for Guinness, and while the server (who was very attentive and friendly) never said anything, I know she was feeding me semi-stout from a local brewery. Why not just say so?  If I ask for Diet Coke, servers typically go out of their way to say \""We only have diet Pepsi...\""  but I digress.\n\nImpressive facility (hell, its Vegas...) but didn't have the requisite pubby feel to it. And $140 for lunch for two (3 pints each) is a bit rich.  Yeah, yeah, maybe I don't need 3 pints at lunch... save it.\n\nOh! and they have a hot dog on the menu for $18...wtf?",288,2
"My one star is for the turkey burger alone.  I wouldn't go back to dine here again, but I would order it to go, it was very good...but a little over priced.  Burger places shouldn't be pretentious in my opinion, and this place oozes that.",61,0

"Definitely not the best place in town to see a show, but I have so many fond memories of this place that I can't rightly give it a bad review.  Not the best setup and the drink tend to cost more than seems rational, but it is definitely an intimate venue that usually books a pretty good variety of music.  It seems, though, that they've gone a bit downhill as far as the booking of national acts goes. Actually, they don't seem too big on local acts either. I wonder what happened.

"Had I written this review before the remodel, it would have been an easy 4 stars.  Since the remodel, it's been a debacle.  \n\nFirst, the double drive through may be good for traffic control in this shopping center, but having both lines merge to one window is not always easily managed.  I've been to the window and been offered the wrong order, only to be given the right order, which turned out to be the wrong order anyway.  There is a difference between egg McMuffins and sausage McMuffins.  That difference is 70 calories and 10 grams of fat.  If they do that to me 50 times, I will gain an extra pound.\n\nAnd speaking of food, it's crappy half the time now.  Chicken is dry and chewy...except last time when I was asked to pull around and wait in front.  So much for drive thru.  Had great chicken that day.  Too bad they bagged the fries upon ordering, so they were cold by the time the chicken cooked.  And the fries often have that cold, old grease been sittin' way too long texture.\n\nAnd the employees?  They must have had 100% staff change upon reopening:\n\n\""May I take your order?\""\n\""Yes, I would like a 5-piece chicken strip order, a southern style chicken sandwich, a large order of fries, a small Coke, and a large Iced tea.\""\n\""So that's a large iced tea, and what else?\""\n\nRepeat, Every Single Time.",343,1

And let me tell you, the prime rib here is not only amazing, but huge! None of the meats are precut of course, and are not even cut in the kitcken in the back. The prime rib is cut right there in front of your eyes and onto a large plate where they also ask what kind of sides you want to accompany it as well.

"I have been under the weather and wanted soup. To Olive Garden we go! I was excited to see that they have the little tablets on the tables now so you can order drinks, appetizers, and pay on them too. Had some weird mishaps from the start.\nI ordered a peach tea and when our server brought it out, my friend noticed the glass was dirty. So our server said he'd bring me another one. When he came back, he accidentally brought a pink lemonade or something. So he went back again to get the correct drink. I was disappointed that there were no frozen peaches in the bottom... did they stop doing that? That was the best part, eating the peaches at the end. :( When I took a sip, it was almost warm and quite syrupy. Needed more ice. My friend gave me most of the ice cubes from his water. The server did come by and ask if we wanted more ice. I said yes, but he forgot to bring it... Oh well.\nI ordered the soup (minestrone) & breadsticks, no salad. We also ordered the risotto bites as an appetizer, which the server entered into the tablet for us (I would have rather done it myself). The girl at the table next to us was texting the whole time, with the sound on so we had to hear the stupid chime... The people who eat here are always so oblivious to others around them.\nMy soup and my friend's salad came out before the risotto bites. Considering the soup was my entree, I thought he would bring it out with my friend's entree. Guess not. The breadsticks were fresh and garlicky so that was good. And the risotto bites were yummy as usual. Breaded cheesy rice balls served with marinara. Genius! When I was getting low on my soup, our server asked if I'd like another bowl. I said yes, and he brought it out right away. Wasn't even done with the first one... Over eager server! Better than a neglectful one but still...\nMy first bite of the second bowl of soup was surprisingly salty! I was taken aback! It had to have been from a different pot than the first... it wasn't bad enough to send back, but it was noticeably salty. :( When a guy came by with a pitcher of peach tea, I still didn't see any peaches in there... We had a gift card and were able to pay with that on the kiosk. It even prints out your receipt, which is nice. We were going to do the survey, but it timed out without warning. Pfft! But our server brought us 6 Andes mints so that was appreciated. Rocky visit, but I know we'll be back.",566,1
"This place is ok. Nice little venue for sure, but it's expensive for tex-mex, the high table chairs upstairs are horrific. Seriously, i'd rather sit on a jagged boulder.\n\nOverall 3 stars, the venue is very nice, food decent...",59,2
"Don't let the pretty decor fool you. This place is mediocre compared to the other station buffets I've been too. First thing that I took notice of is the common sense of the staff people. have. The hostess seated us all the way in the back near the wall, but to get there I had to squeeze through other people's chairs with my baby's stroller, ram people in the foot, apologize and manuver through tables. All that and there were open tables up front? Stoopid! Secondly, some of the other restaurant patrons here are rude. They stare you down as you obtain your food or hover right behind you...gross. Next we have the eggs benedict setup, one of my favs! But wait, they've already topped it with the hollaindaise sauce? Yuck, so I get a mushy eggs benedict. When I returned to my table, I found an OJ waiting for me, which was great considering I had a plate full of food that would need to be washed down. Took a sip and blargh! It wasn't just sour, but it tasted nothing like OJ! It was like they mixed it with a secret ingredient that I couldn't even place...All in all, don't think I'd come back here, unless I had no choice.",277,2
"Lulu's is a dependable place to get decent asian food at a pretty cheap price. There's nothing fantastic about any single aspect of the place, but it's good enough and cheap enough to be a mainstay for the university populations.",50,3
"A visit to Portovino will remind you how easy it is to claim that you're something special, and how different it is to prove it.\n\nIf you've read my other reviews, you'll know I love my sushi grade tuna steaks. I enjoy going to a restaurant and trying their version, especially when the server tells me how good it is. \n\nPortovino's tuna steak, at $36, was actually 4 1.5\""x1.5\""x1\"" (approx.) cubes. Is that enough for a meal? Is that worth anywhere close to $36? Nah. Not even close. The pieces were nice, but the multi-coloured sesame seeds added nothing. In fact, they took away from the dish. I cut off the edges to eat them first (otherwise I would have starved) to leave just the tuna to finish my \""meal\"" - if you can call it that. The tuna was tasteless, which was an absolute shame. Surprisingly (and thankfully) the wasabi sauce that decorated the plate helped and was not as overpowering as I feared. The side mashed potatoes and vegetables (peppers and zucchini) were actually better prepared than the $36 fish. (shaking my head). Quite disappointing, especially considering that of the 5 of us at the table who ordered the tuna, no one was impressed - but that might be because I got the best looking tuna of all of them. One person got 5 pieces instead of my 4, but the 5th was a tiny, scrap end piece that should have been eaten by the chef instead of served.\n\nThe service was pleasant, thank you. \n\nThe minestrone soup was very tasty, and some in our party did enjoy their meals, despite various degrees of temperature accuracy. \n\nUnfortunately, one person ordered a $42 filet, medium rare. It was served well done (!!) with the rest of the dishes, and when she sent it back, it took 25 minutes (!!!!!) to come back rare, at best, but mostly raw. Unedible. \n\nWe joked at how pissed off Gordon Ramsay would have been, but the real joke is Portovino, but without the laughter. Pretentious and uninspired. I don't like these qualities in people, and I hate them in establishments that charge a fee for the \""privilege\"" of eating there. This visit was not my idea and I was not the host, and I guarantee I'll be choosing a different place when I do make the choice.\n\nIf I didn't reserve my 1-star ratings for those establishments that were shockingly bad, Portovino might qualify. However, kind Mark awards them 2 stars (but they are really small stars, and very expensive.)",591,1

And all for less than 30 bucks.  Suck it up.",97,3
"Yikes, it's fitting that this is a seafood spot, because this restaurant is a sinking ship.\n\nMy coworker was hungry and wanted some soup, so I agreed to go to lunch with her. We arrived at around 12:30 on a Tuesday, the parking lot was half full.\n\nWe were greeted right away, and shown to our booth. A friendly server greeted us and took our drink orders. Coming back with the drinks, the server (Allison, I think?) did a good job of explaining the menus, showing us the specials etc. The server provided a really good impression that things were going to be very good.\n\nMy friend and I ordered lunch, she ordered the salad/soup combo and I ordered the breaded shrimp lunch (way to branch out, I know...) Our server brought us some tasty rolls, and was quick to refill our drink glasses. After about 25 minutes, our server again came over to check on us, and it looked like she was surprised to see the absence of plates on our table. The server returned to our table with more rolls and told us it would be a few more minutes.\n\nMy friend commented that it had taken forever for our food to arrive, and I could not disagree with her. I could see a long delay if we ordered some intricate dish, which was complex and required time (calzones, etc) but soup is already made, salad is just lettuce and dressing, and my entire lunch required mere minutes in a deep fryer.\n\nAbout ten minutes later our lunches arrived, and we were both truly puzzled as to what could have possibly taken so long. The place was not full at all, so it wasn't that the kitchen got overwhelmed- I really don't know the disconnect.\n\nI do not blame the server for the kitchen having epic failures. I do wish she would have stopped by and acknowledged the issue. Tell me anything:\n\n\""Hey, the kitchen lost your order, they're making it now.\""\n\n\""Sorry, there was a knife accident in the kitchen, and they needed your order slip to stop the bleeding.\""\n\n\""Sorry, I got busy and forgot to put in your order.\""\n\n\""Hey, I am not sure what is going on, but it is odd that you don't have lunch still.\""\n\nANYTHING. Just communicate. Clearly there is an issue if we have been to lunch for nearly an hour and still do not have lunch.\n\nIronically (TRUE STORY ALERT), an elderly couple using a walker to get around was seated after us, and ate, paid, and left BEFORE we got our lunch. It reminded me of the movie Office Space, it was great. When it came time to pay the bill, we made it a point to tip 25%, we were pretty sure that if others had as slow a lunch as we did, diners would mistakingly ding the server, when it was a kitchen issue.\n\nIn conclusion, as we got to the parking lot my peer told me she would never return, and sadly I had to agree. It's a weird thing when you remove a restaurant from your future rotation, but it had to happen. It is not cool to take an hour and a half to have a 'quick lunch' mere minutes from the office.",705,0
"So this is really 3.5 stars but not quite for a few reasons...\n- if you are not at the airport they accept COINS only. $10 worth of coins\n- if it's the middle of winter, the driver may opt for a smoke break, while leaving the bus running, heat pumping, and door OPEN so said heat can escape and instead you can get awesome cigarette aromas...mmmmm\n- if you didn't have the exact COIN change, the driver may under her breath (and i'm speaking french the whole time) say to \""see her\"" at the terminal. no problemo. i did. asked her what to do, never had clarity. went inside to buy a ticket, she kinda disappeared.

"Nove will definitely take your breath away...\n\n   ...the view, the service, the ambiance, and most especially the price! It's very upscale to the point that if you ask for water, they won't give you a glass of tap water with lemon on it, they'll give you Fiji water and charge you 7 bucks for it! But I'm not complaining nor am I patronizing these high end bottled water. \n\nBack to Nove, the food however was aiight. The Fillet Mignon was juicy and cooked just right but there's no WoW-factor that says, \""This is how a $90 + steak should taste like!\"" Their Creme Brulee tasted like the ones at The Buffet at the Wynn, but its good for sharing so no problem. Presentation of the both food was excellent, very gourmet looking.\n\nAnother con is there are a lot of older people eating here, but then again we were here around 9 ish so it must be too early for my generation to be out(?!?). \n\nIt was a good experience to eat there. Everything was upscale, not just so much to the taste of the food, imo.",252,2
This place gets two star for the lack of motivation and want to wait on people. How does anyone enter a business and they turn up they nose and treat u like go away. They need lessons on home training and classes on how to treat customers and life lessons on how to treat they fellow man.\n The odd thing is all the people who work here are older they know better. I asked fifty time for help did I get it no. I was getting ready to leave when one lady decided she should at least see what I wanted. I spent 200 with her just to show the others what a little hard work can do. Will I return sadly yes the husband loves this location. Although I cant see for the life of me why,151,1
"If this is the only place you can find in Las Vegas to have dessert, then by all means, go for it. \n\nI'm not a tourist, but if I WAS one, I'd avoid this place like the over-priced, over-hyped, over-indulged place that it is. \n\nI just went in for the aforementioned over-hyped frozen hot chocolate. What everyone has failed so far to mention is that this is not frozen anything. This is a richly watered down chocolate malt. It doesn't qualify as malt because it would have to have body to be that. This is like cold hot chocolate. \n\nI asked the waitress where my FROZEN hot chocolate was and she looked at me like I was an alien and said 'do you know what frozen is?' I refrained from sarcasm and told her I was well aware of the term 'frozen' having lived in NYC for years. She said that I wouldn't be able to eat it if it were frozen. I held myself back, barely, from explaining ice cream's properties. Suffice it to say that this is a dessert that is a lot of money for a lot of nothing. \n\nMy guests and I also had the carrot cake which was divine, but it was still carrot cake and not worth the $11 price tag. We also had this very strange 'Forbidden Broadway Sundae.' I'll demystify it for you: it's chocolate ice cream with a LOT of whipped cream and a small slice of dark chocolate cake. For $11. You're welcome, I hope I've just saved you the money you would have spent on that. Buy me a drink when we meet, I promise your money's worth, which is more than I can say for this place. \n\nWhen I lived in NYC I always tried to tell my friends to stay away from the touristy areas, they are MADE to rip money from your hands with a paltry return. I give all Vegas tourists this same advice. There are much better places to indulge your sweet tooth than this scam.",444,1

We like the food and the location/building is super nice. So that's a good review. But if you plan on needing ketchup - like my son when ordering chicken tenders from the kid's menu - you need to bring your own. They didn't have any ketchup at the restaurant so I went across the parking lot to Basha's to buy some Heinz. It was a bummer that I got caught in line behind a guy who wasn't familiar with using his debit card so the process took a while. 3 stars for a restaurant that doesn't have ketchup. I think that's pretty amazing but clearly this condiment continues its decline in American culture.,140,2

"We moved to Beechview back in April and Casa Rasta was the restaurant we visited to celebrate when we got the keys to our new house. Our first visit there was amazing. So jaw-droppingly amazing that we have tried to go back to redeem all of our bad experiences and we keep leaving severely disappointed. While we hope the service and the food will improve, we are skeptical and have decided to take our support of local businesses elsewhere (particularly to El Milagro, on the other side of Beechview).\n\nOur past 5 visits we went they have been out of at least 2 items -- ironically, it would seem, they are always the items that I want to order. So disappointment #1.\n\nSince just prior to the opening of their East Liberty location, service has gone down the tubes. We often know more about the food than the servers, and we never have a visit to Casa Rasta last less than an hour -- even when our selections are easy, like tacos and burritos. It often takes at least 20 minutes for someone to come take our order, and then it often takes 30-40 minutes for our food to get out, even when the place is empty. When it's packed, be ready for a 2-hour visit. So, disappointment #2.\n\nAdditionally, the past handful of visits, at least one person in our party's food has been not just lukewarm, but cold. That being said, you feel like it's hardly worth complaining about because even when you send in complaints via email, you never get a response, and if you mention it there in the restaurant, you'd be waiting another 30 minutes just to get hot food when you've already likely waited for 45 minutes. So, disappointment #3.",378,0

"I had the pleasure of eating at Simon's twice during my Palms Place stay. Consistent with the rest of the Palms Place property, the atmosphere is ultra-modern hip. Bonus are the views of the pool, which depending on the time of day is entertainment in itself (lunch and a show)!!!!\n\nMy first experience was for breakfast as they opened at 8am, which meant very few others were in the restaurant (but we were still on East Coast time). I ordered three egg whites with chicken sausage and hash browns. Everything was exceptional: the eggs were fluffy, sausage (and bacon - I stole some of my husband's) was fab, and hash browns actually tasted like potatoes and were not weighed down by cooking oil which is the usual MO. Great coffee and cool music, accompanied by floor-to ceiling glass windows, couldn't ask for better. I must admit that the coffee was heavy-handed in terms of price: at 6$ a carafe, two carafes were as much as one entree. Come on, guys, it's just freakin' joe!!!\n\nSushi at Simon later that day was amazing. They have a limited menu in the early afternoon, but the sushi choices are extensive. A starter of zucchini and pretzel bread served with butter was a little odd, but both were yummy. The spicy tuna, yellowfin and salmon skin rolls were all fresh and delicious. \n\nA bonus of dining at Simon after 9am, esp. during lunch and after, is the view of the pool crowd. If you're into people-watching, this is a total destination. There was a melange of g-string clad beauties, middle-aged dudes in straw cowboy hats wearing banana hammocks, muscle guys, and vegas partiers of both genders having fun to pounding club music courtesy of their own DJ.",384,3

On our visit I ordered a raspberry martini (Sky infusion raspberry vodka laced with Baily's Irish Cream - 4.5 Sips out of 5) while my wife chose a lemon drop (3 Sips).   On the second round, it is a personal requirement, my wife ordered the raspberry while I achieved martini nirvana by ordering The Bullet (Tangueray Ten Gin, Sambucca Romana and lemon juice - 5 Sips and no sharing).  Looking forward to a return visit this spring.",168,3
"I used to come here at least once a week when I was still a broke college student-the line begins to form around the block for their half off menu far before 11pm. For the price point of half-off, it is well worth it food quality wise as well to wait until then (if possible) to eat. The mixed fries (sweet and regular) they served with their sandwiches were amazing and the twisted rolls the sandwiches came on were delicious as well. Reading some more recent reviews, however, it looks like both of these items are no longer at Fuel. They have an amazing draft list,lots of craft drafts. They use kitschy names for their entrees-similar to Shiloh or Harris Grill-so you will probably need to read descriptions but don't let that deter you. The pizzas were always my favorite (of course my bf in college worked at Fuel and on the pizza station no less so they were always made extra well for my table). The Smoking hen (bbq chicken pizza) or the flying buffalo (buffalo chicken) would be my recommendations. I used to order the sierra grilled chicken salad often and that was pretty good as well. I would not go out of my way to come here-especially since it's packed the majority of the time-but if you're in oakland and find your stomach grumbling, stop in for a bite and a beer (or two).",289,2

"Some douche at the bar who I am assuming is the manager or owner, refused to help us and began yelling at my mother!!

Have been here multiple times and always loved it- even took my friends from out of town here. The service is always extremely slow, but we have dealt with it. The amount of attitude and rudeness we received today was completely uncalled for. The douche even said 'I have a problem with you!' Excuse me??!

"My husband ordered my birthday cake at Freeds. We have never been to Freeds before so I just showed up to pick up my cake, guessing it wouldn't take long because it was a pick up. I ended up waiting 1 hr 15 min on a Sunday... I was so frustrated with my hungry 4 year old in tow. The cake was pretty but over priced. When the woman put my cake in the box the top was too high and she smooshed the icing flowers on top. She said sorry... That's it. That rubbed me the wrong way. Does she not box cakes all day? Shouldn't she know how to not ruin it? We were excited to taste the cake but when we did we were very disappointed. It's as if they completely forgot the sugar in the icing. My 4 year old didn't even eat it, that's how bad it was. The marble cake and chocolate filling was good but we all scooped out the insides and left all the beautiful flowers and frosting. After feeling like I wasted 40$ on unsweetened icing I called in and you know what that woman to me? \""If you already are it, there's nothing we can do. Plus everyone's taste buds are different\"" 3/4 of the cake is left... We didn't eat it all and icing that tastes like whipped and salted butter is NOT a taste bud issue. I've had buttercream... That is not buttercream that is whipped butter only. So all in all, I will never return.",323,0

I just moved from Henderson and wanted a close by place for a pedicure. Glad I called in an appointment because while the place is big they are understaffed. 2 other girls walked in behind me and had to wait 10 min for their appointment and had at least 2 people changing around to work on them \n\nThe hot towel massage is a joke. For 35 at my old place you got a hot stone massage too. I didn't like how this company didn t have a menu to choose your pedicure there was only one advertised and jello in the water didn't seem worth 45 for. \n\nI wanted a cute anchor on my toe. Had a design I thought was simplistic. He did the colors out of order and the design came out as a Pinterest fail in my opinion.  At least it was only 5 extra for the design. Also there are not a lot of colors to choose from. A lot of tier colors are the cheap ones that chip easily. \n\nThe main guy working on my was chatty but I couldn't understand him well.\n\nThe best thing was they showed the soccer game.\n\nI'll be trying other nail places up North before I just drive the 40 min to my old place,272,1

Big comfy seats, awesome decor! It's a little dark but I like the atmosphere, and Buddha beer bottle chandeliers!\n\nDrinks. They have this awesome menu and all the drinks are $8 and top shelf with a blend of some really interesting \""healthy\"" items like carrot juice or jasmine tea, honey, and egg whites! They are such a fun variety of drinks! You have to try The Moon Is Rising! It's served in what looks like the \""Drink Me\"" bottles and it's so good! My other favorite would definitely have to be the ___?__ Ritual. It's served in a tea cup with Rosemary and the presentation involves fire, how could it get any better? \n\nThey also had. $4 Carrot Margaritas with honey and some other shenanigans that was amazing! (So they have specials!)\n\nThere is no food at the joint, but there is a Mexican Food place 2 doors over that is great ;) \n\nAs far as service goes.. When busy they can be a bit slow, but they mean well. As far as the crowd, we didn't make any new friends which is odd for me, so I probably wouldn't go alone personally like I can with many local bars, but get a few friends together, pull up a chair and enjoy some fun drinks! (They also have beer and standard liquor options)\n\nI posted some pics if you look on my page!\n\nI give it 4.5 stars, what would make it better?? Some snacks? We would have stayed and kept drinking there had there been a little something to munch on... We ended up having 3 more rounds of drinks at the Mexican restaurant! :) \n\nBut overall...\nI can't wait to go back, I love this place!",510,4
"I have been here 3 times.  The big screen to watch sports on the back wall is faded and lacks color.  All the other TV's are decent. That's not why it gets 1 star.  The food!  Where do I start? This is a over-priced sports bar and the least expensive item on the menu (chips and salsa) are $6.00.  For the quality of food, the prices are way too high.  I am more than willingly to pay for these prices but the food is lacking appeal and often time I wonder if it comes out of the can.  The only special they had during the world cup was $3.00 Bloody Mary's.  It's not worth the price, lacks atmosphere, and poor quality food.",167,0
This place has a very retro feel. I love the big booths and the entrance is kinda cool(you walk through the kitchen). Great place for a martini for me and a huge steak for the man in my life. :),46,4
Would have been 5 stars if they had more stuff on the menu but what they do have was all really good! Had a few items off the menu,32,3
"I wish more people went to Papa J's. It has great food, a truly unique atmosphere, and Frank. Frank the bartender is one cool guy. I'll get to him later.\n\nFirst, the ambiance. Very old building, low lighting, dark wood... a bit \""dodgy,\"" really.\n\nIt could be that the headboard of Madame Dolly Cavanaugh hangs above the bar. Yes, Papa J's used to be brothel in Pittsburgh's industrial heyday. But that's not all the whimsy the restaurant has to offer. Clutch the pearls and phone Rick Sebak, because it's also rumored to be haunted! Frankly, this doesn't surprise me. If you poke around a bit you half expect the members of Mystery Inc. to be disappearing behind false walls. Jinkies.\n\nThe food is good, comforting, and plentiful. The wedding soup is tasty and perfect for taking the chill off you in the winter.  All entrees come with fresh italian bread with dippings and range from $10-$20. You can choose from several pastas with a variety of sauces and meats. Try the veal bolognese pasta, served with tomato cream sauce. Delicious! They regularly have several daily specials, one of which is usually seafood. \n\nNow to Frank. He's a friendly older gentleman with lots of stories to tell. Usually, I drink beer or wine.  But when I'm at Papa J's, I simply let Frank pick my drink. Just tell him what you're in the mood for; something dry, fruity, bitter, or strong... and he will whip up something tasty.  \n\nI highly recommend Papa J's. Go there on one of those nights when you want to go out to eat, but can't quite figure out where to go. You're tired of chains, not in the mood for bar food, and don't want to spend a lot of money. Head to Papa J's Centro. Frank will fix you up!",431,3
"Greasy bacon, ham dry and over cooked, eggs looked anemic, hash browns look like frozen ones you buy at store. \n\nLol@ anyone giving this 5 stars, 4 and 5's are the places you bring family and friends to, so you can wow them. \n\nCame here for breakfast and only a tiny bit better than Denny's",81,1
"I went there the other day and must I say, their rolls are delicious! I'm a sushi lover and this one is currently in my top 5. Their rice is the right consistency were it won't break apart and isn't too soggy or too dry. The roll i got was the Rainbow roll and the fish on top was delicious. The roll was well balanced. I also got sashimi. The sashimi was fresh even though it was already late into the night. It didn't have the fishy smell. I would've given a 4.5 star but the dessert Strawberry mochi didn't taste right to me! (You also can't do that) Other than that, i would give the sushi a 4.5 out of five!",161,3
"Very large assortment of food!!!\n\nTBH, I ate at ~ 5 different buffets including the ones at Bellagio, Casear's Palace, Aria, Treasure Island, Paris etc, and this one was one of my preferred.\n\nI especially LOVED their dessert fruit tarts!",64,3
"Let's start with an SAT-type question:\n\nScottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum.\n\na) Oakland A's\nb) Rickey Henderson\nc) Phoenix Municipal Stadium\nd) Yankee Stadium\n\nIf you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.\n\nMuch like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.\n\nWe always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  \n\nThere are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.\n\nThe people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.\n\nParking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot \""across the street\"" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.\n\nSo, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars.",629,2
We decided to come here since we thought it was right off the highway. We found out later it is more inland. It is close to the Ethel M chocolate factory just to give you an idea of where it is located. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Korean Chicken which came with white rice and macaroni salad. It is a huge serving that you can split into two to three meals. I ate all of the macaroni though because that doesn't keep well and it was too delicious to stop. Ross J's does a better macaroni than Baby Stacks. \n\nThe Spicy Korean Chicken was good but I thought it would be spicy I just felt a tinge of spice from it. I also ordered the green drink which is really sweet. It's like drinking juice from concentrate. If you don't have a super sweet tooth I would advise against it. \n\nIt was a good solid meal for a nice price!,192,2

"Really overpriced, 6 or 7$ for 4 gyozas made of beans. Took over an hour to be seated even with a reservation. Ran out of 2 of our dishes and didn't even bother to tell us. Took over 50 minutes to bring our food.",61,1

"this is the second time i've stayed at the Rio in ten years. We got there on a friday night at about 1am. When we got to the room, the beds were not made, towels on the floor, and drinks from the previous guests were on th bathroom counters. My wife called down to complain and they said they would send up housekeeping, but I thought an entirely different room was more appropriate so we went back to the front desk and requested and got a new room. The problem with a lot of mediocre establishments now is that there is no legitimate effort to make things right. The front desk person really acted as if giving us a dirty room and then changing it was no big deal. I guess this is why I probably will not go back, As I seem to get older I expect good if not great service all of the time. The oh, I'm sorry sir, here ya go kinda attitude really doesn't cut it anymore.",196,1
"Per the suggestion of a friend, we stopped at Cinco for dinner on a recent Sunday. I was surprised to see that the restaurant was almost full with only two tables open and several large parties with children. Cinco is very kid friendly. We started our meal with guacamole and salsa. I was a bit taken aback by the fact that you have to pay for chips and salsa. I always feel nickeled and dimed when I have to pay for bread or chips. The guac was extremely bland. It tasted like it onl contained two ingredients, avocado and a ridiculous amount of lime. I had about three bites and left the rest on the table. I then ordered the ciudad due mexico-seasoned pork topped with pineapple, onions, cilantro and salsa with a side of rice and beans. I opted for no onions and somehow ended up without salsa as well. Good thing we had some on the table. I thoroughly enjoyed their tortillas- soft and flaky- but the actual taco was not what I was expecting. The pork and the pineapple were mixed together in the sesoning. The only way I can explain this is that they mixture was prepared earlier in the day or possibly earlier in the week and was warmed up and placed in my tortillas. I understand that slow roasting takes time and am fully on board with the meat being prepared ahead of time. However, I felt that adding the pineapple to the mixture masked the taste of the pineapple. As I was biting the tao, I was unsure if the chunks I was gnawing on were of pork or pineapple. They both tasted the same. This dish could have been much better had they added the pinpple on top of the meat prior to serving. All in all, I do not think that I will head back to Cinco.",358,2
"I have to start by saying that Alex and Elena are great people. It is very rare that you find people these days that put people and quality of work first.\n\nIf you have any heating or cooling needs and want to make sure it gets done right the first time with people you can trust this is the business to go to, hands down.",73,4
"I'd probably give a place like this more points if they weren't so damn over priced and had a bit better execution. A fairly small tuna poke appetizer and 2 not that special rolls for over $30 without drinks really?\n\nThe poke was ok but not anything like a traditional poke and for some reason they add what seems to be spicy tuna sauce to the tuna first which i don't get and made it a bit too spicy for Sharon H. without mixing it with the rest of the dish. I liked it overall but not as poke which is a very specific taste to me this seemed to lack. \n\nThe Sunkissed roll was a good idea but needs better execution. I want avocado and salmon with each bite not on alternating pieces. Oh and premium avocado has good flavor and isn't bland. I did like the special sauce. A little less onion or maybe not raw onion might help too.\n\nThe anago tempura roll just misses the mark for me and was over priced for what it was as it was tempura eel with cucumber, mint and fried garlic. at $11 most places have an eel and cucmber roll for $5 and the little slivers of garlic and sprig of mint aren't worth an extra $6. Plus the thing was just too many conflicting flavors and the garlic was over cooked to being so hard it was like biting a piece of rock it actually hurt a bit and didn't feel natural.\n\nTo top this all off i just didn't feel the fish quality was up to par. The salmon especially didn't have the normal taste. I will give sushi places a pass when its cheap and not that high quality but when it's expensive and lacking its a problem. The salmon had a fishy taste and didn't have that normal salmon flavor which stood out the most.",387,1
"I'm a bit spoiled here, I must admit, because I have been to several top notch rodizios (Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, Boi na Braza and Nelore) - and Pampas really doesn't match up to those in food quality or variety of offerings.  I think if I had never been to a rodizio before I'd have been somewhat impressed, as the picanha was pretty decent and the seafood that came with the surf & turf was surprisingly decent.  But, most of the meat was a bit dry, except the picanha and the bacon wrapped chicken.  The ham was VERY salty.  The sausage was actually fairly overwhelming by itself, but probably would have been fine as small slices in an italian dish.\n\nThe salad bar had a decent amount of coated salad type dishes and standards but nothing I had was really exciting.  They serve the ubiquitous rodizio cheese bread as part of the salad bar instead of fresh at your table, and fried bananas instead of cinnamon plantains are on the bar as well.  \n\nOne thing I will give them top marks for is the service - our waiter was super nice and attentive, in fact there was a slight mixup (not their fault) that they handled very graciously.  I had booked my reservation for 11 but didn't realize the rodizio didn't start until 11:30.  We ordered a couple cokes and were going to wait, but my honey wanted to just leave and come back.  So when I offered to pay for the cokes and explained we'd come back later, our waiter said not to worry about it, but just come back and see him later.  So I tipped him pretty big for the cokes and then again when we came back on the full meal.\n\nI am giving them a 3 overall, though honestly anyone who has been to Fogo or TdB is likely to grade them far more harshly in comparison.  If you get a discount to come here via Tix4Tonight or Groupon it becomes a much better value for your money, but it's still not really the best example of rodizio by a long shot.",459,2
"I started out on a quest to find Madison's best fish fry and stumbled upon this place. One thing to know beforehand is they do not take reservations and they pack the place on Friday nights. Expect to wait a while. This is a nice little neighborhood bar on the east side of Madison that has a huge following. They offer several different types of fish for the Friday fish fry. Fried or Baked Cod, Perch, or Walleye. I went with the fried cod which was absolutely delicious. I couldn't turn down the garlic chili fries or their home made chili. Needless to say I could have used a wheel chair for the way out! It was by far one of the better fish fry joints to go to in town and I will for sure be back. My only complaint with the place was that they don't take reservations and they won't do carry out during lent (due to an overwhelming amount of business) but it's good to see a business that does so much business they have to turn some away.",210,3
"After a call with no answer and hung up on the second time, I was able to attempt to order food to go on the third time.

This was one of the worst mexican places i've ever been.  The service was beyond bad and the food wasn't much better.  Try Roberto's taco shop for 1/4th the price and 10000% better quality.  I feel sicker then when I eat at taco bell after eating at this place.,74,0
"I've shopped here for years and the selection has, over time, remained pretty good.\n\n I buy stuff here for $17 that isn't available new in Phoenix and that I would have to pay $90 for online. \n\nUsually, that makes it worth dealing with the legions of 20' something indie whoreskanks who frequent the place. \n\nI would say about 2/3rd's of the staff are friendly and helpful and the other 3rd suffer from \""I think I have a cooler job than I do\"" syndrome. \n\nOverall, not a bad place.",138,2

"The worst mani I've ever gotten.  \n\nThey kind of have a \""We're the best, we work at the best nail place in town!\"" vibe, but nooooooo, you don't.  It's only the fancy location.  The work was really poor.  This emperor isn't wearing any clothes.  \n\nPolish was lumpy, uneven and chipped quickly.  The nail tech (red hair, don't remember her name) dug the tool into the side of my pinkie so hard, it cut and bled.  \""That sometimes happens,\"" she said.  Huh???  No apology.   An older woman (looked like the owner) looked over when I winced in pain, but didn't say anything.  It seemed like she could tell the tech wasn't doing a very good job, but didn't want to say anything.  I got the sense that the tech just wanted to get \""the job done,\"" even though I was nice and friendly to her.  The rest of the techs working there didn't seem that friendly, either.  \n\nI felt confused because I was thinking this would be a treat, and it wasn't.  :(  The quality of the mani was so poor, I just took everything off after a couple of days.   \n\nThe quality of the pedi was much better and lasted, but I still just felt \""processed\"" (\""Yeah, here's a leg in front of me at my station again.\"").  I didn't feel like they cared about me as a person or my business.  \n\nI'm kicking myself for having given her a bigger tip than I should have.  But you know what it's like sometimes, you're in a daze because it was so bad and you just want to give the tip and get OUTTA there.    \n\nI won't go back.  From the reviews written here, looks like I'm not the only one.",433,0
"Am less thrilled with Bombay Grill than I have been over the last 7 years of take-out, dining in and buffet.  I give it a three, but my heart says that they deserve a two-star rating.\n\nBiggest reason is the cost.  For Indian food paying $8 - 10 for a simple curry is a lot and when you add additional rice, their portion for accompanying rice is skimpy, nan bread you are into a $20+ meal and then add a beverage, esp an Indian lager, you get a bill for a couple of nearly $60.\n\nOut take-out orders are at or over $100.  So we have cut down.\n\nThe lunch buffet is skimpy as well.  After the first rush of diners many of the courses offered are gone or near gone.  There is quite a wait and it takes a number of people asking for more to roust management and the kitchen to put it out.  And the selections are not much variety-wise and on the cheap end of their menu.\n\nThe buffet might be dollar-cheap, but you get what you pay for:  not so good.\n\nDining in, which we thought would be a nicer experience and better portions than take-out, turned out to just be the same niggardly fare.  \n\nThe tastes and quality of the goods appears to have remained consistently good, but we are disappointed at the prices, lackadaisical buffet and skimpy portions.",321,2
"I am the first happy camper to post a dinner review. Good news!! I think this will most likely become a nice restaurant to think of when in the neighborhood.\n\nI was there two weeks ago for a saturday dinner with my girlfriends. The set up is very cute ; fresh, cozy, classy yet not too fancy. The waiters are very kind and professional. I give service a straight 10 !!\n\nI must say, the lighting was a bit bright for a saturday evening dinner. I mean, the fact that we noticed how shiny and bright the room was means it probably could have been a bit smoother  - how about cute candles ?\n\nOK - let the fun part begin. FOOD (and drinks!) \n\nFirst off, awesome wines, starting at around 45-50$ per bottle, but fun stuff to enjoy and discover.\n\nAs per the food itself, all plates are pretty much appetizer sized meaning you get to try a few without feeling too full afterwards. Too bad I didn't take any pictures -  the presentations are pretty nice.\n\nI had the foie gras dumplings with lobster mushrooms and an asian broth. The broth was a tad too salty, but hey, whenever there's fois gras and mushroom, there's me happy. So that was yummy !!  My friends tried the octopus and enjoyed it very much as well.\n\nI followed with sweetbreads which were very good. Not that big as a plate as I mentioned earlier, yet very tasty. Plus, I had some extra room for cheese! \n\n\nThe best  part was the cheese part. The waiter presented me with the selection and I chose three different kinds to try. The highlights of this course, however, were all sides : O-M-G. The waiter served me honey directly from what seemed to be a piece of hive (?). That was sticky, melty and delicious ! The cheese platter also came with an amazing jelly and a fruit compote. Yum-my. My friends had deserts which seemed funky and interesting - one of them had a black sesame cake which was weird but good !! However, I was enjoying my cheese was too much to even pay attention to what was going on around me. \n\nAll in all, it was a really good night. I would really like to try the brunch, although I will probably wait for a special occasion  - it's a bit pricey I must admit. However, it's definitely worth the try. You should go !! :)",531,3
"So, I've eaten here a handful of times, none of them impressive.  This last visit on 9/11/10 prompted me to write.  We met family for lunch, had a nice booth by the window and were plagued with flies the whole meal.  We had to repeat our orders to the waitress (who did right them down the first time), and when the food came to the table, even though its bar food, the presentation was terrible.  The chicken breast used for my sandwich was cooked as-is... therefore \""squirted\"" out the far side of the bun because it hadn't been pounded to an even width (which seems like a no-brainer to me).  Toward the end of the meal, where everyone munches on the fries and visits, the waitress came along and took my plate from me as I was still eating, and asked, \""Are you done with this?\"" as she walked away.  Guess I was.  \n\nLater inquiries of other friends and acquaintences found that NOBODY we know likes the Come Back In for anything other than breakfast.  In fact, all we asked said, \""Don't bother going for anything but breakfast... It's the only good thing they serve.\""  Duly noted.",268,0

Asparagus was grilled, which was good, but a skimpy portion of those skinny things.  House salad was not so good because we ordered the balsamic vinaigrette dressing which was very heavy and powerful\n\nThey do not make their own dressings and it showed.\n\nBeer was good.

And the brightly lit ad all over to shoot machine guns.\n\nIt's a little dirty and the interior is a badly colored grungy sleepy color -- but I guess it's a quaint reminder of what the lower-end casinos are like. But as an airport -- fully functional, not many qualms. On a weekday, there were mostly older people and businessmen.\n\nFree fast wi-fi is definitely the high point. There are a lack of power plugs but there are a few Verizon sponsored booths with chairs and a row of plugs. Not bad.

"I had been coming to Downtown Chandler since it was pretty much just Brunchies and a weird thrift store, just after they had redone it, so I was really excited to see a non-chain brewpub open up there and made a mental note to go back. Over a year later, I finally made it, on the way up to Phoenix.\nI was put off at first by the place because they had a radio station blasting on their small sidewalk patio and remarked \""I hope it's not that loud inside.\"" It's not, although it's still kind of loud. But I really like the way that this place is set up. First, there's the double-sided bar, with the \""other\"" side in front of the San Marcos, behind retractable, auto repair style, garage doors. Not only that but, in homage to the building's history as a bank, there's a big safe door in front of a regular door which leads to the staff area. The brewing tanks are viewable through the glass behind the bar.\nAs mentioned before, the smoking thing sucks. People do sit at the other side of the bar and smoke, and it wafts in. It seems like that violates the \""Smoke Free Arizona\"" thing, but whatever.\nI have a ritual with brewpubs: ask for a sampler/tasting tray, get a glass of water and a food menu to look over. The problem that day was that I was not hungry in the least, and couldn't have eaten the food even if I had wanted to.\nAnd what a shame. I like burgers, but I really like interesting burgers, and that's what these guys do. The main thing that caught my eye was a burger consisting of lamb meat, stuffed with pistachios and chopped dates, among other things. Wow. Now that's an interesting burger, and I definitely plan on going back to try it soon.\nThe sampler had their five standards and their one seasonal which, in this case, was the Hazelnut Brown. The Hef and Golden were a little too weak for my tastes, although I was happy that the Golden was not the quintessential cop-out beer that brewpubs keep on tap for those who ask for Bud Light. There was also a stout, which I wasn't impressed by. I liked the low carbonation, but it wasn't thick and heavy enough for me. Plus the flavor wasn't that great, mostly malts and a coffee essence.\nThe hoppy beers are, I think, where they do their best. They have an IPA, which was my favorite, but the hoppiest one on tap is the red. It was good, and I would drink a pint, but the IPA had a really, really nice flavor, so I got a pint of that.\nThe pints, mind you, are in special 18oz glasses. They're $4.75 normally, but go to $3.75 for their happy hours. The IPA was served nice and cold, which was a plus since the samplers were a bit warm.\nThe bartenders were super-nice and the servers seemed to be as well. The food seemed to come out quickly.\nThe other downside is that the place is a bit loud. Concrete floors, high ceilings, having those open doors and a bunch of TVs overhead make the place a bit too noisy. Definitely not an intimate dinner kind of place.\nAlso, I wasn't excited about their happy hour specials. They take about $1 off a lot of the food items, and the beer is only $1 off, but, considering that you're getting an 18oz draft beer for $4, that is a good deal. And they do reverse happy hours.\nIf you like brewpubs, then this is a really good one, maybe one of the better ones in the state when you factor in that food. So come for the beer, but save your appetite.",821,4
my girlfriends and i got on their guestlist so we were lucky for that because we didnt have to pay the cover. i would have been pretty pissed if i had to pay because i was not pleased. we went there on a friday night. it was PACKED. the dance floor was ridiculous. there was no room to move or to even get across. the only movement was people trying to get in and out of the dance floor. the music was good but we were sad we couldnt even dance to it because there was no room! drinks are expensive so preparty beforehand! haha we left and went club hopping to see what else we could find...,132,1
"wanted to check out xs for my last night but we were already having dinner at cosmo so my friend didnt want to go there.. lazyy..\n\nafter finishing up dinner at wicked spoon, the guys in our group went to get in line.. i went with my other friend up to the their room to grab the rest of the girls.. in the sea of people in line, i couldn't find the guys.. someone told us to get in the hotel guests line on the 3rd floor.. glad we did bc it only took 15min to get in, however, through that line you had to go up many flights of stairs to get inside =( when we found the guys we were told they had to wait in 1hr+ line on the 2nd floor/main entrance, oh too bad for them, if only they asked they would've found out they could've gone through the hotel guests line..\n\nthe stage, lights, visuals were as i expected but the dance floor was too small to my surprise.. the dj's (porter robinson and diplo) that night were good.. after dancing on the main floor for a little bit, i couldnt take that it was so crowded and spent most of the night in the outside area..bc no one was really dancing outside and didn't want to go through the main floor again for a spot to dance..i got bored and wanted to go back to our hotel.. my friend and i left and everyone had go down those many flights of stairs to exit.. not fun..\n\ni'd only go back to marquee nightclub for a good dj i knew was going to be there.. i wouldn't mind checking out the dayclub sometime though..\n\n----------\nquick update:\ncame here again on my next trip and had a good time.. we had dinner across the strip so we went straight here to get stamped for being on gl.. our promoter lead us and the other sea of girls up the escalator (never in my life have i seen an escalator and more filled w hot girls going up while the suckers aka guys were all on the escalator going down to pay for cover haha) we went to the line on the 3rd fl and line went by quickly..i cant believe we got in for free for kaskade!! (his '12 residency is amazing and was 3hrs, btw) anyway, we got our stamps and stayed for 30min before leaving while the opener was still on.. we came back in time for kaskade and the re-entry line wasn't bad at all.. i finally got the chance to check out xs the night before and honestly prefer it over marquee a tad bit..",559,2

"I was referred to this office a few weeks ago because of a squamous Cell growth on my head, under lots of RED hair.  Issac Gier, I tell him I have had basal cells removed in the past and point to my growth.  He Biopsy's it and walks out. (Yes, he really was in a bad mood)... No body check or anything, he says come back in 2 weeks. I asked if they carried Mederma for scars and he said that it was overpriced garbage that doesn't work...but recommended a 200.00 bottle of something they sell there. (I've had many surgeries and Mederma has always worked perfectly at reducing and minimizing all of my scars) ...Before the 2 weeks went by I get a call that I have Squamous cell and need Mohs surgery.  I go to my 2nd visit, he freezes a growth on my right hand and has me schedule surgery for the 7th of April.  Today.  So My husband takes today off work so he can be here for me, we get to their office at 8am. The girl tells me I need to pay for half today and half tomorrow.  I ask why.  She says, you'll come back tomorrow for sutures.  NO.  So I ask, does that mean she cuts on me today and sends me home with a hole in my head, and she sews me up tomorrow?  She said YES.  She said the doctor (Dr. Grace Kim) is too busy with all her surgeries to close everyone the same day of surgery. She said suturing up a patient takes over 30 minutes to do!!!  I said I want it all at the same time...the girl disappears and comes back with a big smile and says, the doctor said that you can make another appointment.  I got my lab results copy and left.  Seriously, what Doctor sends MOHS patients homes with gaping holes anywhere on their bodies?  Great way to double bill the insurance and patients.  \n#1) You should get a full body check at your first visit, ESPECIALLY if you say I am a cancer patient and have had growths removed in the past!!!!!\n#2) Don't accept going home with gaping holes.  So disrespectful!\n#3) 45 minute wait every visit....even today.\n#4) If the PA or Doctor is rushing you, or in a bad mood...leave. \n#5) if the front office guy cannot answer the simplest of questions...Leave\n\nThey make their money by charging you.  You pay to have insurance.  The least you should receive from this office is a smile and having a doctor who cares about each patient individually.  I did not get that from day one.  Now I have to start over...get a full body check and do things the correct way as it should have been done here to begin with. Shame on them. \nI am going back to Dr. Lionel Handler.  It's a longer drive but worth it.  At least he cares, and he does a great job.",658,0

"Here's another negative review of another shady local repair shop, and this is MY story!\n\nSo I broke my back a few weeks before I came here.  I wouldn't normally come here, the place just sounds shady, Purrfect Auto Service?  I don't even like cats!  But I knew the medical bills would be piling up so when I needed my smog check done $11.95 sounded like a pretty good deal.  In fact that's probably the cheapest in Vegas,  but like anything cheap you get what you pay for.\n\nFirst of all this \""smog check\"" took about 90 minutes.  That's what I said, 90 minutes.  I'm in a back brace and using an effing walker, do I look comfortable sitting here for 90 minutes?  Yeah I'm on painkillers but they're not working, this was supposed to be a 15 minute thing.  How on earth could this take 90 minutes?  Well, like the great guys at Ted Weins they decided to comb my car for crap that didn't need to be replaced.  When they finally finished the guy came up with this laundry list of items that I needed to have done.  Had I opted for these stellar services the bill would have been over $500.  Really?  $500?  It's a '91 MX-6, I paid $600 for that P.O.S. car  why on earth would I want to spend $500 on it?  One of the items that was recommended for replacement was the fuel filter.  Hmmm that's funny because I had just put a new one in a few weeks earlier, it was they ONLY part in the entire engine bay that wasn't covered in dirt and oil.  What a load of garbage.\n\nDo not go here, these people suck!",415,0
"So we had been driving by the Purple Penguin for the last three weeks and there has been a bunch of people waiting for their Snow cones.  So my wife and kids thought we would give it a try. We order four snow cones and we go a couple of different flavors and then the wait started, 25 minutes  and $21 later we got our cones and it was just marginal at best.  The Berry and Pomegranate seemed very sweet with no flavor.   While we were waiting they have a the Penguin Stand, with a donation drop off, with a water purifier, air pump and two  vacuums for the carwash and let's not forget the 12 gas pumps.   We saw a kid walking for the store to the Penguin almost get hit by a car, the driver didn't get chance to see them because the kid just darted out without looking!  There is way too much traffic in that parking lot and way too much STUFF!  For the price, not worth it, nor worth the wait!",214,0
"I'm mainly reviewing this place because I really don't think it deserves a measly 3-star rating.\n\nMy friend booked this hotel for Labor Day weekend, and after looking at the reviews, I was really disappointed that we didn't get a nicer hotel. When we pulled up to the place, I couldn't understand what these reviews were talking about. Some things worth noting:\n\n+ VERY close to the strip without being on the actual strip. I don't understand why people keep saying that there's \""nothing in the area.\""\n+ Very friendly staff. I got to be on a first-name basis with the bartender at the pool.\n+ Free happy hour nightly from 5:30-6:30. I like free booze and food.\n+ The pool is open until 3am, quiet, and has a jacuzzi - three things that are very hard to find on the strip.\n+ Room was clean, beds were VERY comfortable, and linens were clean.\n+ Maid service was prompt.\n\n- The Suede restaurant is kinda overpriced. The eggs benedict in the buffet were overcooked. Meh. BUT this hotel is a block away from Ellis Island, which is my new favorite cheap eats restaurant EVER. Review coming soon.\n- The lobby was really really perfumy. I'm sensitive to scent, so it didn't fare very well with my hangover on Sunday morning.\n\nAt first, I really wanted the \""Vegas Experience\"" this weekend, but I ended up really enjoying the chill atmosphere. I'd definitely stay again.",337,3
"Wooooo chicken fingahs!\n\nPretty legit place for fingers and fries. There used to be a Chicken Bonz over on Sunset in Green Valley, but it has since become Chicken Shack, and Chicken Bonz was reborn right of the 215 on Decatur.\n\nThis place serves up reallllllly bomb chicken fingers, with a bunch of sauces that will satisfy even the pickiest of chicken connoisseurs. They also have regular bone in wings, and burgers (I don't know why I guess some people don't want chicken?).\n\nIts a pretty interesting place, there are a couple of arcade machines set-up which definitely earns the place points because it takes a while to get the food sometimes. It seems to be a mom n pop kind of place so they do go the extra mile to make sure you are happy. Unlike Chicken Shack, there isn't a extra charge for a side of ranch which for me is a huge pet peeve. \n\nIf your in this part of town and craving good chicken stop by! Its worth it.",225,4
"Went for drinks in the lounge on a Sat.  They had advertised dancing, but there wasn't any-just a DJ playing house.  The place is barely lit.  It really is like the Haunted House at Disneyland.  Not just the lounge, but the lobby too!  You really have to see ti to believe it.  Only criticism: the ventilation is poor and there is a continual cloud of smoke in the place.  Complimentary valet parking.",96,3
"Terrible.  This is a true story.  I go to Zipps to meet up with my husband and our friend who are partaking the waitress finally comes over I ask her what is in her Zipps-a-Rita and she said, \""We pour it out of the frozen machine, then if you want to add extra alcohol you can.\"" Not my thing.  Instead I asked her if she had a lighter margarita with less sugar, I finally just ordered limes, club soda and tequila (a Nor Cal Margarita).  She looked at me and said, \""That's disgusting.\"" No joke.\n\nDude - I don't want all the processed sugar that comes out of your shitty frozen drink! And I shouldn't have to justify my drink order to the waitress.  Now when I get a light margarita at any other bar it comes in a 16 oz glass.  This came in a high ball glass. This was a drink not a mixed shot.  \n\nShe did come over and apologize, as I was leaving.  Looking around at the time I was there it was filled mostly with people over 50, the bar was 75% men.\n\nMy husband and his friend were over charged for their burgers but they did not complain because they got good prices on their beers.  I am sure that soon the novelty will be gone and they will raise a stink about being over charged on food.\n\nBottom line - if you want to hang out with old men and bitchy waitresses, Zipps is your place, but its not for me.",333,0

"Great for vegetarians!  Good for Thai food fans.  Mango Thai is not very pretty.  It is in a strip mall and the inside is plain and empty.  The food, on the other hand, was very tasty and plentiful.  They have many veggie options on the menu, as well as a large all-veg menu.  I had panang curry tofu and was quite pleased.  They got the spice absolutely perfect.  The meal came with a vegetarian eggroll and a vegetable soup.  I enjoyed both.\n\nIt wasn't the best Thai restaurant I've been to, but it was good and the price was right.  I would advise Mango Thai to drastically decrease the offerings.  There was way too much on the menu for me to go through.\n\nI will be back.",171,2
"The ladies and I came here for some bachelorette celebrating on Saturday night at 11:30pm. A coworker of ours put us on the guest list, so not sure how hard/expensive that would have been to get in. I was a little put off at first by the crowd... wasn't expecting an older, 40ish type crowd, and the area seemed small since there were a few private tables/sections that took up half the space. The view from the balcony was amazing, but too cold for us to stay out there to hang out. Claudeen worked her charm and we were able to walk around and get a tour of the back/VIP rooms thanks also to our boy Ralph. During the tour, we proceeded to meet some friendly brothers and their friends that just wanted to dance and have fun. So of course, we obliged and had a great time... lots of hilarious pictures ensued. We also randomly met Dean Roland from Collective Soul, nice guy and his friends were funny and just enjoying themselves. Unfortunately, I'm not a social butterfly, so I couldn't keep up.\n\nThe other nice thing was that the place was carpeted, so wearing heels all night wasn't as painful with the padding. Music was okay, we usually prefer hip hop, but we had a great time either way and got to request a few songs. Most of the guys we met that night were super nice and gentlemenly. I noticed though it seemed like there were more guys than girls. And at least it didn't feel like they were staring. Luckily also, our bachelorette didn't get too weirded out with all the crazy stuff we made her do with them. =P We even had a few cuties help us pick our club for the next night too. Too bad they didn't join us, though. ;)",382,3
"Despite being one of the best buffets I have been to and especially in Vegas, there was not too many things for vegetarians although some would say what they have will suffice.  For the price?  Unless you want a lot of dessert, I suggest only go if your meat eating friends want a buffet.  They do have options for us veggie.  If you're a vegan, I would not suggest this place.  There is hardly anything for vegans outside of steam rice or salad.\n\nHere's the thing, if you ask your waiter to help you with vegetarian items, they will actually ask one of the chef to give you a private tour explaining all the food items you could eat.  Funny enough the chef pushed a few seafood items at me, so be aware of that.  I am guessing some of these chefs still think vegetarian means fish and other seafood as well.  Maybe if you go and you are a vegan, they can point things out for you too.  From my tour though, most of the stuff included dairy or eggs.\n\nWould I go back?  Yes.  Only if my friends really want to go.  Will I go back if it was my choice and my choice alone?  Nah.  I rather spend money at a place with more veggie options.\n\nThe best thing: the macaroni and cheese bar!  I got all the veggie with extra jalapenos.  Too bad I cannot eat too much of that cause it was heavy cream and cheese based, but dang was it good!",320,2

"What a great morning we had. We decided to support a friend and her new adventure at MTO cafe. When we arrived we were greeted in the most friendly manner. The staff here is amazing, our waitress was very friendly and her food knowledge was tremendous. There were five of us so we decided to try many dishes. Started of course by the ladies having bottomless mimosas. Food, yes we had food. I had the 3 egg with meat breakfast. The meat was as follows. Bacon, turkey sausage, turkey bacon, AND spam. That is right I said AND not OR. I guess AND is better. The other folks atheist table ordered many more blends of food. I will start with \""The fat Elvis\"". A French toast sandwich with bananas, Nutella and bacon. This was very tasty and very rich in flavor a salty, sweet. Masterpiece. Harry's Berries, waffles with this delightful mix of Berries on the top, the waffle was light and was not too filling. Lemon poppy seed pancakes also with a fruit medley on top and a fruit compote drizzled over the top. Light and flavorful mix, the lemon not too overpowering. Chicken in a waffle, chicken fried chicken inside a waffle sandwich covered in chicken gravy. Chicken was moist, and the waffle light and airy. The gravy on top was definitely home made and filled with flavor. Smoked salmon omelet. This omelet has pieces of salmon and cream cheese soaked into the middle. Eggs were fluffy and the smokey flavor of the salmon with the combination of the cream cheese was like lochs and cream cheese in an egg dish. Amazing. What is a meal without desert. Yes we had desert, recommended by one of the owners. Forgive me for forgetting his name. We had Mini Donuts and Fried Apple Ring. The donuts were coated in powdered sugar and drizzled in honey grown over the hump in Pahrump. Very tasty, but over powered by the fact we still had the fried apple rings. These fried apple rings were awesome. A cut Granny Smith deep fried and served with a cinnamon sugar sauce that we could not get enough of.\n  We will be back to this new Gem of downtown. The staff was very attentive, our drinks were never empty. Always a plus with me. The menu is simple one page of choices. They are open for breakfast and lunch. We cannot wait to try the burgers and wraps. Some breakfast items can be had as a wrap as well.\n  Please check this out you will not be disappointed.",512,4
"Meh. I've experienced better. Ain't that the truth! \n\nStale chips and super oniony guacamole? Even at $3, I should have passed. The order took so long to arrive that I almost cancelled it, and MAN do I wish I had... The only saving grace was the salsa - it was generic but still pretty tasty. The drink specials during happy hour weren't a bad price, but apparently there was some sort of dispute about the happy hour prices being misprinted on the fliers that were all over the bar. The bartendress honored the prices but kept exclaiming that they weren't correct. WHO CARES, LADY?? JUST GIVE ME MY BEER! AND FOR $3!!! The patron to my left asked if she could have a happy hour martini for $4 and the bartender went on a spiel about how the price is in actuality $5, plus a $2 extra alcohol charge for the second type of liquor, so that the martini would actually be $7. Or $9. I was thinking \""that is NOT a happy hour martini!\"" until I realized that in real life (in non-happy hour time) a martini at this place ran twice as much. Sheesh, and no thanks.",258,1

"I've been wanting to come to Marche' for a long, long time. You won't ever run into this restaurant unless you go into the Desert Shores housing community so it's a hidden gem that some people may not even know is there. I did, because I tried unsuccessfully to buy a house here and got outbid at every corner.\n\nAngela H. put on a Sunday brunch UYE and we had prime patio seating for it. If it's nice out - take advantage of it! It's a shaded patio over looking the lake and has vines and potted plants giving a feel of being in someones lovely yard. It was busy, but not crowded in feeling and was a pleasant vibe for all of us to converse. \n\nI came late, but they were able to get my food out to me in a jiffy and our server was very pleasant. I had the buckwheat crepes with mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was pleasant and creamy and had to be sopped up with some bread, chicken was cooked right and I like the mushrooms were a mix of beech and oyster. The salad with it was a nice mix of greens with a hint of orange in the vinaigrette. \n\nI don't know why I haven't gone here sooner, but probably because my ego is bruised that I don't get to walk her from my backyard to brunch at the lake.

"I REALLY wanted this place to be good, I was a regular at Outside Inn and I've been waiting for this place to open back up.  My girlfriend and I have been here 4 times and the visits have gotten worse every time. \n\nThe first time we came was for breakfast one morning and it was excellent.  The only thing I disliked was the Mac and Cheese small plate ($6 or $7) was maybe 3 bites. It was advertised as small plate so I can't really complain and has since been moved off the small plate menu so maybe its a little big bigger now.  The hashbrowns were excellent and the bacon and toast tasted great. The girlfriend ordered the strip steak sandwich and said it was fantastic.\n\nThe second time we came here, the eggs were runny and the hashbrowns were not nearly as good before but still decent, can't expect the same cook to work every day. The problem we had was with the waitress.  She brought out eggs we didn't order but we said its fine, we'll eat them. When the check came, the eggs were on there which was expected, but so were an extra order of hash browns which we didn't order nor receive.  It took a few minutes to explain to her that hash browns CAME with our order and she was double charging us.\n\nThe third time was late on a saturday night.  Eggs were runny again and the hash browns were terrible and tasted like burnt french fries. \n\nOn the fourth visit it was for dinner so we decided to venture towards real food instead of the steadily declining breakfast food.  I ordered the Philly Steak Sandwich ($11ish) and she ordered some sort of salmon dish (I think it was $19).  My Philly was the 2nd worst one I've ever eaten (coincidentally the worst is right behind it at Prima Pizza), and I've had Cheese Steaks from easily over 100 restaurants and bars. Her $19 salmon plate came out and she commented that it was the tiniest salmon shes ever seen.  I told her its probably really good then for the price, she took two bites and didn't want to eat it anymore because it was burnt and oversalted.  I had to force her to finish it so it didn't go to waste.\n\nEvery time we come she orders the deviled eggs and loves them.  I would recommend only going here if its before noon and only getting breakfast and just expect the eggs to be runny and you'll be happy with your visit.",544,1

"A nice hotel to check into if you wanted to stay away from the noise from the casinos because there are none located in Vdara. You can easily get lost trying to get to the Vdara so prepare to study a map and drive carefully in the multiple circles before finally reaching your destination and drop off to mandatory valet. There is no direct walkway to Vdara so know the tram system and the multiple paths to get in and out of the hotel if you are planning to visit a friend or ultimately stay here. \n \nUpon checking in, you might as well have your key card on display at all times, because they will not let you in the elevators without inspecting it. The elevator was fast but felt sketchy at times. \n\nFriend was stoked for the automatic blinds that can also black out the room for those who sleep in during the day. A full kitchen with a mini-fridge, stove, oven, microwave, and a table for 4 is provided for those willing to make their own meals. Standing shower with a separated (raised?) tub with a toilet and sink completes the bathroom next to the kitchen. There is no real night stand so we used one of the tables in the \""living\"" room as a night stand near an outlet. \n\nIt is a nice quiet clean hotel with the no smoking and no gambling, but it makes it inconvenient when you have the urge to quickly get out. This is something to consider when finding a place in Las Vegas.",307,3
A great Italian deli on par with the best Italian delis in the US. I  tried 6 or 7 dishes. I was thoroughly satisfied with how authentic and fresh the food was. This is a standout Italian eatery amongst a lot of competition in Scottsdale.,54,4
"I'm a fan only when I am in Vegas partying or visiting family. My family always go to Pho Kim Long, but finally they tried this place and it's so much better. The broth here is savory and not salty. My goodness they load your bowl with noodles and meat that I couldn't finish it, but it's worth what you spend. The only problem I have with this place is their service, their servers do not come around to fill up the waters..argh..I hate that especially, when it's hot and spicy with siracha.",119,3
Seriously?!??? How in the world do you get rid of the red pepper asiago chicken Cesar salad?!?! The whole reason i kept coming back... Now i wont be back unless zupas brings it back!!!! You don't have a Cesar salad!!!!,52,0
"Absolutely the worst Popeyes franchise I've ever been to. Multi-leveled incompetence all across the board from the manager to the fry cooks. Several visits to this establishment (shame on me), have shown that they either don't care about filling the order correctly or they are too incompetent to do so.  Ask for mild they give you spicy, ask for spicy chicken they give you a wrap. Not to mention the one time I used my credit card instead of cash(which I rarely do), and my card number is compromised. I'm over this place and I've expressed my concern to their corporate office. Franchise stores like this one will tarnish the image of the company.",142,0
"For being the closest to one to my house not bad.  I've gotten my eyebrows done by the owner Vivian and she did an awesome job.  She trained one of her employees and she sucks so I go to another place to get them done I don't recommend it for eyebrows...\n\nFor NAILS well I have had a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE experience there getting fake nails.  One of the guys did them and within a week they started falling off!!! I was so angry I didn't go back for months!!! My friend is a huge fan of that place for pedicures and I only recommend it for pedicures, for manicures or fake nails go somewhere else.",144,2
I'm a guy and I hate shopping. But this location playa the 80's. Made the time go by cause I was jamming. Keep up the good work,37,4
"I want to start out my restaurant reviews - with my #1 pick to eat at in the Las Vegas Valley. The would be the Hash House a Go Go. The Hash House is located at four locations in the Las Vegas Valley. The first is at 6800 West Sahara Blvd. just East of Rainbow Blvd. The second is in the Imperial Palace Hotel & Casino located at 3535 Las Vegas Blvd S. The third location is in the M Resort and Casino located at 12300 Las Vegas Blvd. S in Henderson. And the newest is at the Plaza Hotel and Casino at the end of Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. They have a great menu for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Come dine for breakfast on a 'Roasted Chicken, garlic, onion, asparagus and Rosemary' Hash for only $12.95.\n\nOr dine on one of their famous one pound burgers like the 'Apple Smoked Bacon and Mashed Potato' burger also for only $12.95. No need for side dishes with this one, even though it comes with a ton of fries. (Prices are subject to change) How about for dinner you try one of their 'Sage Fried Chicken Linguine'. All of their food is great to eat and easy on the wallet.\n\nThey say that they serve \""Twisted Farm Food\"". I'm not sure if I would call it twisted, but it is some of the best I have had. Not only is the food some of the best, I have to say that the servers are some of the best as well. My beverage was never empty and when they asked if I needed something more I never felt as if I were being pressured. They truly wanted to help me. Even if they were just pretending, I could not see it. So, if you are looking for something unique and great tasting, get on down to one of the three locations of the Hash House a Go Go.",403,4
I love Gelato.  Gelato made from scratch is even better.  I got to try quite a few flavors and they were all amazing.\n\nFor those lactose intolerant.  There was like 15 different flavors of milk free gelato to chose from. YAY,58,4
"Can i just say, Awesome. Found this on Veebow on my smart phone. Downloaded the deal when I got there....Amazing Sushi. Was a Sakana fan, but this just burst to #1. They have to have the Best Happy Hour as well. I used there 25% coupon from Veebow, but I am now proud to say I am a regular here at the Sushi Room.",85,4
"I had the honor of hanging out with three lovely ladies after stopping at Filmbar for a happy hour. We were STARVING so I looked up restaurants close by and The Arrogant Butcher was agreed on by all parties. After wandering aimlessly for parking (damn you Phoenix Suns for having a game) I was able to secure a parking spot and sashayed on over for some eats. \n\nWe were greeted and seated immediately. The decor I must say is very different but nice. I was fascinated by their lamp shades. ( I know silly but hey I was) We started out with the crusty bread and olive oil however we had no plates, but we dug in anyway (an let me just say this was some damn good bread) Our waitress was like hmm would you guys like some plates for your bread? Hmm yes please ( ya think) lol  We all ordered something different from the sweet potato tortelli, yum, the turkey sloppy joe, which had a slight kick but not as spicy as you would think, fish and chips, and of course my dish which was black mussels with pommes frites. OMG! My dish was actually on the appetizer menu and let me just say I was in heaven when my dish arrived. It had the most mussels I have have ever had and the fries were just perfect. There were even bits of pork shoulder as well as cloves of garlic throughout the dish. Sweet baby jesus. Now mind you I was full, but I ate every last bit as it was not like I could take any left overs home. I liked it so much that I am contemplating going back ASAP just to have some more, so yes it was that good. A word to the wise, if you order a side of chicken let it be known that it will be a small portion for $4.00. A very small portion. (that is all)\n\nThe service was good, the company was freaking fabulous and the food was divine. They even validate parking (thank goodness) so it made it all the better. An all around win in my book.",425,3
"Went to this Best Buy with the intention of looking at, and maybe buying a kick ass audio system for Christmas. Not a single person could be found to help me, standing there for over an hour. The store wasn't even busy. I was in the Magnolia section and the regular audio section. I went to find help, but there was very little to be found. The few kids who were working didn't even seem to notice I was there, and walked right by me several times . Oh well, I guess this is one reason Best Buy is in trouble. I'm taking my $$$ elsewhere.",125,0
"Black Finn has become one of those staples in Uptown Charlotte now since it was one of the newer guys in the Epicentre. The restaurant/bar consists of 2 floors and both couldn't be any different than each other. On the weekends or during football games Black Finn will be very packed. On Friday and Saturday nights, it's almost impossible to walk around upstairs while the DJ is spinning hits. It also may be difficult to get a beer during this time, FYI. Downstairs isn't as crazy usually and there is no DJ. \n\nI heard they just changed their menu and that it is very tasty. I have only had little bites of food recently, so I can't tell ya more on their grub just yet. Overall, I think Black FInn is a place where most go to watch a football game or get a little sloshed on the weekends before heading to a club nearby. It is definitely a younger crowd on the weekends but older people tend to mingle here after work. I personally only go here if someone invites me who is already there. I don't make it a destination place... but it could be different for you.",240,2
"I actually really like this place. Alot of their stuff is greasy but if you aren't worried about dieting than this place is a good alternative to every other fast food joint out there. Their fries are really good. I love the great gobbler special. Never tried the cluckeetos, but i'll give that a try next time. Their chicken is also good to me. It's too bad they don't give free refills on drinks otherwise i'd give 5 stars. Greasy =great when it comes to this place.",115,3
30 years of Thai food in Vegas. This one is very close to home cooking. The only thing  missing is the original PUD PED PLA DUK(Crispy cat fish in curry sauce). The cooks could not give me the answer why it is not on the  menu but they will add it soon\n. Someone said they are thinking of  opening  2nd one. Archy's did  it  and let the original place dies(death and gone forever)). I hope they are not going down the same path.,110,3
"Finally got the chance to go to Hakkasan a couple months ago and have nothing but amazing things to say about my experience!  The line outside seemed organized to me, just a lot of upset people if they didn't get there way in VIP/Bottle Service trying to sneak in or bribe. We got right in, easy security and then got table service on the 5th floor. I wanted main stage, but after seeing our spot it actually was a great location and great view. \n\nI'll definitely be returning and thank you Hakkasan staff for making my night a great one!!",126,4
"The salsa was good. The fish tacos were kinda boring. Needs a zesty creamy sauce. Also, it was about 30% more expensive than it should have been. Service was iffy.",42,2
"I ate here with a couple of friends on Saturday.  I mistakenly got the lamb shank instead of the kebabs, but it must have been some good karma, because that lamb was some of most tender and tasty that I have ever had, in a delicious and rich sauce. \nMy friend raved equally about the baked eggplant. My other friend had the tortellini, and really liked it, although she'd had better at restaurants with a primary focus on Italian. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor was quite nice and the owners and staff very friendly. Pricing was reasonable. Since Oliva is close to my home on the West Side, I will definitely be coming here often!",146,3
"The hotel is set up to be really great, but it just falls flat. When I travel on business, I look for just a few things: free internet, a fitness center, and breakfast if possible. This place had all of the above and was in a good location so I was excited to get a pretty cheap rate through Egencia. But as soon as I got to my room the following happened:\n\n--Hallway smelled like smoke\n--Tried to plug in computer, 2 of 3 outlets did not work\n--Tried to call to get a wake up call, neither of the phones in my room worked - that's safe!\n--Upon not being able to get a wakeup call and not wanting to go downstairs at midnight, I tried to set the alarm...\n--...which did not work either.\n--There's free internet but the cable on the desk apparently charges you, and the wifi wasn't working very well.\n--Air conditioning was erratic and I was either sweating or freezing all night  despite it being set at the same temp all night.\n\nA few pros:\n--Continental breakfast was good, had what you would expect\n--Room was clean\n--Sleep number bed is nice\n--Convenient location (despite being across the street from Paradise Adult Store or whatever it's called... gross)\n\nIf I come back to PHX on biz I'll try somewhere else first.",304,1
"This place is a true treasure in Las Vegas for all you ethnic foodies who like to cook.  They pretty much carry any type of specialty cuisine you could want and have at least one full aisle dedicated to it.  They have produce and fish and meat as well.  We like to go here to get a few japanese foods that we really love and browse around to look at other things.  They have great deals on huge containers of spices in the indian section.  If you are looking for something to remind yourself of home, they just might have it here.",116,4

"We've stayed at the Rio numerous times of the years and feel that this hotel, which was at one time the only place we would stay in Vegas, is not longer the offering the type of hotel we would willingly stay in. \n\nSadly, after being a loyal customer for 10 years, I feel it is time to move on to a hotel that values it's loyal customers, maintains certain basic cleanliness standards, and does not nickle and dime you at every turn.  \n\nBye Rio, it was fun while it lasted.",117,1
"My family and I visited this location tonight because I wanted some sushi.We walk inside and there was no wait,we decided to not sit at one of the grills so they sat us in a corner 1/2 booth 1/2 table....i mean really in the corner totally away from anyone else! I felt like I was being punished or something, I opened the menu and was shocked by the prices,really over $10 for a kids meal? I wanted to get up and leave right away but I didnt....big mistake! Our waitress came over and I couldnt understand a thing she said,I just said iced tea! she came with our drinks and took our order,I ordered the filet mignon(which said it was comparable to kobe beef) and the hubby ordered the \""steak\"" ......ok it just said steak nothing else.the kids both ordered the steak as well,we also got a crunchy california roll and a volcano roll.our miso soup came out and was ok but ive had better,the \""salad\"" was iceberg lettuce with a half slice of tomato on top...not so good! the rolls came out and I liked mine which was the cali roll but they put a sauce on top which I didnt like,the volcano roll was soooo disgusting! hubby ordered it so im not sure exactly what was in it but it has cooked salmon wrapped around it,I ate one and almost threw up,it took all my strength not to.our food comes out,we all had the same exact food on our plates,\""steak\"" mixed veggies,and a mound of fried rice. the steak was cubed and tasteless,I tried both my hubbys steak and mine and couldnt tell the difference,no wonder they give you 2 different sauces....you will need them! The veggies included onions,carrots,broccoli and zucchini there was more seasoning on them than on the \""steak\"".The rice was by far the worst thing there,it didnt taste like fried rice and seriously didnt even taste like rice! I dont know what was going on there but whatever! my kids only ate the steak and some veggies they also hated the rice,my husband ate everything after took all of our sauces and pored it onto his plate.the bill came to $110 and I didnt even want to leave a tip but im not that horrible,I couldnt understand anything the waitress said,she hardly came over to our table since all of her other tables were on the other side of the room and she was busy with them most of the time.If I spend $30 for a plate I expect much more than what I got here and will never go back. At least dont cube our steak...I wonder what it looked like before they cooked it! I hope you see this before you try to go here,I made the mistake of not checking yelp before I went and learned my lesson!",589,0
"OK, I hate to be negative, but this place is missing its marketing \""sweet spot.\""  (Pun intended.)  This place needs to market itself as an after dinner LOUNGE!  The concept is outstanding, but I lose the enthusiasm of booze and ice cream (two of my favorite things!) when I walk in and it feels a bit like Grandma's house.  \n\nThe ice cream is absolutely outstanding though, really good flavor and texture.  The price is fair.  And the service was good.  I think I was speaking with Lee herself, who seemed a bit shy, but nice.\n\nI hope she does well; I'll be eager to follow her success.",147,3
It may just me but I think Red Robin has gone down hill. I used to love to get me a good burger at this location. Not so much anymore. Service was slow and fries were old and overcooked. Only reason I go there still is because my kids like it. But each time I go I get more and more against the idea of going there again.,76,1

"I stopped into this little East Plateau coffee shop a couple weeks ago. It was a decent little place. I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but if you live nearby give it a try. My coffee a great and the staff was friendly. I guess that's all we really need from a coffee shop isn't it.",72,2
"It was a dark and stormy night...  the monsoon was brewing and we had just got done with some BBQ.  I had found out about this place through Twitter and planned on getting some after dinner on a Thursday night.\n\nWe stopped in and were very warmly greeted.  We were given an overview of the ice cream and the flavors and tried the Oreo Mint and  Banana Cream.  Everything is made fresh on the premises, which may be why the ice cream was all a little soft, but you could really taste the freshness.\n\nI ended up with a scoop of the oreo mint in a cake cone.  It was very sweet and very minty, unlike many mint ice creams and yogurts.  According to my wife, the mint flavor was TOO strong, and I think I would have to agree.  I like the direction, but it was just a little overwhelming.  My wife had the vanilla and that was just about the best vanilla ice cream I've had in a long time!  My 2 1/2 year old daughter had the vanilla birthday cake; a flavor that reminds me of the Cold Stone cake batter flavor, but here it comes with the candy sprinkles, which is why my daughter picked it in the first place!\n\nThe single scoop was pretty generous portion.  The biggest thing I have to complain about was our cones.  Both of our cones were kind of stale/chewy instead of the  fresh and crisp that you expect from a wafer/cake cone.\n\nAnyway, hopefully they work that out for the next time we visit, because we will most likely be back.",338,3
"Not very good food, especially for the price walk a couple hundred feet and get something to go.",21,1

"I was so impressed with all the deliciousness that Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon offered!!! I loved everything that went into my mouth at this place--all the uniquely tasting foods and drinks sent my taste buds into a wild exotic splendor!    \nBeing a  vegetarian makes it challenging to find items that can satisfy besides the common veggies and salad... But WOW that corn on the cobb--I've never had corn that tasted so good--roasted with crumbled Mexican cheese and sprinkled with paprika...mmm mmm good! \nI also loved their guacamole with mandarin oranges, probably the best guacamole I've ever had in my life!!!\nThe Cheese Crisp... okay they warned me that this wasn't a typical cheese crisp-- it came out looking like a large orange crispy cheese cone!  With no tortilla!  Just cheese that was crisped w/ a side of delicious garlic aoli to dip it in!\nThe Manchego Salad--Very good... very different... very yum for a veggie head! The homemade ranch dressing was outstanding!\nThe Agua Fresca--Also outstanding!  I've never had water that tasted so good!  They told me they make different melon infused water fresh every day--what a treat!  I had the honeydew agua fresca and it was probably the most refreshing thing I've ever had!  I'm looking forward to trying the watermelon next!\n\nI will most definitely be back to Gallo Blanco Cafe in the very near future!  This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix right now! I've already been sending many people there!  Looking forward to trying the veggie tacos next! \n\nGallo Blanco had it all, awesome food, amazing staff and chill atmosphere...

"Hmmmm....i don't know what to rate this restaurant.  I  liked it, but it is damn expensive.  If fact, I came home hungry enough to eat the beef curry I made earlier.   In all fairness, I ate foie gras, which I get like never...it did go down like butter...so yes, I loved, but at $25...it does hurt a little.  I was still a bit hungry so I ordered a Nicoise salad..which really was a fishy mistake...oyy!  Trust me don't order it..dry, yet vinegary?  How can that be?  Well atleast the Champagne was good at $18/glass...yikes!\n\nLuckily I had a restaurant.com coupon, which cut our $100 bill virtually by a third.  Not going back, too many good local restaurant to try.   Bummer, but Foie gras...Yay!",197,2
"I really, really enjoy the double burger with bacon and raw jalapenos! This place is very close to my house so its convenient as well.\n\nI only gave 3 stars due to the high prices (when I go I only order a double cheese burger and it costs around 7 bucks). I only go when I am in the mood cause In-N-Out is right next door and I can get a meal for the same price as just a Burger at Five Guys. \n\nGreat food, bit overpriced.",111,2
"I 100% disagree with Shantel M. that there's something wrong with the plain tart frozen yogurt at City Girl. In fact, I think their plain tart is better than Cocomero, and possibly better than Pink Berry too. I strongly suggest sampling it before getting it if you're concerned, but neither I nor anyone else I know has complained about the plain tart tasting bad or 'rancid.' Perhaps this was a one time anomaly?\n\nIt does seem a tad short sighted of City Girl Yogurt to use 'girl' in the title. I'm all for girl only spaces but I'm not sure they're in a position to do so, considering they're competing with Cocomero which is already fairly well established in the Champaign Urbana area. I thought having to change the name would be a blessing, but unfortunately they didn't want to make a big change and I think it's going to hold them back.\n\nEdit: My bad on the fruit comment. I know for sure the strawberries are fresh, but haven't been in the shop for some time and may have made a mistake in my original post. I do stand by the 'girl' in the title thing even though, as Amanda Y points out, it's not meant to encourage a girl only space. Sorry Amanda, I've had to drive self conscious males all the way to Cocomero in spite of my very close to proximity to City Girl. = \\ Maybe now that it's City Girl rather than Skinni Girl fewer males will avoid it. I certainly hope so.",332,3
"Based strictly on the resort and room, I would have given this place more stars.  The rooms were nice and quite comfortable.  Although the bathroom did get soaked with every shower since there wasn't any sort of barrier to keep the water in.  \n\nThe reason I gave it fewer stars is because of the headache I am still experiencing several months later.  I had incorrect charges from someone else's spa package that were charged to my room, which I was told were taken care of twice after they made me swear I didn't go to the spa.  Uh, the person staying in that room was a 23 year old man who was with us the entire time, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't get manis/pedis and facials on the reg.  But, yes, everything was cleared up after a few phone calls.\nSecond, because of plane trouble we ended up not checking in until 6 in the morning, and we were told they would not charge us for those two rooms for the night before.  That was a lovely surprise!  Then they did.  I just wanted clarification, and after multiple phone calls, messages, and finally a terse message left with the GM, I finally was told the charges would fall off my card in February.  Guess what....  It's April.  Charges are still there.  I've left more messages... no return calls.\n\nSo, needless to say, I would recommend it, but double-triple check your bill and be prepared to argue.",324,1

Mouthwatering.  It was too gigantic for me to even think about finishing it.",96,4

"Went here for a late night sushi craving and ordered tuna,yellowtail and salmon sashimi,  red dragon, WTH, cherry blossom and the rattle snake rolls.  \n\nThe sashimi was good,  our yellowtail slices where small and thin compared the big thick cuts of salmon and tuna.  \n\nAll the rolls were very good,  slices could have been sliced a tad bit thinner,   all the cuts were about an inch thick.  Definitely not bit size pieces but it sure didn't fall apart.\n \nThe food overall I would have to give it a 4 star. \n\n The reason it got demoted to 3 stars is due to the fact that the bill came out with gratuity of $17 on a bill of $95 before tax.  I understand the need for yours automatic gratuity charge and it is usually used for parties of 6 or more...But it was only a party of 2!!!!",205,2

Me and the gents started first. When 2 ladies walked in, they started giggling and speaking in Chinese as we lie there  comfy on their bed. \n\nVery rude and unprofessional! The 2 ladies talked through the whole freaken session! Really?? They were so loud, the music in the background that was meant to make us relax was replaced with their giggles and loudness. \n\nAnd my girl...fu*k! Where so I start?! First she asked me if I was Chinese ? (Why? So you can talk smack?) She started out very gently...and then out of no where .... A vibration of a device happens to be near my head...yes! You fu*cken guessed it! A cell phone! Really!?!?! Are you kidding me?!?!\n\nAt times she paused to reply...who does that?!\n\nI was this close to chew her up, she was lucky that I was patience enough to let her slide the first few minutes. The massage gotten better and then at times I felt as if she dosed off. Since they close at midnight and we booked at 11pm (they must be tired and sleepy). Guess that's a tip for y'all to go early and not make the same mistake I did. \n\nOverall my experience with her isn't that bad. With the rude texting on the side, least she was quiet and did not join the other two to have a trio conversation.  \n\nOf course I was curious how'd the rest felt about this experience. \nOne enjoyed it, the other wanted the massage to be harder,(hence, he's pretty built, so I recommend that he should have gone with a guy next time for bigger and stronger hands). His girl was punching him most of the time.\n\nThat's an indication of, \""my hands are too small and your either fat or too built for me to massage you\"" technique. \n\nOne complained it was too rough (should have switch the two). \n\nMy wife...omg! Unlucky! She had a trainee! My wife said, \""I was there for one hour and my masseuse was being schooled for an hour by another masseuse and I did not feel a thing.

"Formally Coco's, now the Grand Cafe. \n\nI'm a few miles away from Boulder Station and came to have something to eat right quick. I didn't feel like anything else that was open in the area or cooking.

All the tables were set nicely, new paintings on the wall, and smiles on the employees faces. The service was very good. My drink was constantly full and I got my appetizer soup promptly after ordering. \n\nThe menu had reasonable prices and the food looked great. The Prime Rib Special looked very good, but that is until 11pm and it was already after midnight. Instead I went with a Bacon Cheeseburger with seasoned fries. The burger was a very good size and filling, I didn't even finish it! It came with thick cut bacon, slice of cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. The fries were hot and good. \n\nOverall, the food was basic and good. What stood out most was the service they provided. They are really putting in a good effort to make this place more customer friendly with excellent service. I will revisit and try the Prime Rib next time.",279,3
"Today was my first visit to Zoes and I enjoyed it! They definitely get 4 stars for the category they fall under (quick bites, cafes, affordable eats, etc).  They have a good variety and everything seemed to be relatively fresh!\n\nI tried the chicken roll-up and I really really liked it.  The chicken was tender, had good flavor and it was the perfect lunch portion.  The hummus was also very good and fresh.  The pita bread was not anything special but I can let that slide.\n\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, the price was right.  I'll be back!!",134,3

"Cox cable and Internet services may not be the best choice when you have options. \n\nThe company is large and they like to use that size to bully more than for improvement of service and services. \n\nI have been a loyal customer for many, many years and year after year my bills change without cause, they like to play up sell games, and even force you to take services you do not need, all in the name of savings. Don't be fooled as the savings are always temporary and in the end you always pay.\n\nThis company could be great, increase customer count and be the leader, but they choose to prey on unsuspecting customers, be overbearing in forcing staff to oversell and leave customers disheartened, and worse play the pricing games.\n\nThe people are good, the process is broken and inconsistent and the product is in demand. A simple fix could turn this company's rating the right direction, but only time will tell as technologies change who the winners and losers will ultimately be.",214,1
It's alright. The frozen chocolate is not worth $11. Tastes like chocolate milk and they put whip cream on it. Service is slow as hell. 2 stars.,39,1
"This place reminded me of a Chilli's restaurant and the giant TV's with sports on are really getting old. I just like to eat without distractions. The food was just plain, and the beer was good but not great. I take that back, the Czech Pilsner was great. The server was really good too. I probably won't go back but it wasn't horrible.",81,2
"We've been to Foodies Festivals before, but this was the first we'd been to at the EICC. Unfortunately, we went on Saturday, and it was beyond crowded and verging on dangerous. They should have allowed much more space between stands to reduce the crush, making grazing more pleasurable, and rendering it safe for pushchairs and wheelchairs. \n\nWhile there was little knew in terms of exhibitors, the quality was high and the samples good. The Extraordinary Sausage Company, in particular, was doing a roaring trade throughout the day, with some excellent produce; I recommend their sausages with Scotch Bonnet peppers. Unfortunately, the crowds they generated added to the crush. \n\nA good time, then, but disappointingly badly organised.",153,1

"I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the food, unfortunately it was plain and flavorless. I think that Roberto's would have been a better choice than this. The server was nice but you can tell he does not have that much experience as he was a bit clumsy and not very professional. The prices were pretty reasonable, I just wish it was better. \nMaybe it is a good spot for lunch but we probably won't be back for dinner.",96,2
The service was very good.  They feed you until you can't eat anymore.  The food was just OK though not great.  The banana pie for desert is a 12 out of 10.  It was awesome.  the creme Brule was horrible.,59,2
"The first time I went here, I was with my best friend. We went there for happy hour. We were told that happy hour is only at the bar. The bar area is inside the restaurant and  outside. The happy hour menu is only a page just one sided. Even though the selection is small the food is delicious. The plates are good enough to fill you up with just 2-3 plates.\n\nThe second time I went there I went with my boyfriend. We went on a thursday. Also went there for happy hour. When we sat down, I noticed a $5 martinis only on thursdays. \n\nThe price for the happy hour food is $3.95 for every single plate on the happy hour menu. \nThe service is good. But the first time I went there, it was ok. We had to ask our waitress to get refills on our water.",190,3
"Around a year ago I suffered two concurrent workout-related injuries that left me in extreme pain and unable to walk more than just a short distance.....a few months ago I finally got up the nerve to go see a chiropractor (which I'd never done before) and chose Dr. Llaca based on the reviews I read here.\n\nI am truly very impressed with her - not only has she helped me tremendously (I'm about 90% of the way back to my former pain-free self), but she also takes time during each visit to teach me something new that will help me to help myself.  \n\nAs others have said in their reviews, she really does have a wonderful - and knowledgable - holistic approach to wellness.....she's made good suggestions for my diet and supplement regimen as well as tips to help me sleep better. \n\nI highly recommend her to anyone who is dealing with pain or health issues related to pain or injuries....she really cares about helping you to get well again.",215,4
"If you go to the Olive Garden expecting to get an awesome Italian meal, you're gonna be VERY disappointed. If you go with low expectations (as weird as that might sound) it's really not that bad. \n\nEven though my parents can eat wherever they want, they willingly choose to eat at places like this, Red Lobster, Applebee's, etc., on a regular basis so when I was in town for Christmas we decided to come here for lunch the day I was leaving to go back to SF. When I lived in Scottsdale, however, I did come to this location on a few occasions with the parental units. \n\nI actually think there soups (there's about four to choose from), salad (nothing that will blow your mind, but does tastes fresh), and bread sticks (hot and fresh) are really good. I think they run some sort of special during the week where you can do all-you-can eat of these things for like 5 or 6 bucks. I would definitely take advantage of this if I lived close by, and these items and special alone is worthy of four stars. \n\nThe appetizers and entrees here are all pretty meh, however. There's nothing on the menu that's all that inspiring, but the food isn't all THAT bad. When I came here this last time I had portobello ravioli in some sort of cream sauce. The ravioli were overcooked IMO and the sauce was bland (my mom had manicotti, which had the same cream sauce). My dad decided just to get an appetizer sampler, and I tried a stuffed mushroom, and I will admit, Olive Garden or not that was a pretty good stuffed mushroom. \n\nOur server, Cara, was very attentive, but the place wasn't very crowded when we there. Still though, an uncrowded restaurant hasn't stopped some servers I've had over the years from providing crappy service. \n\nI probably wouldn't choose to come here, especially for dinner. However, the soup and salad is good enough where I wouldn't mind coming in for lunch every now and then. Plus, Kendra Wilkinson of \""The Girls Next Door\"" fame freakin' loves this place so it can't be that bad, right?",476,2
"One thing is for sure, you know what you're getting when you order Domino's Pizza.  I wouldn't say it's the best pizza by any stretch, but you know all that going into it.

"Alright so it was good... but was it $100 good? \n\nI loved the oysters. They were creamy, small, and lightly buttered. But were they best I ever had? Nah.\n\nThe kampachi was delicious also. It was the size of my business card though.\n\nThe foie gras burgers made me give foie gras a second chance. Wow, really rich and creamy!\n\nI had the Hanger Steak as an entree, probably the best Hanger Steak I've ever had. But at $50, I wouldn't have minded settling for something at Mon Ami.\n\nI finished with the White Chocolate Mousse with Chocolate Pearls. It reminded me alot of Mon Ami Gabi's. \n\nThe drinks were nice, but nothing special. I got the raspberry mojito which didn't have enough flavor and kick to it. The wine decent, but I paid $12-18 per glass!\n\nOverall, it was good but not worth the price tag. I would definitely return to the original Joel Robuchon for dinner maybe to give the prix fixe a shot. But I think L'Atelier was overpriced for what you get.",256,2
"This is one of the older Fry's in the Valley and I understand its going to be completely renovated in the near future. There's nothing really wrong with this store except it feels a bit dated, so I will be looking forward to the renovation.\n\nAs it currently stands, parking is convenient, the store has an excellent selection of merchandise, and the customer service is friendly and plentiful. \n\nOnce they renovate this store I have no doubt it will become another five-start Fry's location.",108,2
"I remember driving to Champaign from Kankakee to go to \""C street\"". It was worth the drive. \n\nThey have a large dance floor and 3 levels you can observe the dancefloor from. When it is warm, you can hang out on the patio as well. \n\nC street is where the boys are in Champaign.",74,3

"Oh, Eat--I really wanted to like you, especially after hearing such glowing recommendations from friends, but you just left too much to be desired.\n\nAs far as the good: the decor was really cute and reminded me of some farm-to-table eateries in Denver or Portland, and I really appreciated the variety of menu items, which included healthy options and vegetarian-friendly dishes. \n\nThe execution, however, desperately needed work. My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast on a weekday morning (meaning the place was busy but not slammed), and we ordered water and coffee upon our first interaction with the server. Neither came out until our food arrived. (And it should be noted that my breakfast didn't come out until my boyfriend was almost finished with his plate.) \n\nAs far as food quality, I was again disappointed. I love the idea of beignets, especially with jam and mascarpone, but they were pretty overcooked. My egg white frittata was so wet that I literally had a pool of water on my plate, which made my English muffins soggy and water-logged, and my boyfriend ordered the tofu scramble, which was flavorful but unbelievably greasy. \n\nI love the concept of this restaurant, and I think a lot of people want Eat to succeed, since it provides a sense of authenticity to the burgeoning neighborhood, but the actual execution needs some refinement before I could recommend it to anyone.",296,1
"Well finally Borders luck has run out. This location and 7  others in the valley are closing. Right now they are having a 20-40% sale on everything in the store....but let me advise you to wait because I am pretty sure a lot of what you want will be there in the coming weeks when they reduce the prices even more. Now with that being said let me give you this word of advice also just in case you didn't know.....I have been to tons of these \""Going out of Business\"" sales....in fact I look forward to them. However all these store are guilty of marking up the prices and then giving you half off...when the item was worth only the half off price anyway. \n\nExample you see that book that you want that for weeks, months....maybe a year would cost you 30 bucks....so naturally you figure if you get 20% off the book you would save yourself 7 bucks or so right. Well that is normally true but now all of sudden that book is 40 bucks and 20% off then sends it right back to the 30 dollar price you have been seeing it for all along.....and in fact with tax it will be a lot more than that. So just be careful and watch for that people but continue to Eat, Drink,and be Merry my Friends!!!",285,2
"Used to be a favorite place but has gone way down hill. Wife ordered beet salad which is one of her favorites. Came with bad blue cheese and wilted greens which ruined whole salad. Management offered to take $1.00 off for bad cheese which missed the point that the salad was ruined. I had 'Cowboy Sushi\"" and if i got more than an ounce of meat, I'd be amazed. Prices have gotten way out of line. The only saving grace is the outdoor seating area. My suggestion: bring a brown bag and enjoy the outdoor ambiance. Don't bother to order off the menu.",126,0

"We decided to try this place while in Vegas as I knew the NOBU in New York is the real deal. First of all, it was in a weird location inside the Hard Rock, hard to find at first. We were dressed up a bit for a nice dinner and were getting some stares as everyone in the lobby was super casual. We walked past the slot machines, drunk frat boy almost falling over us, and there, we finally found it. Decor was quite dated and not so impressive for its name. We had wine and sake flights and way too much of it before food but the sashimi is the thing to get here. It's not raw, seared lightly with some delicious sauce. Sushi was very fresh as well. Our waiter was very funny and knowledgeable. Overall, even though it was quite expensive, it was doable according to the Vegas standard and I would return here again so that I can say, \"" Can I have 10 plates of sashimi only please!\""",202,3
"It was an interesting night to say the least. \n\nWe were very fortunate to be able to push our reservation up by half an hour (reservations were set at 9:30).  The interior is gorgeous as well. \n\nAfter being seated, we witnessed a lady passing out next to the table next to us. It took a while before she was wheeled out of the restaurant. But the entire staff kept very calm as to not alarm the other guests. \n\nUnfortunately, an extremely loud group was seated ever so closely next to us. Close enough to where their chairs hit mine and the non stop yelling and drunkenness started to take a toll. \n\nDid I mention that our meal took over an hour to get to us?  First of all, they got one of our drink orders wrong (we only ordered 3).  Second, they told us about their amazing house made cheese and bread which took about 30-45 minutes to receive. They also forgot our appetizer and we were told that they were \""going to bring it out with our meal\"". Who wants an appetizer with their meal?  Finally, our meal comes after 10pm. Of course, we didn't get an update on our food until they brought it to the table, but did the complimented on ONE DRINK for a $500 meal. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food tasted absolutely incredible. The staff was very friendly as well. But, I'm still not quite sure if I would return. Bummer.",327,2
"After planning my trip to Vegas with my friends, I knew Earl of Sandwich was my first pit stop! I got the Montague sandwich, but my friend convinced me to try her Hawaiian sandwich. At first I didn't think there was anything special about it..but I was so wrong, the Hawaiian sandwich had the perfect balance between sweet and savory. Definitely a sandwich to try if you've already tried all the others. Always coming back to this hotspot.",93,4
"Very smoky! We came to try the brews ($2) and they were just OK, definitely not worth a special trip.  The heffeweizen, amber and IPA were served in plastic cups, and all of the beers were very monotone in flavor with little to distinguish them. All also had a slightly off aftertaste.  There were booths on the side of the casino to sit in. It was a Thursday so pizza was 1/2 priced, but it was just ok also.  Overall, very mediocre and while sitting in the 'nonsmoking' section for ~10minutes I started getting a head ache because the little casino had really poor ventilation.  I had to leave, and I definitely wouldn't recommend coming back.",153,1

"A must see.  The castle is gorgeous.  We got there as soon as it opened, with tickets that we had previously purchased online, so we walked right through all the extra lines.

The grounds are hilly, uneven cobblestone.",90,4
"Diva beauty is very modern and clean. It's located in a plaza next to Ulta and Old Navy. I love the artistic designs on the walls. I got an awesome Groupon deal and decided to try this place for the first time. There was no wait on a Thursday afternoon. \nSasha was great, my eyebrows looked amazing. It took only about 10-15 min for brows, upper lip & chin ( all included with a 10$ groupon).  great deal! would definitely go back!",110,3
"I came here because my friend had to pick up some furniture, I'm the person she knows with the largest vehicle. Lucky me.\n\nAs far as Walmart's go, this was about par. The clientele was mixed, the employees were fairly nice, and I only waited about 5 minutes to pay for my stuff. This is also one of the stores that has a McDonald's inside, which makes it really difficult for me to say no to my guilty pleasure of a vanilla cone! Also, they have quite a few of those \""self checkout\"" stands that are increasingly popular. I like that because it's usually a little bit quicker as long as the person in front of you is good about it. \n\nSometimes it's easy to attack this store because there's this idea of low-class people shopping here. I'm sure that might be the case at some stores, inclusive of higher-end ones, but I didn't get that vibe here. \n\nOne of the previous reviews seems to be really aggressive about the demographics of the people who shop there, work there, and dislike Walmart's business practices. While I agree that this business isn't the best towards their employees, I do strongly disagree with the attacks against the shoppers there. I never felt that this store was full of transients or anything like that, nor were purses being stolen, nor was there an unsafe feeling.",296,2
"Love love love this place! It's the go-to when my roommate and I have out-of-town guests or whenever we want non-Mexican food and alcohol for dinner on a Sunday night. (A surprisingly hard to find combination in Pittsburgh) The wait staff is always friendly and professional...they've let every group I've come with sample multiple beers and were very accommodating about special dietary needs or explaining the menu in greater depth. It's a good place to go with friends, as the pizzas are large enough to split and it's fun to get several of the delicious appetizers to share.",126,4

"Plain and simple, good cold beer, food is a rip off.  Asked for Chips and Queso, no salsa, paid full price for chips and salsa then was up charged $2.99 for a tiny / half full portion of cheese, thought it was small said something and was told they were losing money on normal portions, I still had 3/4 of chips left and was charged another $1.30 for the same 1/2 portion. So $2.99 + $2.99+ $1.30 for a 1/3 cup of Queso and chips, which I left most behind because of the aggravation. By the way my two beers were $5, makes no sense.  \nDavid",157,1

"This review is for the Salud Cooking School located on the 3rd floor inside Whole Foods Market. My wife & I signed up for the Tuscany themed class. Salud offers all kinds of cooking classes. Some are just demonstration, where you go & watch the chef prepare the food & then you get to eat it. Or you can do a hands on class, which is what we attended. Here, you get to jump right in & help prepare the food. The class consisted of 12 students, a few volunteers and the chef, oh, and plenty of wine!! We cooked some steaks, created a great lemon basil chicken dish, made pie dough for our berry tarts & also put together a handful of veggie pizzas. Of course after making the food, we all got to eat the food and it was delicious. As you may have guessed, everything we were eating was brought up from Whole Foods Market. We really had a great experience and got to take all the recipes home with us too. The cost is a little pricey ($130 for two) but it was worth it. Classes vary in price. We are looking forward to signing up for a few other classes in the future.",241,3
"I've been coming to SCC for four years now and have enjoyed all of it! Class sizes are decent, the teachers are good, the campus is very nice and it's incredibly affordable compared to a university. It has some cool things to offer, check out the Sonoran reptile cage or the CNUW if it's open. The campus is easy to navigate, not overly spread out but not cramped either and there is ample parking though you may have to walk a bit sometimes. They offer a plethora of transfer programs and off-site Northern Arizona University bachelor's degree programs.\n\nMy biggest downsides to the school have been some misleading advisers and how strict they can be on attendance. It's a little funny to think you can get kicked out of a class you voluntarily paid to attend, for choosing not to attend.\n\nOverall though SCC is a great place. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to complete pre-reqs or get back in school!",201,4
"We didn't expect much from this little plac e in the Venetian but it was 11:15am on a Monday, my husband and I wanted breakfast and no one else seemed to be serving it late.  We were pleasantly surprised with this small bistro. The service was great, the breakfast delicious - scrambled egg croissant sandwich, spinach & mozzarella egg white omelet -- and the coffee was excellent.  My husband also had a pecan tart he said was really good.  With so many excellent restaurants in Vegas, I'd be remiss to give anything more than a 3-stars but the place was not a disappointment.",131,2

"I ordered a dishwasher online and it was sent to this store so they could deliver it to my house. Apparently unlike the last dishwasher I got from Home Depot the delivery service from Lowes does not include them uninstalling the old unit and installing the new one and instead they just drop it off and take the old unit after you have disconnected it yourself. I could of dealt with this part but unfortunately my brand new almost $500 dishwasher did not come with a power cable yet they decided to take my old one and not say anything. My wife who was at home when they delivered this called me a few minutes after they left when she realized. I called Lowes to ask for my used cable back since the delivery guys were probably still in the area but after being transferred around a few times was given all sorts of attitude about how  should of known the new unit did not come with a cable and how the delivery guys could not come back due to there tight schedule. Some Lady named Alexis in the delivery dept told me \""I know that is what you would like to have happen but it's not possible because they are on a tight schedule\"" when I asked if they could bring it back that afternoon.

"As our \""cheap\"" dinner during our weekend in Vegas, the bill quickly skyrocketed when 8 out of 9 girls ordered the LARGE margaritas.  One each.  Each one equaled one large scorpion bowl.

I did enjoy the large salsa bar and the guac was excellent.  I ordered the taco salad and no surprises there.

"I am in total agreement with Lily A.  This was one of the worst meals we have ever had.  An article in the AZ Republic quoted the owner as saying that this \""food goes down pretty well with the university crowd.\""  God...I hope they spend their money on beer instead.  I think even grade school cafeterias don't serve this kind of dreck anymore. The fomerly frozen, poured-out-of-a-giant-bag fish was about 1/4\"" thick and tasteless.  They charge $1.55 for an extra piece.  It's worth maybe 50 cents if you happen to find 2 quarters in your car's ashtray.The small handful of fries was cold, limp and shriveled--maybe the owner can invest in a heat lamp with all the money he is saving on buying cheap, glorified fish sticks. And they charge extra for tartar sauce.  The meal came with 2 red mystery sauces that remained unopened and were dumped in the garbage.  How about giving the customer a choice of 1 sauce and not charging them for it?\nDecor was drab, tables were dirty and there was food stuck in the cushions of the booth along the wall. Yuk!!

After a few of us gave him a sharp look, he left.\n2) The four member cleanup crew walked into the room before the movie ended and just stood there looking at their phones and us like they were annoyed with us for not, i don't know, fast forwarding to the credits so they could start?\n3) The whole place seemed grimy and dated. My buddy wanted Twizzlers but Red Vines were the item on sale. Too cheap to buy premium concessions? In the Ballantyne area? This place must be getting crushed by the local competition.\n4) There was only 1 hand dryer in the men's room near theater 8... and it was at kids height.\n\nOn the upside, my Star Trek ticket was $9.50 which is $3.00 cheaper than my Iron Man 3 ticket at AMC Carolina Pavilion 22 on 5/12. \n\nNext time, I'll pay the extra $3.00.",303,1
"A less positive experience than others this time.  Basically, everyone else who has left one, two or three stars has said it all.  Las Vegas to Phoenix Flight 171 on April 17, 2014, I'm stuck here for the next nine hours, despite my early bird check in.  The reason the airline mentioned for this less positive experience is that someone forgot to process the check-ins.  I guess someone woke up one day and decided, oh, I'm not going to do my job today.  I used to always avoid this airline because of the unnecessary and tremendous stress and chaos, but since the assigned numbers in A, B or C, I recently decided to come back.  I'm not so sure after today.  Overall, the low cost and convenient locations cause me to buy from them and the service is adequate.  Fingers crossed for more positive experiences again, in the future.  As for this trip, well, you know how life is sometimes.  Things could always be worse.",218,2
"The menu changed pretty drastically and I'm fully convinced that it's been (gordon) ramsayed. Let me explain what I mean. I've watched enough kitchen nightmares and eaten at Ramsay's burgr to realize that by the time Ramsay is done with a restaurant, the menu becomes short and concise, portions are very exact - just enough to get full, and combos so to speak are non existent. Now I don't know for a fact that Ramsay had anything to do with the drastic changes (it's just my theory), but it sure felt that way.\n\nI enjoyed my food, but honestly, I was really disappointed with the changes. There isn't much unique about this place anymore. Before, they had all sorts of different options for burgers - lamb, salmon, chicken, burgers (even a kobe beef option), and it had sort of a French twist to it. Now, everything was pretty standard for any other high end burger place. I was kind of fantasizing about the lamb burger, so seeing it removed from the menu was kind of tragic to me. It also somewhat annoyed me that about a third of the significantly reduced menu entrees were hot dogs or bratwursts. Not that I have anything against hot dogs, except the name of the restaurant is BURGER Brasserie.\n\nThey also used to have combo options, where you could add fries and/or milkshakes at somewhat of a discount as opposed to ordering separately, and those were gone too.\n\nI got the shaft bleu burger and my boyfriend got the french onion burger. Mine was delicious, but there was a bit much bleu cheese for my taste. The french onion was good, but in my opinion, it's pricey for just being gruyere and onions.\n\nWe also got the gravy fries and the chocolate nutella milkshake. One thing that I thought was odd was that all the milkshakes on their menu had alcohol, which is fine because I didn't mind the alcohol. But if I didn't want the alcohol, I would have been a bit upset to pay for it and have them not include the alcohol. I liked the nutella shake from my last visit a lot better. Don't know why, but it wasn't as good this time. The gravy fries had really delicious flavor, but unfortunately were a touch too oily for my taste and also, like I said, I feel like it was Ramsayed because the portion was considerably smaller than what I expected (last time when we got bleu cheese fries, the portion was very generous - the bleu cheese fries were also no longer on the menu). I mean I'm not expecting them to be healthy by any means (they're called gravy fries for pete's sake), but I didn't like seeing all the oil seeping out.\n\nService:\nOur waitress (Nicolette) was wonderful. She walked us through the new menu, and came to check on us enough, but not too much and she was very friendly.\n\nThe hostesses on the other hand...were just meh...there were three of them that were just kind of huddled around the stand. There was a wait time to be seated, even though there were plenty of open tables. (This might not have been their fault though...I don't know if the restaurant was understaffed or something...I don't know this for sure, but regardless it was still weird to me.) When it was our turn to get seated, they just called out my name. But they didn't call it very loudly and I think it was just chance I heard it, because my boyfriend didn't hear it. There's a water fountain right outside the entrance to BB and there's a lot of people walking through so it's hard to hear. But it seemed like they weren't making a lot of effort.\n\n\nOverall: I'm disappointed with the changes. The experience this time really was just ok, hence the 3 star rating. There's nothing special about this place that will really cause me to make a special trip anymore.",858,2
"Everyone should go here for their Palace Pan Roast. The best in town! I've waited 2 hours to be seated and another hour for my Pan Roast. There is always a line and that should tell you something. The Palace Pan Roast is so good that you won't ever try another menu item. Well, maybe you will but not anytime soon. The staff is very friendly, the only downfall is that service is slow but that is due to them always having three people on duty.  When you are in Vegas you have to stop by for their Roast.",116,4
I am giving this place 2 stars because I got a really good price on a rental in Vegas for 3 days coming to a total which includes taxes for $54.90.\n\nThey lose three stars for the total hard sale and major push for upselling once we got to the rental agency.  The lady helping us even went so far as to tell us about the risk of getting into a fender bender with all the foreighners driving from other countries.  She put the fear of God into us about the risk of driving in Vegas and almost sold me until she told us the price for the insurance which was $79 additional for the three days!  Me thinks NOT!\n\nDriving in Vegas was way better than driving in San Francisco and it was mostly just slow moving near the Strip.\n\nBased on that I may use them again but will be prepared for the hard sale next time!!,191,1
"Highly misinformed nutritional information. The menu reads like a list of the worst possible foods for your body, and the shakes don't contain actual whole ingredients. You know, like fruits and vegetables. They give you a 'weight loss tea' with your 'smoothie', both are made from a powder and (or) flavor syrups. I ordered the Orange Julius, which I thought might have some semblance of fruit flavor...it did not. The 'smoothie' was grainy, artificial tasting and unfulfilling. There is nothing in the Herbalife powder they use, that offers any real nutritional benefit. Just another method of hocking an ineffective product and furthering a well known MLM pyramid, which is almost as unsavory as the shakes/teas themselves. $7 for a junk, powdered shake that bloats you, doesn't even taste like real food and offers no real nutritional benefit? No thank you!!",189,0
"This a cute little bar/gourmet to-go lunch spot that is in the bottom of Panorama Towers.  Kind of has a 1920's speakeasy vibe.  As much as my group enjoyed the d\u00e9cor, we were not sold on the food and drinks we ordered.  The Swedish Ginger I ordered was a tasty take on a Moscow Mule, but the drinks my friends ordered were basically the size of a shot and way too sweet.  For $12 a pop, the drink better be good. \n\nOur server was very friendly.  Service was attentive, too attentive, in fact.  I always feel like such a jerk when I get annoyed at being checked on every 5 minutes, but you know what I mean.  If you ask someone 3 times if they are okay after finishing dinner and they always say YES!, you really do not need to ask a 4th time.  All told, nothing I had would make me venture this close to the strip, but if you're in the neighborhood, it might be worth checking out.",232,2
"I come here often and have tried various foods and desserts and always love them. I have even had an antelope burger and kangaroo brats here. When they have something new or limited it's always a tasty treat. They also have a nice rotating beer selection. I really love the beer and donut pairings that they do. And the owners and staff are so friendly and welcoming, I feel more like I am going to visit friends or family and I can relax rather than going to a loud, stuffy restaurant (as I feel about many other places).\n\nPS: Love the tables with a couch on one side. I mean, if that's not relaxing...",136,4
get sloshed in a.. church.  heck yeah!  whoever thought of putting a microbrewery in a church is a genius.. try the 5 spice beer.  food is not bad.  stay away from the pittsburg salad.  french fries on top of salad is not a good combination.  come on pittsburg.. u can come up with something better than that!,84,3
"No inventory, no service. The trees looked weak and not cared for. The people their do not care if you need help or not they are just their to take your order. The nicest people were the ones that did not speak English but always at least tried to help by getting something. Not very happy with this place. Only went their looking for one tree that I was having a hard time finding and they did not hardly have any trees at all.",92,0
These must be the most miserable employees at any Starbucks I've ever been to. Not friendly at all. Customer service? Seriously lacking. So why do I come here? Desperation or if I didn't have time to make it to a Starbucks before work. And the coffee is good. At least they get that right.,68,1
"This is a huge, noisy, very colorful food market with the same layout that you'd find in the other Pro's Ranch markets.  Lots and lots of inexpensive food items including many things you won't find in most supermarkets, especially if you're looking for ingredients for Mexican cuisine. The market is well-organized, with distinct areas with huge signs - Carniceria, Pescaderia, Jugos, etc. And do try the in-store eatery / taqueria which serves good street tacos, enchiladas, and other standard mass-appeal Mexican dishes.",118,3

"Went here with a bunch of my co-workers on a random trip to Vegas. We figured going to an AYCE buffet instead of a regular sit-down would be easier to go to with a large group. I've always wanted to try the Buffet here at the Wynn from word of mouth. For a Saturday night (7pm), we were seated fairly quickly. \n\nThere are many different types of food here, from crab legs to prime rib. Their meats are great. They didn't have much of a sushi selection though and no sashimi. The other items I tried were good too. Dessert is great too, but I only a few samples because I was already too full. \n\nHowever, even though it was good, I didn't feel it was the best buffet I've been to in Vegas. I've gone to a few that are just as good, but are cheaper as well. I'm glad I got to try it, but I probably won't make it back here in favor of the other Vegas AYCE buffets.",224,3
"My first and last experience at Casa Don Juan had to have been one of the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. \n\nThe overall atmosphere of the restaurant is unaccommodating and unwelcoming, and the staff treats you like trash if you ask for the simplest things. On top of their already overpriced dishes, charging $1.50 for a small spoonful of sour cream and accusing their customers of LYING when they receive the wrong order leads me to believe that the restaurant honestly doesn't care about their customers, and they are only out to leech money from them. \n\nIt would be much more worth your time and experience going to another fine Mexican restaurant in town like Bonito Michoacan on Decatur than to be harassed and provided with the lousy service at Casa Con Juan. It's a shame, really.",174,0
"Very funky brewpub that would fit right in on South Street Philadelphia.  Open late with great pub food, we got the locally made sausages which were excellent, thankfully they do not serve poutine, the ghastly signature snack of Montreal.

"I've hiked Camelback twice in the past month. Once, about 3/4 of the way up and then my partner (with her severe ear damage) started swaying and losing her balance. So we headed back down, but I knew the trail was a little bit treacherous. Then I hiked it legit to the top and back down. \n\nI'm not an experienced hiker. I'd say I'm in average shape (I run about 8 - 12 miles a week). So make sure to factor these things in to your review of my advice:\n\nGo during the week if you can. I did the partial hike on a Sunday afternoon and I lost a lot of the cardio/self-directed experience as I felt like I was hiking in a single file line for a lot of it. I had the luxury of the doing the full hike, solo, on a Monday morning because of Cesar Chavez's bday and the resulting holiday. So there was still a crowd (as I'm assuming there always is at Echo Canyon) being that it's a state holiday. But the comparison between that and a Sunday afternoon is incredible. I actually got to choose my own pace and path!\n\nAlso, park at the circle lot on 44th (left hand side of the road) before you get to Echo Canyon. Just walk the 8 minutes to the trail. Seriously, it kills me to see people waiting for 20 minutes in their car to park in the Echo Canyon lot before they hike a 1.5 mile mountain summit!? What? Park far away (legally...heed the legality for sure), get out of your car, and walk/run to the trail. \n\nTake sun tan lotion and water. I consider myself in pretty good shape and I sucked up my entire camelback (ironic) pack on the ascent and didn't have any water for the descent (the scary part!) which sucked.\n\nOtherwise enjoy! I'm looking forward to trying out some other climbs. So please, everyone keep posting your hiking reviews/tips/warnings. They are extremely helpful!",448,3
I've been wanting to try this place out for years and I finally got a chance to try it out. I had the burger with truffles and it was probably the best burger I've ever had. It was juicy and had a great flavor on top of the earthiness of the truffles. They also give you a trio of tapenades that were very good. I can't wait to back and try other items on the menu. Oh I forgot to mention that it has amazing view of the Bellagio fountains!!,107,4

"I used to have a monthly subscription to their golfing range.  I really like the fact that we could golf off the grass, but was quickly turned off when they started to force us to hit of astro turf.  \nWhat really made my experience stink was a young male staff member who works in the pro shop.  This kid constantly busts my balls over me not bringing in my key for balls and accused me of \""sharing\"" balls with non-paying members.  After a few times of this rude, totally unnecessary, and unprofessional behavior I cancelled my subscription.  Upon leaving the pro shop on my last visit, I reported the problem employee to the shop manager; they both apparently support this poor behavior, as they both turned, looked at me, and casually snickered while the manager jokingly delivered the news to the problem employee.\n  The combination of poor employees, the frugality regarding saving green surface at the range (seems to be all the time we're forced to hit off astro turf), and the fact that employee's don't take responsibility for their crap attitudes makes this place a real crap hole!",231,0
"I was surprised at how unenthusiastic I was about this experience, especially given how much I love the other place (the Qing Hua near Concordia).\n\nHere's what's not all that thrilling about the Chinatown Qing Hua:\n1) Fewer dumplings.  Also a little cheaper, but still.\n2) Awkward interactions with the staff.  The waiter was uncomfortable, possibly did not speak sufficient French or English, and didn't know how to seat people.  He filled tables in lines, possibly so that he wouldn't have to walk the extra four feet to cross the room, and it made for crowding and awkwardness because over half of the dining room was empty but you were still surrounded by full tables.\n3) Some of the dumplings have that little ridge that's stiff.  I don't know why this happened, as it's never been the case at the other place, but I think that it might be from freezing the dumplings.\n\nSo... if you want fabulous dumplings, go to the other Qing Hua.",221,1
I live in the neighborhood & couldn't wait for Scratch to open.  Decor is tr\u00e9s chic.  I would give my rating four stars but the service needs some extra training (server should know what a b\u00e9chamel sauce \nis if working in a French restaurant) & a bit more personality & interest. Food is served promptly but it's the initial service that's the first impression.  I love living downtown & happy to see more businesses popping up. I want them to be successful.

OMG it was soo expensive! but it gave me a really good buzz throughout the whole time i was there. the reason for the 3 stars because there wasn't much seating space just to hang around and chill. venue was just okay. it wasn't as nice architecturally. just 2 big pools and some tables and a space to dance by the DJ.\n\nunlike encore beach club they have stripper poles in the middle of the pool which was really fun! they also have a lot of places to sit and the pools are much nicer!,207,2

"'Fleabag hotel' would be a fair description of this one. When I stayed over there two years ago, the lighting in the reception area was hypnotic. What really bummed me out, however, was the dinginess. It seemed the carpet in my room hadn't been vacuumed for days. I also saw spots and fibers on the sheets, too. Well I didn't even wanna think about their sources. Fortunately bathroom was not so bad, but there wasn't any disposable slippers. I called and was told they didn't have any. Seriously?! I couldn't help overestimating the risk of catching some bacterial or viral strain, so I literally sacked out for three days. Horrible experience. To top it off, TV in my room had virtually no signal, and the hotel is about 2 miles away from the busy stretch of the Strip.

"Spirit certainly has some really low fares. Now that we have that out of the way, I must say that it certainly is a you get what you pay for airline. \nI fly around a decent amount and I've learned what works with them and what doesn't. \nHere's what works: They fly to a lot of cities, a lot of their flights are direct flights without layovers. The staff at the airports have always been pleasant and courteous. They also have great last minute deals in case your flight is An emergency or if you're going on a spontaneous adventure.  People have said that their flights are bumpy and rickety but I've always had smooth sailing\nNow, here's what doesn't work. I'm about 6'3 and 210 pounds so I expect to be cramped, but their flights take it to another level. Their bag check in fees are higher than most. Their seat choice fee is higher than mist, hell just about anything an airline charges for is higher with spirit. They also love to find ways to nickel and dime the customers.  They also don't have much variety in the sense that their routes only fly once a day, for example the only Vegas to Baltimore flight is an 1130 red eye. It's a deal breaker unless you're flexible. It's also a bit of an issue because if you miss your flight you're straight SOL for awhile\n TL;DR spirit is awesome if your flight is under 3 hours and if you're packing light. Everything else, I'd generally recommend paying the difference and enjoying the comfort",344,1

I asked them to leave off the grapefruit, beets, and add salami. I thoroughly enjoyed it, wow!

I could barely eat it which stunk because I was really looking forward to having it again. Other than that, i liked the environment.

Hmm maybe coming on Sunday was not the right timing. \n\nA.  Miso soup 1 star. Uninspiring and not tasteful. Almost water like. The consistency was very diluted. The miso was not suspended well in the broth and the broth was  well watery. \n\nB.  Salad - 1 star - they serve the salad with Miso Dressing and the salad was drenched in this!  The bottom inch of the bowl was full of miso dressing. Liquid. Japanese food is all about subtlety and this was not subtle. \n\nC. Teppan yaki-  3 star - we ordered 4 orders of steak and lobster and they only had three. That is odd and yet they did offer to split it four ways and brought lots of shrimp. So that was a great solution. The steak was good, the chicken good, the salmon great, the fried rice nice. Okay stuff overall.   A big believer in Japanese food and natural flavored and since there is so much sauce I say this was good just hard to compare. \n\nI like the place. I think it is a good place to entertain friends. \n\nThe entertainment factor is great,  the teppan yaki is okay too. I will be coming back to try the sushi as many yelpers rave about this!",515,2
"We were excited to have our wedding at Sunset Gardens, and part of the appeal was its all inclusive package. Everything looked nice and thankfully we had a great time with our family and friends, but some of the services were just horrible. \n\nFirst, the DJ waited until 3 days before the wedding to contact us and boast about his 30 years experience, but then he played barely anything from a list we put together for him. He is old school and only has music on CD or Vinyl. Then he would play the full length of every song, which to me seemed lazy. When people are dancing we would like to mix it up and keep the tracks changing, not just play long drawn out songs the whole time. I even made it a point to explain before hand that I did not want him to play the songs all the way through. And beside the fact he barely played anything we asked for, he played the one artist I specifically told him not to play. The DJ seemed like his 30 years experience and his guarenteed job at Sunset Gardens, makes him take it all for granted.\n\nAnd then there was the photograaphy service: let me just say, the pictures our guests took with their cell phones came out better than this, and then there are additional fees for the touch ups. The exposure on all the pictures is too bright, the bridesmaids SILVER DRESSES are white, when they should be SILVER and people know that a BRIDE picks the colors for a certain reason. And then me, the groom, I was only asked to take two pictures with my groomsmen. For the first picture, I was pulled outside and it was taken on the side of the building, with the yellow curb and graffiti cover up on the wall. Then the photographer took pictures after the ceremony and we had to ask if we could get maby more than one background for our shots. He also rushed every shot and noone was ready so we have some people smiling and others adjusting themselves. Afterwards, we recieve the disc, there are barely any of our guests in the pictures, and only one shot of me with one of my guests. Again, we got the boast, we have been doing this for 30 years. We were even given that same boast by Tony.\n\nWhat it seems to me is that these 30 year veterans need a fresh approach to their game. They are lazy and untalented. We will not be able to get this day back and thank God we have our memories, because these pictures are crap. \n\nI would highly suggest not doing an all inclusive package and make sure you can review everyone of your services prior to booking a wedding. OH and the airplanes were annoying and interupting our ceremony.",569,0
"What I'm about to say, I mean with all of the gravitas you can take away from it.\n\nI want Tommy to go steady with me, tattoo-artist-my-body-is-your-canvas-style.  I live 6 hours away, and I will be going to only Tommy for all of my tattoos.  Period.  His artistic eye is perfect, his skill is amazing, and he can interpret your less-than-clear wants and needs and mind-read you to create exactly what you want.\n\nThey were super friendly, very sweet and helpful, and I want Judy to adopt me, if she's looking for 30-year old kids.\n\nI've been around the tattoo block quite a few times in DC and Richmond, and I have never been in a shop that was more welcoming and fun.",184,4
"I went to this place with my bf last Sunday. Overall we were quite impressed. A solid 4,  maybe 4.5 for sure. We plan to go back again this weekend. I'll give a more detailed review by then. All I want to say for now is: if only half Chinese restaurants in U.S are operated with the standards of this cafe, Chinese food as a brand would get a much better reputation and much more respect.",95,3
"Went here for a late Valentine's day dinner. We had set reservations well in advance. The restaurant had kind of a cheesy sky painted in the ceiling. We were placed in a corner table near the bar. It wasn't a huge deal but I did feel separated from the rest of the restaurant. Overall, the decor isn't high end but it's not terrible either.\n\nWe were seated immediately by the hostess, which is always nice when it's a busy Friday night. Our service was relatively spot on the entire night. They took a little long on the salad my girlfriend order, but they gave her a full salad instead of the half to compensate. Otherwise, we felt attended to pretty much the whole night.\n\nThe food was very good. I ordered the halibut, which was the special for the night. It came out tasting light and very good. My girlfriend ordered the chicken parm which I thought was terrific. Had the creme brulee for dessert and that was great as well.\n\nOverall, we were very happy with our meal and night.",225,3
"The noise makes it almost impossible to talk. The staff looks like the customers or the customers are better dressed. Staff is wrinkled, sunglasses on the back of their head, it's hard to know who you supposed to ask for help. Once you know, they are responsive, friendly and willing to please.\n\nThe food is fair, dressings, sauced are too watered down. The food is minimal in terms of amounts for the money. It is a favorite among the neighborhood but these are now the adults whom hung out at the old Monastery behind Whitney & Murphy funeral home. I am beginning to think my fellow Az peeps have no idea what good casual food is about. The service in AZ is terrible, all of customer service in businesses here is terrible, restaurants and retail.\nwatch out for the Valets, they drive customers cars too fast around the parking lot, here and Arcadia Tavern!\n\n\nI am entitle to my opinion since I have worked my way through school as a waitress/bartender , valet service manager and service consultant.\n\nDeb",220,1
"Comfortable pub that's been operating under the same name for many years (which is usually an indicator of historical significance, and is often a sign of quality).\n\n\n Stone walls and a busy tartan carpet give the bar an authentic feel. There's a separate area for folk having meals, and it does get very busy.\n\n\n Given that it's on the Royal Mile, it's a real tourist trap. Best get there early to get one of the few window seats if you can.",109,3
"So I wrote a review for Papago Brewing way back in the day when I was still new to this whole Yelp thing... so now that I'm a bit more seasoned, I'd like to write an update!\n\nI originally gave Papago 5 stars, and I still don't have a bad word to say about it! This has been my go to bar, my \""Cheers\"", since I first moved to Phoenix two years ago. I've made a lot of friends here (customers AND employees), and I've consumed MANY amazing beers here! I can always count on them having several new craft beers on tap every time I show up, and the staff is very well educated on each of them. Zach, Jess, Matt, Mark, and Sean take great pride in the fact that they are beer nerds (like my wife and I), and always have great suggestions when I can't make up my mind! With 26-30 beers on tap, and several coolers full of different bottled beer from all over the world, it's never hard to find something I'll love!\nThe pizza here is some of my favorite in the valley! We always order the White Pizza, but you have to try the Buffalo Chicken Pizza or the T-Rex! You can't go wrong!\nPapago recently expanded to make more room for their rapidly growing business, as the place is consistently packed almost every night of the week! The new side boasts locally handcrafted tables and benches, as well as a regulation size shuffleboard table!\nWhatever your beer-drinking needs, you'll find it here at Papago Brewing Company!",341,4
"I don't really understand this place.  It seems like a cool lounge where you hang out and chat with friends, but the music is way too loud for that.  There isn't any space to dance or walk around and mingle.\n\nI came in with a huge group, and we didn't fit anywhere.  Everyone was looking at us, we were in the way in so many different place.\n\nWe came for the coffee shot, and we all had it.  It was tasty.\n\nThey were quick to bring out our shots, and passed them all at the same time which was cool.",133,2
"Two issues with this place:\n\nFirst, this is basically a store-front version of Isogenix/Body By Vi/Shakeology/P90x etc etc. No, it's not the same company (that I know of), but it's certainly the exact same idea. I thought this was a smoothie place (like Jamba Juice) and it is not.\nIt's a meal-replacement shake place or a workout shake place with addon programs.\nEverything is based on sign ups, before and after photos, and so on.\n\nIt's rather faddish if you ask me, and somewhat deceptive if you're given a \""free smoothie\"" card on the street. This place screams MLM, or, if you prefer, \""network marketing.\"" I thought I was going to a health-food like smoothie bistro, but maybe that's my bad. I won't hold that against them.\n\nSecond, the place is a wreck of boxes and marketing material all over the store, and the worse, it's not that clean. The bathroom was filthy, and the rest of the store wasn't much cleaner. I'm hoping they washed their hands. Please God, let them have washed their hands before making my shake.\n\nThe tea is average, nothing terrible, nothing outstanding.\n\nThe shake is a powdered shake, with reasonable flavor for a powdered shake.\n\nThat being said, I'm not going back. If I want a healthy shake I want real fruit and juice in it, not powder, and I don't need a workout plan that I pay for.\nIf I need a powdered shake mix, I'll buy it online for a lot less.",366,1
"Sorry BJ'S, our last visit has made me decide that we can no longer be friends. Although you do normally serve delicious food, our last visit here during the early evening hours left us wanting more. Our server ignored us for our entire meal, we had to get her attention for more napkins and water (even after she said she'd be back with more water), and she seemed entirely pre-occupied. We had our 2 year old with us and that, unfortunately, sometimes seems to scare our servers off. Our child was very well-behaved and we ALWAYS clean up after ourselves. Although you are normally an awesome place for happy hour or a dinner for two, please do not ignore your paying customers (and good tippers I might add) just because they have a little one.",162,0
"Mastro's has the best steaks I have had in Arizona. Their quality is outstanding and their side dishes are great as well. Seafood is excellent and I have never had something here that I don't enjoy.\n\nThe bar area has a great live band and is an awesome place to relax and enjoy a drink or dinner as well. \n\nThe price is much higher than most places, but the experience and quality makes it well worth it.",96,4

"This was a top notch experience.  My best friend was given a surprise trip to Vegas by her husband and they came in for the weekend...they told me they like Italian food and I know one of the family's sons that owns the restaurant...had been meaning to try it for a long time, so I made a reservation for Saturday night.\n\nGaetano's pulled out all stops - we were given the nice bread basket with olive oil and basalmic, but also a sampler of items including bruschetta, gnocchi with bolognese sauce, spinach ricotta ravioli and butternut squash ravioli with sage and brown butter.  I could tell the pasta is homemade.\n\nThey had tons of specials on top of a large menu, and we got a wine special that was really delicious.  My friend and her hubby ordered a salad course, but my guy and I did not mind taking the time to digest our starter treats.  I ordered smoked salmon ravioli with lime shallot cream sauce (a special), and it was delicious!!!  My guy got veal ravioli, my friend got a half order of the spinach ricotta rav and her husband got chicken marsala with gnocchi.\n\nWe were treated to tiramasu with a candle and cannolli for my friend's birthday and given an additional discount for her celebration.  The food was excellent, the service equal to any fine dining establishment, and the prices extra-reasonable.  The place filled up after we were seated too.  I would return with my parents for another special occasion.\n\nPeople wore a range of dress, but it was fun to wear a cocktail dress.  The interior of the restaurant is very nice and it felt like a special experience.",355,4
"American-style Chinese restaurants may not be authentic, but I grew up with them and love them, and Golden Harvest is about the best I've had anywhere. There are many Chinese joints closer to us, but we always take the extra time to drive to Golden Harvest.\n\nMy litmus test is Kung Pao Chicken. GH uses good quality chicken in an oh-so-tasty sauce that I mop up with rice when the chicken's gone. I'm not a big fan of orange chicken (it's usually a gloppy mess of gristly meat), but GH again uses good meat and fries it to a perfect crispiness that stands up to the sweet sauce. My wife, a tofu lover, is addicted to their deep-fried pillow tofu (seriously, try it). In over 10 visits, every single dish we've tried has been a winner.\n\nGolden Harvest is the gold standard for American Chinese in the southeast valley. On top of that they have dinner combos for under $10. What's not to love? Forget PF what's-his-name, this is the place to go.",237,4
"Ended up going to visit my first strip club while I was visiting friends in Phoenix.  The website looked classy, although the outside of the place looks a bit shady, it was worth the $8 cover.  They had $2 drafts and the girls were mostly amazing looking outside of one or two.  They have some extremely athletic and talented pole dancers (watch for Paige on the topless side), and some extremely amazing dancers on the nude side (Nadia).  \n\nThe decor of the inside of the place is very classy, in an attempt to make you feel like you're in a lodge up in Alaska, with antler chandeliers to complete it.  \n\nThe bartenders and wait staff were nice, the dancers were nice, and the bouncers seemed decent, not at all what I expected when I read other reviews here.  The dancers were not pushy, and overall I think this was a pretty decent strip club -- considering it was my first one ever.",204,3
"The service was friendly,  but the Chicago beef sandwich was piled high with freezer burn, cuts of dry, grisly,  low quality meat.  I was craving this sandwich but it was not good.  The red and green peppers I thought would be the hot and sweet one (classic Chicago) I'd be enjoying were literally red and green Bell peppers... I gave the meat to my dogs.  The pickle was good. I wasted ten dollars on bread,  I'm very disappointed",102,1
"I'm with Cheryl.  I would be shocked if they make it.  Limited menu, there wasn't an entree salad option.  Ordered dinner salad and it tasted like ready made bag salad and bottled dressing.  My husband had Chicken Alfredo and sauce tasted like it was canned.  The bread was a warmed hoagie roll.\nI don't think they make anything from scratch.  \nI hate to be so negative but I don't think they are really trying!  No one greeted us when we walked in and they didn't greet anyone else who came in after us, it was awkward.",129,0
"Great entertainment, but I was a bit puzzled by some of the ongoing themes in the show. There was an annoying jokester usher and a human baby that would interact with a mama in the audience, but both were running themes that I thought detracted from the main acrobatic acts.\n\nThe acrobatic acts were spectacular though. These people are very talented and it shows. If you like death defying moves, I would recommend watching this show. However, I think the other Cirque shows might be more sophisticated in terms of special effects.",110,2
"I would have given another star if they hadn't run out of horchata. To say that my heart was broken is an understatement when I was told the news. The endless supply of chips and variety of salsas did occupy my thoughts. Yet, while my mouth was on fire and all my taste buds started sizzling away, I couldn't help but yearn for my horchata that was not to come. The carne asada taco and the shrimp tacos (both types) were all very good. I will definitely be back.",108,3
"Where to start....1) we were sat by the bathroom where all you can smell is the urinal cakes. 2) our server seemed like he couldn't get rid of us fast enough, basically throwing things on the table as he ran by yo all his other tables. 3) our food was terrible and apparently they think more with less means you pay MORE for LESS food. 4) the automatic pay machine was a nice touch until it automatically suggested a 20% tip, not going to happen. 5) we won't be back the best part of the evening was leaving.",125,0
"Phoenix Sky Harbor is fine inside as far as airports go. Crappy, overpriced food options, the Hudson News, outdated carpeting...The usual. Apparently there are good restaurants in some terminals, but I've never seen them. I have typically traveled at off peak times of day, so my time going through security isn't too bad. I've yet to get patted down or searched, so it's been OK from that standpoint. \n\nMy big beef with Sky Harbor is the drop off/pick up situation...It's a complete cluster. It's giant, and quite confusing. If you're new to the area and need to get to the airport and pick someone up, good luck. \n\nIt's right in the middle of the city so it's convenient to get to, but not convenient at all to navigate. If I'm ever lucky enough to fly into or out of a terminal with the great food I keep hearing about, maybe I'll update my review.",213,2
"I'm really conflicted about this place.  The food was good, but not that much better than any other take out in my general area.  We ate in which also colors my review.\n\nThe first thing that struck me when we went in was how messy every table was.  At that point, I asked my wife if she wanted to do take out instead, but she said we'd wait.  A gentleman who just finished his complimentary egg drop soup while he was waiting for his takeout, got up from his table and offered it to us.  It was at this time that the woman showed up.  She cleaned off the table and we were seated by the door.\n\nFrom then, it was a bit of a wait for her to cover the few tables in the place, answer the phone, and give take out orders to people as they came in.  After a fair amount of time--nothing outrageous--she came to take our order.  My wife wanted the garlic chicken.  I wanted the pork with garlic sauce which was listed on the menu as hot and spicy.  She questioned each of us on what type of vegetables we liked.  I didn't understand this, but when I ordered, I guess she assumed we would be sharing and since my wife already had ordered a garlic dish, I wouldn't want the same.  Again, a discussion of what kind of vegetables I liked.  She then suggested I get one of two other pork dishes.  I ended up ordering the twice cooked pork.  I really didn't come for a discussion on vegetables as well intentioned as that might have been.\n\nWe got a complimentary cup of egg drop soup which was good.  My wife liked her chicken with garlic sauce and I liked my twice cooked pork, but it wasn't spicy.  And, during the meal, I couldn't help look at the table ahead and to my left where every dirty dish from every other table ended up for a temporary home, but they stayed there during the hour plus we were in the restaurant.  I realize it's a mom and pop operation but when there are only 4 tables, it becomes an issue.\n\nI liked the woman.  She was quite friendly and had a good sense of humor.  If I come back, it will be for takeout only and I'll call in advance.  I think I've sworn off Chinese food in the neighborhood.  I'll stick to Thai food and get Chinese in Chinatown.",524,2

"Mimi's is one of those restaurants that you want to like more.\n\nI say that because the execution is somewhat lacking.  We have been coming here, on and off, for five years now.  It's the coupons in the Sunday paper, or the email club that draw us in.  The pictures of the food look really good. But it's just, okay.  \n\nOne piece of advice for management would be to ease up on the salt.  Neither of us have sodium issues, but we would suspect that after coming here enough we would.  The gravy or sauce on our last visit was so bad, we were scrapping it off the food.\n\nAlso, time moves more slowing at Mimi's.  Maybe it's the lack of exterior windows, but it feels like I'm in a casino buffet room.  It's could also be the somewhat older crowd, who just sits, chats and just drinks coffee.   I do not believe it's the staff's fault, they seem to hustle around the place refilling drinks, etc. But, it would be hard to tell what time of day it is here.\n\nSorry!",253,1

"Went to dinner with the Better Half at the Top of the World Restaurant.  I've been there for lunch many times, but have never been for dinner.\n\nWe were seated at a table along the edge of the restaurant, which had a perfect, unobstructed view of the valley.  Since our reservations were for 6:30 pm in the 1st week of April, we knew we were going to get a great view of the sunset.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and told us to take our time.  Here's a brief summary of our experience:\n\nWine - We ordered a bottle of 2006 Scott Harvey Zinfandel.  It had a nice bite to it....hints of blackberry and pepper made it robust....yum!\n\nAppetizer - Portobello Mushroom, Red Pepper, and Buffalo Mozzarella in Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar......one of our favorites.  Very good.\n\nEntree - Lobster Tail stuffed with Crab meat.  Prime New York Strip with peppercorn crust.  Very, very good.  The meat was cooked just right.\n\nSide Dishes - Sides are ordered separately here.  We had Foie Gras, Risotto Gnocchi with Cheese, and Au Gratin Potatoes with Cheese.  The Au Gratin were a little overcooked, but the rest of them were fantastic!\n\nDessert - They offered small desserts, which is perfect because I really hate large dessert dishes.  I think they're a waste of money and food.\n\nThe Better Half had a chocolate something or other...can't remember right now (Thank you Scott Harvey!) ...I had the strawberry cheesecake lollipops and the cookies & cream lollipops....with dipping sauce and crumbled cookies....yes, they are as good as it sounds.  Check out the photos above to see them.\n\nService - We were treated well from start to finish.  We had to ask for water a few times but that was the only strike against a perfect evening.\n\nI would have scored the restaurant 5 stars, but I felt that the menu was lacking more vegetarian options.  At the time of this visit I was trying to avoid eating meat....not go vegetarian, but just avoid it for a while.  There was only a grilled vegetable option, which sounded \""blah\"" to me....so I broke my diet and went for the Prime NY Strip.\n\nWould I visit this place again?  Absolutely!  Awesome place to take your significant other and spend a romantic evening overlooking the Vegas Valley.",542,3
"They're inconsistent with their pet policies. It floors me to see that they just added a sign outside with a cat and a freaking GOLDEN RETRIEVER when they don't even accept that breed. It's ridiculous. There are at least 2 pitbulls, a dalmation, 2 labs, and a mastiff that I've seen AND heard in the complex and staff act like those are ALL service animals. Whatever. The maintance staff aren't trained well and take forever to get around to fixing stuff and forget it if it's something urgent like your toilet or washer/dryer. So glad I'm out of there now.

"This club is definitely beautiful. The location is not easy to find. Plus its not a mega club with 3000 seats. There's plenty of seats. It's very intimate. I went there for a job interview actually. I scoped the place out before and it was pretty dead. Doesn't really bump till about 10pm.  The bar there is very nice with great selections. Upstairs has another beautiful bar. Plus there's private rooms that are very intimate, each one is different. It's almost like a club setup. The DJs pretty cool. The bar staff is very friendly. The girls here....well I watched this one...Kennedy who was a headliner. The stomach and leg control for pole tricks were the best I've ever seen. EVER! FOR E VERRRRR! Yea She can give Cirque people a run for their money. It was A MAZ ING! I wasn't sure if she was a snake, or monkey, but she....yea WOW. I was too nervous to get a lapdance due to injuries I thought I would sustain. But over all there were about 4-5 girls I would have gotten dances with. Drink specials go on. Sundays I think it's beers and Jack and Cokes for 3 bucks.\nCurrently they don't have a lot of traffic. We went to Live Band Night which is Sundays. I think it has a LOT of potential. Not too many girls. But I bet if I didn't have ten people with me, that we would get more action ;) I would go to Minxx again. Regardless if I get a job there or not. BTW If I bartend there, you better come see me.Yes they did have a bad rap with Pacman Jones shooting.  But the reality is - there's shootings anywhere. This just happened to be someone famous. Give it to October. I'll bet this place will be bumpin. \nHaha I bought my friend Billy a dance from this tattooed girl named Flower. She was really sweet. He was scared. Kinda like Home Alone 2 scared....Her boobies were gonna hurt him. There was fear in that boy's eyes....",457,3
"Kevin's Deli is this amazing little place that can be found in Webster Hall in Oakland.  The easiest way to find it is to turn down N. Dithridge Street from Fifth Ave and pull off to the left into the loading zone.  (You'll see the deli's window on the first floor to the left of the entrance.)  Enter Webster Hall at this entrance and you'll find Kevin's Deli to the left. \n\nI'm not sure how I first learned about Kevin's Deli, but I suspect it was one of the few reviews here on Yelp.  Shortly after, a Groupon became available so I jumped on the chance.  Not that the Groupon was necessary since Kevin's Deli is super-cheap.  Most items on the menu are $5 or less.  It's a bargain but well worth it.  Kevin knows what he's doing with the simple things.  Like the Turkey Bacon Club with fresh turkey and bread that is toasted to perfection.  I don't know where he gets his steak or what he does to it when he cooks it but I've had both the steak pita and the steak hoagie with fries and been amazed at how great it tastes.  I will be back to try some of the other items I've read are good.  Like the chicken salad, pasta salad or even that pound cake.  He also offers many breakfast items but I think most people go in for the lunch sandwiches.\n\nI suspect that most of his business comes from local businesses and college students.  Don't go late (Kevin's Deli closes at 4:30pm) or on the weekend (open Monday through Friday).  You may be confused because he operates out of a very small room that was likely someone's office at one time.  But if it's lunch time and you're in Oakland, you can't go wrong for the price.  Kevin's Deli may be small like the prices, but the taste is bigger than you'd expect.",432,3

"I have sat on this review for awhile... I really wanted to think it through. Like I said in my last review, Atlasta catered my wedding. I was pretty disappointed. Unlike what I had experienced previously with them, my wedding was a bit of a disaster. The person I had been working with throughout the process wasn't at the wedding.... so despite many many phone calls and e mails, things were not set up correctly. I felt totally ignored and like my time had been wasted. Unlike at my friend's wedding where they came to check with her and help her set up, no one came to check with me and I had to go looking for them (in my wedding dress!) to ask them to put something on the tables... people saw me before the ceremony... not cool. The food served was not the food discussed throughout the planning process. Items were missing sauces, salads that were supposed to be served as salad 'tacos' were served in a bowl. Our whole idea of small plates and stations was not pulled off due to their poor presentation and their disregard for what we had talked about previously. I didn't get to eat much, but what I ate was not at the level I had expected. We were supposed to have grilled cheese with tomato soup shots.... the tomato soup was missing for most of the night... the grilled cheese was cold and flavorless. I think the worst thing was that we spoke to them extensively about having to have vegan and vegetarian options for our guests that were labeled.... we had a vegetarian mac and cheese that was supposed to be served with bowls of toppings for the people to add themselves.... the mac and cheese was labeled vegetarian, but not only were there no bowls of toppings, but they put bacon in it!!!! This is unacceptable for my vegetarian guests.... Additionally, they forgot to put out a knife for us to cut the cake with... so we used a butter knife... nice. Anyway, there were many other disappointing aspects to this company, but I won't get into it. I would not recommend them for your special day...they certainly put a damper on mine.",430,1
"Lots of cool cars, parking is busy but it's vegas so deal with it. The staff is around and they are very friendly.",29,4
"Eat here at your own risk.  This place is horrible!  We went around 12pm, which must be the start of their lunch rush because they were very busy. But we were sat at a table immediately.  It was approximately $9/person - without drinks.  There ends the good news.  The food is tasteless and it wasn't fresh. The employees are very rude.  And it is extremely loud in there (maybe because of the tile floors). A few hours after eating there, both me and my friend were experiencing stomach discomfort.  I will never eat here again.",125,0
"Some Wal-Marts are located out in more rural areas and some are in more urban areas. This is one of the urban ones and while I don't know if there is a direct correlation from store quality to local population, I know that this is a Wal-Mart that I did enjoy shopping.\n\nIt wasn't the screaming kids, it wasn't the broken wheeled cart, it wasn't even the tight parking lot with the Char-Meck police 'viewing tower' parked. It was just... dull and beat up. From the shelf stocking to the lack of engaged associates, it's just not that good. This store still has everything, but I can't really say that I will return unless I am in this area for one reason or another.\n\nTwo stars - I've experienced better. Much better.",177,1
"What a deal after sitting at the tables giving your money to the casinos.  Earl of Sandwich has really good sandwiches at very affordable prices and IT'S OPEN 24 HOURS!!  The line may be long, but they're pretty efficient so be patient and wait it out.  You'll be happy you did.",68,4

"This can't be a real Rosati's. First, it's not even listed on their official webpage as a location. Second, their pizza tastes terrible. It's not real Rosati's.\n\nOh, and the people taking orders at the front desk? They have no clue what's going on. I called in an order for pick up and they somehow had my name and number on two different orders. They tried to give me both of them when I went in. No thanks, just want the pizza I ordered, thanks. However since the pizza was gross (as was the garlic bread with cheese), I won't be ordering again.",140,1
"I used to live in San Francisco the birthplace of modern satanism and Dead Poets had the largest selection of Aleister Crowley books I have ever seen.

"Do you have tranquil place to escape to when you are on the Las Vegas Strip? I do. It is a 15 acre tropical landscape where winding brick paths with benches pass along green and lush gardens with tropical trees towering overhead. It is a tranquil place with waterfalls cascading into streams with islands. Swimming in these streams are glowing koi and catfish. Bridges look over turtles, brown pelicans, and ducks. It is a tranquil place where guinea fowl coexist with tourists. It is a tranquil place where the wildest animals are Chilean flamingos. This tranquil place is the Flamingo Wildlife Habitat.\n\n  The Flamingo Wildlife Habitat is a tranquil place that is a coin throw from the Las Vegas Strip. It sits at the back of the Flamingo Hotel between the two hotel towers, swimming pool complex, and monorail. It is the antithesis of the busy Las Vegas Strip.\n\nIt is a tranquil place on the Strip, which I go in different moods. In the afternoon, I enjoy my moments on the bench overlooking the pond by the wedding chapel while sipping tea or coffee with my head in a good book. The sounds of the waterfalls and birds are the soundtrack of a Back to Nature CD. In the spring the olfactory candy of the flowers escalates my sense of tranquility. The Flamingo Habitat is my garden on the Strip.\n\n Late at night, if I am staying overnight on the Strip, I delight in bringing my beer here. There is something spiritual about sipping a beer in a tranquil place in the dark listening to rushing waterfalls and watching flamingos. The Flamingo Habitat is my beer garden on the Strip.\n\n  Any time of the day, I enjoy bird watching. The Flamingo Habitat claims to have 300 birds. They even have a birding checklist. I enjoy sitting on my bench by the wedding chapel watching the birds diving into the pond and flying into the lush canopies above. When I have had enough of relaxing on my favorite bench, I enjoy watching the water fowl swimming below or the flamingos that are always standing. The Flamingo Habitat is my bird watching spot on the Strip.\n\n  Unfortunately my tranquil place on the Strip had been violated. Development pressure is causing restaurants to encroach onto the habitat space. Recently, a big news story was that a few drunken tourists killed a guinea fowl (like drinking by itself makes you do something like that). Being the animal lover that I am, it was difficult for me to return to the Flamingo Habitat until the staycation last week. Things have taken a turn for the better. It is encouraging that the Flamingo Habitat rescued two injured brown pelicans. Their new home is the former penguin exhibit. The Flamingo is giving them a nice life by recreating their natural habitat. A fun fact is that they are named Bugsey and Virginia after the Flamingo's founders.\n\n  If you do not have a tranquil place to escape to when you are on the Strip, why not make it the Flamingo Wildlife Habitat. It is convenient, free, and currently open 24 hours. And it is 4 stars.\n\n.................................................................................\nThis is review 60 of the Yelp 100 Challenge",653,3
"We stopped by for lunch today - it was good - but our first impression was that it is quite expensive. We \n\nspent over $24 for two sandwiches, pulled pork and brisket - 2 fries and 2 pop shoppe pops. Also, we ate \n\nin but were served in Styrofoam containers, cardboard boxes, ate with plastic forks and drank from the \n\nbottles. As per their brochure they own a meat trailer that goes to special events - I think they are still \n\nliving in that realm. Our buns (while fresh) were not toasted so became soggy quite quickly. The fries were \n\ncrispy - fresh cut and lightly salted - good job on those. The meat is apparently the star here, although I'm \n\nnot that impressed - it was good flavor and some original sauces, yes - but for the money (more brisket \n\nplease - a little light on serving size) we should be clamouring to get back to this place, which we are not. \n\nWill we go back? Maybe - if they come up with a cheaper lunch menu we're in for sure. As well, to the \n\nowners, watch some food network BBQ shows for ideas - you need to tweak your meat a little for better \n\nflavouring. As we left we were handed some promotional items - an envelope with a %10 off coupon for a \n\nreturn visit. The coupon they created inside was obviously self made - how do I say this nicely? You need \n\nto re-take the photograph professionally before for it's too late - it is of a bun of meat resting on four lettuce \n\nleaves - it looks awful. So.. bottom line with us, lower your lunch menu prices, toast your buns, use real \n\nplates, cutlery & glasses (with ice) on eat in orders, tweak your meat and after all of this if you only change \n\none thing - make sure it's that picture on your coupon. We are not being hard on this place we want it to \n\nsucceed, and know they will with some small changes. All the best to SOS.",469,2

"Follow up visit...knocked down to a 3 star rating for this review :( \n\nI guess my mistake was not ordering what I had ordered before such as their yummy shrimp dishes. \n\nThis time went with the orange chicken dinner special which came with fried rice and one egg roll. The sauce for the orange chicken was thick and tasted much like the do it yourself Chinese options you can buy at the grocery store which are never good. \n\nI could have ordered anything else on the menu and I am sure it would have been better. The rice was dry this time also unfortunately. \n\nI think this was just a matter of bad selection tonight. Hell I could have went to Panda Express if I was in the mood for orange chicken. I don't know what the hell I was thinking tonight? Oh well. \n\nI will be back, just no orange chicken for me! I should have tried the sesame chicken which I was contemplating in the first place.\n\nThe portion for their dinner special is generous. My sis and I shared it and was enough to fill us up. \n\nWe also ordered a side of (3) egg rolls for $2.50 which were good. \n\nI am a shrimp eater and will stick to that...after all they are named the Red Shrimp Company right? \n\nThe service was off this visit, the lady behind the server was a bit choppy and never once said thank you. When I told her would like the orange chicken her response was \""what else\"" then I said also an order of egg rolls she again growls at me \""what else\"". No thank you or your welcome to my thanks. Not a good visit. Truly disappointed.",367,2
"10:00pm we arrive to be told housekeeping had not gotten to our rooms yet (although later in trip a late check out was not possible), how could a room still not be cleaned by 10 pm? We later learned that this is a trick as they offer you $75 voucher to spend in the casino telling you they will call you when your room is ready, which they do not bother to do as they want you to just continue spending money at the casino. I was here for a convention and spent serious dough on this trip and wanted to be rested for the presentation so we had a drink and went to the room and went in. \nI like to be awoken with a pot of coffee but no one answered the phone at room service... ever that night. The next night they said I could have the coffee and breakfast but it would have to be at 6am as the hotel was filled to capacity. Anyone heard of unemployment? \n\nThe toilet wouldn't flush (embarrassing since bunking with a coworker). The shower door was loose and near falling off the hinge. Decor was worn. Bed was comfortable and pillows were nice. \n\nThe design of the sidewalk in the place was ridiculous... made to look like bronzed prehistoric fossil stuff. I say people tripping the first day and thought wow good thing I'm not walking in stilettos like these chicks. Next day i am in sensible shoes and rip my ankle really bad...ouch. I am still suffering from it 6 weeks later. What kills Me is security is getting me a medic and I hear him on the radio say..\""we have another one down on the sidewalk\"". \nThe restaurant food here is good but just don't expect room service. I did not think it was worth the money. I expected a nicer than average place for the few hundred we were spending. I even have vouchers from my am ex points (they wouldn't let me use them on this date I find out after I redeemed the points) for 2 free nights stay but no thank you I would rather stay home. LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS ON THIS SITE AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! They never even asked how my stay was???",459,1

"I've visited this store on a couple different occasions. It is definitely in a prime location. Like others have mentioned the atmosphere is very modern and creative. For instance, they have suggestions for almost any occasion. I liked the section on what wine to buy for \""breakups\"" or something like that. Funny. \n\nThe disappointing element was customer service. On the various times I have walked in, I was never greeted. Granted, there were other customers so I didn't expect the employee to drop what he was doing. However, once he was finished helping others I did think a little acknowledgment was appropriate (i.e., eye-contact, smile, nod). I also sent an email trying to find a particular wine for a gift and I never received a response. \n\nThree strikes...this place is on my \""out\"" list.",178,0

Don't get me wrong this is not the Overstuffed Burrito that you find at Chipotle that gets super messy and in my opinion is not very good. No this burrito is well propotioned as a meal and easy to eat. Not too messy or anything.\n\nAlso the Civeche is really great too, very fresh and crisp.\nThe only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is kinda small. That's all. \n\nHell I give them 5 in my heart!",192,3
"I checked this out like a week into my stay here to meet up with some co workers and saw that they had just enough seats for them (8 people) and none for everyone else. So that is a big boo for Heart Bar, the lack of seating. The drinks are small, but good, but overall I wouldn't mind waiting to go upstairs to their other club if the time was right, because the Heart bar is ok. \n\nLets say if you're meeting someone there for a drink, just two people, then yes go there, but if you have a group of 4 or more, check out the Venetian or Bellagio for a more spacious bar experience.\n\nenjoy.",147,1
"Armed with a $30 Local Dines gift certificate ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ), I went here last night for dinner with a party of 4.  It was the 13th of the month which is the day of the month when they have extra super deals on certain things.  For example a few entrees were $13 and your second bottle of wine is 13 cents.  It was pretty busy and loud but we were seated right away and our waitress was fast and friendly.  Food was also delivered relatively quickly.\n\nAll the other tables around us were offered bread to start but we weren't asked and none was given to us which ticked me off.  We ordered a bottle of wine and a 2nd because, hey it's only 13 cents.  Then, for an appetizer we shared the calamari.  It was very good and perfect to share even though I could have eaten it all myself.  I loved the spicy sauce stuff.  I ordered the wedge salad for myself and it was not very good.  Well, it could have been very good had the thing not been warm.  They must of had the lettuce and other toppings out of the fridge for a few hours.  Bummer.  For my main entree I ordered the burger and it was excellent.  I loved the toppings and the burger itself was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the plain fries and they were just ok.  Nothing special.  I should have ordered the sweet potato fries or chips instead.\n\nThe only thing that seriously pissed me off was that our waitress refused to honor my gift certificate.  I was going to start a fight, but I was with friends and didn't want to be rude.  Instead I'm taking to Yelp to vent my frustrations.  Anyway, I sort of understand why I cannot use a coupon for happy hour stuff or a 13 cent bottle of wine.  What I don't understand is why I can't use my gift certificate for the other 80% of the bill which came from full price items?\n\nI've purchased about 20 gift certificates over the years from Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) and this was the only place to give me a problem.  So, while I do highly recommend getting one, be prepared for a fight.\n\nAll-in-all it was a good meal and a solid neighborhood spot.  If I lived closer I might give it another shot, but the food and service aren't good enough for me to make the 15 minute drive.",556,2
"We were confronted yesterday with a very typical circumstance: on one side of the road was My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, and on the other, a small, independent Kebab shop. We rolled the dice and went with the previously unknown and unrecommended Kebab shop.\n\nBad move. \n\nFirst off, the bread they brought us was disappointing to say the least. Next to that, the chicken dish I ordered was slow out of the kitchen and mediocre at best.\n\nMore importantly, though, was the general uncomfortable vibe we were marinating in throughout the course of our lunch. The owners/managers spoke in obnoxious tones to their staff and something about the place in general gave us the heebie jeebies. When our waitress finally returned with our check, we were already halfway out the door.",170,1
I would definitely give this place more like a 4 to 5 star review for the overall ambiance... love the Biltmore area.  But if i had to rate the quality of the fish... yes I am very picky when it comes to my sushi... yeah hence  my rate of 3 stars for this place.  I love the bar and trendy cool decor.... but more for a fun bar loungy get-together than a place for authentic sushi.... regardless... I had a phenomenal time catching up with my friend:),108,2

"This is Las Vegas' version of Tea Station I guess.  The sign said \""Tea Planet\"" but everything inside had the Tea Station logo.\n\nI think it's in the Tea Station employee hand book that the servers are supposed to be rude.  We got the same crappy service in Vegas that we would normally get in the San Diego and Los Angeles locations.\n\nOur drinks took a long time to come out (the place was not packed).   We ordered green tea, green milk tea, and peppermint milk tea - they were good though, they tasted the same and the boba had the same consistency as the other locations.    \n\nTheir spicy chicken wings were pretty good, I would have to say better than the San Diego locations.\n\nThis location gets 2 stars because of the bad customer service and the lengthy time it took us to get our drinks.",184,1
This is truly not a all you can eat restaurant! The service is slow and they only let you order one thing at a time. I ordered one roll and it took about twenty minutes when you only have a 1 hour time limit to eat. I wanted to order more rolls but the waitress did not want to let me order more food till I finished with my first roll. This is bad! I know how much I can eat. I only ate one roll and I was so upset with them I paid the all you can eat price for one roll and left. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN! I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO EAT HERE EVER!,133,0
"Best greatest/bar in Vegas. We stay at the NY,Ny just for this place. Stay up late drinking and playing then wake up and go to Nine Fine and get the Irish Breakfast. Best meal of my life and the waitress was awesome. Belly full and I'm off to add poker tournament. Doesn't get any better.",70,4
Good service and friendly staff. My girlfriend took my laptop here when it crashed. I got it back running faster then ever and with newer software. They even gave me a better battery that runs longer. I will be coming back here for sure,49,3
The food is okay and cold. They forgot my Oder =( I had to wait at least 20 minutes to get served. It was mind boggling because the girl in the behind the counter didn't noticed that my food wasn't serve yet and she is the one who took my money and I paid for my food. She had a very passive look and overall I am disappointed with the service and food. \nThe staff needs to revamp their customer service and communication skills. That's why I had to give Wholly Grill one star. I would not eat there again.,120,0
"We have been to this place twice.  The first time was just shortly after they opened and they had a very limited and casual menu.  This Kenyan fusion thing was very strange.  We ordered a combination plate that had several different items on it, because we thought it would be fun to try things we hadn't eaten before.  After sampling each one, we decided we wouldn't be trying those things again, and probably wouldn't be coming back to this restaurant again.  We were there for dinner during the week and were the only ones in the place, which is scary to begin with.  \n\nI went again tonite with friends who had been there before, and said they enjoyed it.  So, I'm game, I'll try any place twice.  But after this experience, I will never go back again.\n\nI know some people will gag when I say this, but I love liver and onions, and when I see it on the menu, I will order it.  The menu had quite expanded, and was much more upscale than the first time we visited, as were the prices.  Liver and onions was $19.95.  My friends had the pork chop the last time they were in, and they ordered it again.  Our waitress, who was the only waitsperson in the place while we were there, was incredibly incompetent.  I won't go into our complaints with her.  She was bad enough, tho, that I left no tip.  I have never done that in my life.  But I digress.\n\nThe plates of food were huge.  My friends said their pork chops were good, but neither ate the veggies (carrots, asparagus, green beans) because they said they were too raw (I wished I could have eaten them off their plates!)  When I ordered the liver, I told the waitress that I wanted it medium, to tell the cook to please not overcook it.  When it arrived, it was buried in a huge pile of deep fried onion pieces, with a few pieces of asparagus on the side, and plain mashed potatoes.  A small dish of what appeared to be gravy with chopped carrots in it was on the plate.  I tasted the gravy and it was overwhelmed with vinegar.  When I finally got the waitress's attention, I asked for some other kind of gravy that wasn't so sour.  She brought out a bowl of what looked exactly like what I had, sans carrots, and in tasting it, it was exactly the same.  I pushed it out of the way, and someone from the kitchen came out and after talking to him, he brought out another bowl of \""gravy\"" which was better, but still vinegary. \n\nAfter digging through the deep fried onions, I got down to a thick piece of liver, cooked to death and all but inedible.  I ate the asparagus which was perfect, and a couple of bites of plain potato, and left the rest.  When the waitress finally came back to our table, she asked if I was still working on it, and I said I couldn't eat any of it, because it was awful.  She took it away.  My friends finished their dinners, and we waited at least 15-20mins for our check, finally calling out to the waitress and asking her for the bill.  She brought me my bill for $28+ ( I had a beer), and when she came to collect, I said she should be ashamed for charging me for that meal, especially since it was obvious nothing had been eaten.  She said \""Why should I be ashamed\"", and took my credit card and rang it up.   My friends asked for coffee after our meal, and the waitress said she would have to make a new pot and it would take about 4-5 mins.  After waiting almost 15 mins, we left .   I should have called the manager or owner and complained to him, but I didn't.  I just decided it was lesson learned, and I would never go back.",857,0
Rotten place.  Smells of sewage and the manager runs around naked.  Fact.,19,0
"This place has huge portions, seriously, share. I had the Sage fried chicken and waffles. They were great, although the fried leeks were a strange flavor addition. Blood Mary's were perfect and very spicy. The prices are great. \nWhy would they get two stars then? \nOur waiter, Ricky, on 12/28/14 was high as a kite it seemed. I'm not sure what was wrong with the guy, but kept thinking he had made a mistake and then would come back and ask if he did it right. His eyes were glazed over and his speech was slurred. He introduced himself four or five times. \nHe got worried about splitting our bill three ways. \nHe had no idea that he had already brought our food properly. \nGet it together, Ricky.",173,1
"I was really excited to try this place when my wife said she heard about a new ramen joint that serves Hakata tonkotsu ramen.\n\nThe restaurant is minimalist with very little seating and is located next door to Raku. We generally don't sweat the decor, or lack thereof, as long as the food is good.\n\nThey offer shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu ramen and several other items on their menu. We ordered the tonkotsu, of course, which was $7 for a small-medium sized bowl. They used the thin white classic tonkotsu ramen noodles which were decent but lacked the elasticity or chewy \""freshness factor\"" of other places we've tried. As my wife will attest to, I like my food salty and flavorful, but their broth was a bit too salty, even for me. It had an earthy shiitake mushroom flavor but was lacking in the porky flavor and richness of a good tonkotsu broth. Neither of us cared to slurp up any of the broth once we were done with the noodles. I found the two pieces of chashu were mediocre at best. They were somewhat tough and fatty and had this unusual ring of gelatin around the edges.\n\nThis place is arguably the best ramen place in Vegas that we have found so far. Unfortunately that also isn't saying very much. A mere year ago, both of us would probably have been more than satisfied with Monta. Damn you Ichiran for making ramen snobs out of us and forever raising our ramen bar! The search continues for better ramen in Vegas...",329,2
"I haven't washed my dogs here, but I buy our pet food here.  The owners and staff are super nice, and they have a frequent buyer program.  There are a handful of items they don't carry (like specialty Greyhound coats), but I haven't seen a store yet (except on-line) that does.  Don't be dismayed at the huge, fat cats (they self-feed from the bags).  They might hiss at your overexuberent dogs, but they don't scratch.",111,4
"This is great experience if you have the finances to do it.  It's definitely a unique and memorable experience, but there are a lot of factors that go into making the experience wonderful.\n\nWe went on the Wind Dancer Air and Landing tour.  Our pilot, my date and I, and two other couples packed into a helicopter and took off over Las Vegas, Hoover Dam, and the Grand Canyon.  \nOnly two people can sit up front with the pilot at a time, the other two sit in back.  Make sure you sit in front for the FIRST half of the trip.  We got to sit up front and see the best view for the longest duration.  The other two couples switched off during the second half of the trip, so they only got to sit up front for 1/4 of the ride.\nEveryone wears a headset and you can hear what EVERYONE in the helicopter says. So just be aware of this.  This could be quite bothersome if you have Chatty Cathys on the ride who keep talking the entire time.\n  \nOur pilot was awesome and narrated the entire trip but also threw in his own personal remarks and sense of humor.  I can only imagine if we had a terrible pilot how horribly the trip could have gone.  We definitely got lucky in that aspect because out pilot was wonderful!\n\nWe landed in the Grand Canyon, had a glass of champagne and \""snacks\"" which ended up being sticky buns and pastries of the sort.  No thanks.\n\nOn the way back, we stopped to fuel (this is when the other two couples exchanged who sat up front).\n\nWe were allowed to take pictures the entire time.  They record the entire flight and audio and you can buy the footage afterwards if you want.\n\nOn the way back, we fly down the strip, which is a wonderful experience.\n\nAll in all, it was a really incredible experience.  Like I said, it really depends on your pilot and the other people on the ride how the experience goes, but it's definitely not something you get to do on a daily basis!",447,3
"It is so nice to have vegan alternatives and not be stuck ordering side salads everywhere. Just by having a place like this earns them the extra star from 3 to 4.\n\nMy friend ordered the sweet & sour tofu and said it was OK. Since we were hitting a bunch of restaurants this night, I didn't have a main course, but I DID get the \""tsoynami\"". \n\nSpeaking to the tsoynamis, they are delicious. Soy based ice-cream blizzard treats. I didn't realize how much I had missed milkshakes since going pescatarian, and this tasted like it came from Dairy Queen (I got the cookies-n-cream tsoynami). All the yummy goodness of a blizzard w/o any of the stomach aches, health issues, or moral issues (or whatever reason you've given up dairy). \n\nThe rest of the menu looks innovative and tasty and I wish we had more time in Scottsdale to try more items. \n\nIf you were to compare this to a non-vegan place, I don't know if it would rank as high. But, for what it is, this place seems to have found a niche and is doing it well.\n\n**things to note** This place is almost impossible to find. It is tucked away in a corner in a non-descript strip-mall (by a car dealership if I remember correctly). If I didn't have GPS, I would have given up on trying to find it. Also, the employees are all kinda dirty looking - expect hippy-types with dreadlocks and piercings and stretched earlobes. While I respect everyone's personal choices, I also appreciate hygiene in the people who are preparing my food... just sayin'....",374,3
"Ate here with a friend on a weekend in June 2012.  Food was ok, we were pretty happy with the service and the restaurant decor nice.  The waitress uniforms (traditional Thai dresses?) were a nice touch.\n\nJust like every(?) Vegas Thai restaurant I've been to so far, they have a great deal on weekday lunch specials.  Had I been there for that I probably would have given them 4-stars.",95,2
It's ok. I've come here and been wowed by the sushi then other times I can't really say either way. \n\nToday we had the miso soup and it was ok. Edamame was good though messing that up would take some work. Our teriyaki chicken is delicious and the turkey salad as well. Waitress is nice and so is everyone else.\n\nI'll give it two stars due to average food and environment. \n\nBtw everyone swears by the Godzilla tails which are just super small strips of chicken in what I liken to a buffalo sauce. Ehhh cheap if you ask me. But hey they work.\n\nI'll end with its worth a try:),153,1
"It's a Dollar Tree, so I really didn't have high expectations going in, and I'm wasn't overly disappointed.  It's loosely organized, mostly stocked, and staff are rare except to check out.  Not a big selection of items, but again it's a Dollar Store, not Target or Walgreens.  I don't typically shop here, and just went in with my wife looking for a particular item (large nail clippers), which they didn't have in stock at the time.  I do appreciate that they actually stick to the $1 price tag, versus other \""dollar\"" stores that do not.",134,2
"This shop is the place to go if you want to get herbal and all natural remedies. I alway stop in to browse whenever I am in the area. The staff are all very nice and will answer any questions you have. I am not big into the herbal remedies movement but I still like the all natural stuff. This place carries Burts Bees products which I buy especially the chap stick for the winter time. They also carry vitamin C drink packets which I swear by. Feel a cold coming on and start drinking tons of water with the assortment of flavours available and 50% of the time you will beat the cold before it gets full blown. Thats about as far as I take it with herbal remedies even though thats more of a vitamin remedy but close enough. Anyways stop into this shop , browse , and pick up whatever natural goodies you need because this place has been in business for over 100 years, they must be doing something right.",192,2
"This review is based off of one visit. Due to my first experience I unfortunately I won't be giving this place another try. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the rib eye hotpot (which was suggested as their most popular hotpot) and the Taiwanese popcorn chicken plate. The chicken plate was a lot more measly than expected. Chicken was good but not a fabulous chicken to rice ratio.\n\nWhat disappointed me most was the rib eye hotpot. Looked delicious and boiling hot when brought out. First of all there was no rib eye, but rather brisket. We were given non spicy when mild was ordered, although the waiter was very accommodating in bringing out extra spices for us to add to our liking. Never order the hot pot not spicy. It was the most flavorless soup ever. Tasted like water flavored by what was added into our soup (brisket, corn, imitation crab, squid, vegetables). VERY Minute amount of flavor even when we dumped in a whole bowl full of spiced oil and peppers. This lack of flavor was a huge turn off for me. \n\nService was exemplary though.. So a star for that!\n\nTLDR: hotpot lacked flavor. Was not tasty enough to try again any time soon. Good service.",263,1
"Interior designers will tell you that red can be a claustrophic colour.  \n\nNot so in the Virgin Lounge.  The stairs lead up to an open space, full of light and with carefully chosen branding.  \n\nA large bookcase holds a small library behind a grand piano.  A smiling....well, brand ambassador?  customer service person? - a smiling member of staff, in understated black and red takes details and chats about how the system is slow and she's hoping that feedback about this will result in changes to the process, as she's very sorry it's taking a while to find the correct details.  She offers that she will give us a tour and explain how the Lounge works but that, if we'd like to have a look around first, she'll have the card ready if we'd like to come back.\n\nUnfortuanely, the large model that echoes Virgin's current advertising has had an incident....not good timing for the front carriage of the tiny train to be in the fake water when that day's headlines were that Network Rail were to be sued over the Virgin Rail crash!\n\nLooking past this, however, the model is in the middle of a large room with cafe tables, and self-service counter, where members of the Lounge can help themselves to coffee, teas, soft drinks, pastries, biscuits etc.  This room is similarly light and airy, perfect for reading the paper, having a business meeting, or finding a space out of the madding crowd for lunch.\n\nThe main room, with its grand piano, selection of reading material and iMac terminals, also introduces large-backed, oversized armchairs where you can sit and read either one of the books, or one of the free newspapers, or any of the other reading material...I chose to browse through a Hip Hotel/Holiday book and, after I'd exhausted a flip-through, moved on to a Richard Branson business book.\n\nThe next room is a social room - more of the over-sized armchairs, a large TV, free iPads....the cosiest room but still filled with light and still carrying through the sublte branding and feeling of space and a hint of egalitarian, inclusive gentleman's club.\n\nThe customer service was excellent, friendly and observant without being intrusive; as I was leaving, the customer service person mentioned that not only could I take my copy of the Richard Branson book with me, but there would also be an updated version of the Holiday guide coming out, if I'd like to check for it next time I was in.\n\nOverall, it was a very solid first impression, suggestive of understated wealth, space and a certain level of comfort.  It is a great space - one that opens your ideas, rather than being at all claustrophic.",593,3

"Never ever use this company. Totally agree with the previous review. Simply, they try to charge for applications they never have done. At the end of season, they suddenly send multiple bills saying they are over due. Worse, communication with this company is a nightmare. \n\nI think that there is something wrong with the company (seriously). Someone at the company is making the application record up or cooking the book.",86,0
"Shame on me, I guess, for ordering Chinese food at a non-Chinese location.\n\nI wasn't really impressed with the Hong Kong noodles that I received.  The vegetable choice was a bit strange and everything was drowned in a thick gravy.  The noodles themselves were really soggy and not really crispy as I've typically found at Chinese restaurants.\n\nMaybe I'll have to come back and try some of the non-Chinese food.",96,1
"Ok, so my degenerate crew and I just got back from our favorite watering hole called Bill's Gambling Hall.  Once again the service and rooms were great.  We sauced our face off with Jager bombs and a 1000 beers (gratis ofcourse).  I had the shakes for a bit so I took a quick dirtnap in the room which was bed bug free I might add.  Good stuff.  Room was clean and nice, the only problem was they gave me and my ladyboy friend a king size bed instead of 2 queens.  Bummer, but we were so blasted coming home at 7am everyday, it didn't matter.  The dealers are outstanding and they bled money in our direction the entire weekend, which is nice to be taking instead of laying.  We have been coming to Bill's since the mid 90's when it was the Barbary Coast and the price, value, selection is perfect.  The only downfall is you have to bring beavers there otherwise you will have to take down an old bird and nobody likes that business.  Love this place.",234,4
Yesterday I sampled their egg sandwich and a chocolate croissant. Both were fresh & delicious & worth messing with my gps to get me there.  The guy behind the counter was also easy on the eyes as a nice bonus:) Cupcakes and cookies looked divine too but I was already in a bit of a butter & sugar coma after the croissant:),68,3
"We had tickets to KA and decided to get reservations at Nobhill since I've eaten at other Mina restaurants like XVI and have had good experiences plus I was missing my regional bay area cuisine.  Our show was at 9:30 and our reservations were at 7:45 giving us plenty of time to relax ... or so I thought.\n\nThe restaurant decor was very nice and the host told us right away that it was quite busy and that our table wasn't ready.  We waited about 15 minutes and the hostess gave us 3 glasses of complimentary champagne, which was a nice gesture given the wait.\n\nWe finally got seated and ordered a bottle of sumptous Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc and the rest of the wine list looked good.  We shared a small appetizer of truffle mac and cheese and one of my companions remarked that it was the best he's ever tasted. \n\nWe ordered two chicken and dumplings and I ordered the seafood cioppino.  This was at about 8:10PM and there were a lot of large groups because of the tradeshow we were attending.  We had informed the waitress that we had KA tickets and that we had to be at the show on time at 9:30.  Then the waiting started.  At about 9:00PM, the manager came by to let us know ours were coming out in a few minutes.  Then another 15 minutes went by and finally our food arrived at 9:15 giving us 10-12 minutes to eat.  \n\nI scarfed down my ciopinno and the fish was done well, rare in the center for tuna and well done for the salmon.  The scallop was a bit undercooked but the problem was the tomato broth that severely underseasoned and lacked in robustness.  This was especially needed since the seafood was not very seasoned so the dish tasted slightly bland.  My companions remarked the chicken was good but the dumplings were unevenly salted with some bites saltier than others.  \n\nGiven the significant wait time and nothing being done after serving our food (no discount or apologies), I can only give them 2 stars.  If there was no service issue, this would be a 3 1/2 star.",483,1
"I guess you either love this place or hate it. It's close, and has delivery, so the food is still hot when it gets here. That means I'll put up with a lot. I can also drive there quick and save the delivery fee & tip. They recently trimmed my wife's favorites and some of mine from the menu. No more Alfredo sauce or fish entries, along with some other stuff we used to get. Still get stuff from then when I'm on my own and don't want to leave the house. Never tried their pizza; I rely on the big boys for pizza & wings.",129,1
"Did this place close down? Please tell me I either missed it or they relocated because I love their food :(\n\nI decided to take a 4 mile walk in the sun because ironically, I was too lazy to drive, and I had hopes of eating here, but when I got there there was no restaurant!!\n\nI have been here 2 or 3 times before and have very much enjoyed the food. The service can be slow as I think the owner is the only one that works there, but he makes the food with so much care and love that I don't mind waiting at all.\n\nI am so sad.",137,4

"Have visited twice.  1st visit: Saturday midday for dim sum.- - Great variety, fresh food, good service.  Prices very reasonable.  2nd visit: late night on a Tuesday- - food still tasted fresh, loved the sizzling rice seafood soup.  I know I'll have a craving for that in the future.  To be honest this has been the only dim sum I've liked since moving to Las Vegas from L.A.  \n\nOverall: I'll definitely be back.  It'd be awesome if they updated the decor then you'd consider coming here for special occasions.",131,3
"Went for a wine and chocolate tasting as a guest and had a great time! \n\nThe father-son team buy the grapes as juice (layman's terms) and make their own (extremely) small batch wines. Literally, you could taste the same wine and have slight variation, monthly! \n\nWho wouldn't be inspired to witness these guys living their passion? It was fun! I wound up buying a couple bottles to support the cause. The wines are young (as you might imagine) but I'm looking forward to seeing how they age... who am I kidding? Not too long, of course! Just a couple weeks... \n\nCool tip: For under $450 you can make your own (their recipe, your custom label and modifications). You get about 27-28 bottles which would make super cool, unique holiday gifts!",185,3

Overrated and pricey!  I wanted chinese noodles but got soup instead.  The mexican dishes were very bland.  I immediately got a stomach ache from the food.

Meh.  My husband and I went to celebrate our friends anniversary and stayed 3 nights.  The desk staff was very friendly but the line for check in was s-l-o-w.

"This restaurant was recommended by the Conceirge in Mandalay and we were looking for a cool place to grab a bite not too upscale. This was it, tucked inside the Bellagio, right on the casino floor, there was this hip trendy place. \n\nThe one thing I notice it was not too secluded and could get quite loud from the floor of the casino since there was no wall and it was very dark inside. Still, the menu boasts some unique tastefully done dishes and some delicious cocktails. The service was friendly and the price was okay, not the best for the food you get. Scallops were delicious but the fried mac and cheese was the best! Pizza was sub par not great. In all not a bad meal. Not sure I would make this my first choice in Vegas though.",165,2

"Went here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Friday night. Costed us about $80+ with tip of course. Customer service was great! Very friendly staff and we were lucky to have a great server, Tony. \n\nThe food here was so-so flavor wise.  The food was fresh since we arrived right when they opened.  The red meats (steak, roast beef, etc) served were cooked perfectly (medium-rare to medium) but bland for my taste.  I felt the variety for entrees were a bit small.  The desserts on the other hand were delicious!  I think I will go back to try the food during brunch time and see if it's better than dinner.",149,2

We sat for a good 20 min talking, with the waitress stopping periodically to see if we were ready to order. We finally ordered and our food came out quickly. Asian chicken salad and bison burger. YUMMO!\nI enjoyed having a great server who allowed us to pace the meal. She did not hover around rushing us. It was lovely! She got a great tip for her patience with us!\nMy new fav spot!",166,3
"This place is horrible. I got a Groupon and probably went 4 class total. It's a total waste of money, even with the Groupon deal. What really upsets me is when they had Pro Motion pictures coming in to take pictures of your kid. The lady, I believe her name is Rachel Martin, asked everyone to fill and sign the release form. We aren't obligated to buy the pictures. Well, I decided to purchase an e-photo package (just digital copies via email) for $100. I called the studio right when I left (10 mins) to ask her to tell the photo company to cancel my order. This all went down 2 months ago and I'm still disputing this with my credit card company. Not only is this place overpriced, they're a scam with this Pro Motion pictures. \n\nNow onto their classes,\n30 minutes classes aren't enough time to get anything done after warmup and cool down. They have teenagers teaching this class btw....I understand they have a black belt and all, but if you're supposedly paying $150 a month with only 2 classes a week (that's the price they quoted me with), I expect more than that. You're better off taking your money to an mma gym where the classes are unlimited, and they are an hour long class. \n\nIf you're new, they need to help you achieve to the next level to get the color belt or whatever. All they do is let your kid go to class with the more advanced kids. They just gave me some paperwork and have my son practice at home. Well, what's the point of me taking him to karate class if they're not teaching him anything? How the heck I'm suppose to know what's a high kick, left block, etc? Anyway, I'm over this place. Lots of other places to take your kids to. I'd recommend an mma gym like extreme couture or syndicate. The reason why they offer so many groupon deals is because this place is just horrible.",438,0
This is my second visits to Carrabbas.\n\nNo reason I am mainly giving them three stars is because management seem to be uninterested and complacent about my comments in regards to the over-seasoned  and food.\n\n1) Ordered the crab-cakes as the appetizer. The plate was very unappealing and not presented well.  The crabcakes themselves had a good taste of crab. However they were very overseas and far too much salt and pepper. You could only eat half of one before it left an unpleasant taste in your mouth. How to keep drinking water\n\n2) Ordered The lentil soup with the meal. The soup had a great flavor with the Italian sausage. However they did not let the sausage and other ingredients flavor the soup. They added copious amounts of seasoning. Probably MSG. And the soup after 4-5 bites began to burn the mouth.  Needless to say we were unable to finish the soup as the seasoning overpowered the pallet.\n\n3) on a positive note. That 9 ounce sirloin was cooked very well. Had great flavor and was quite pleasing to eat.\n\n4) The saut\u00e9ed spinach with garlic was also cook very well. Not over seasoned... just the right amount of oil and the perfect amount of fresh garlic.\n\n5) also ordered the tilapia... The hazelnut crust is great. And the fish was well cooked. The big problem was that because of the hazelnut crossed the fish was very dry. The sauce was not enough and was heavily acidic with the lemon. While the fish itself was not over season. The lemon sauce was heavily over seasoned and not very tasty.\n\nWhat was really disappointing to me is that the manager came by and after telling her about the over seasoning problems she said that she would talk to her cooks but in the end it was not genuine. She continued about the restaurant and spoke to no one in the kitchen. \n\nThe manager also did not offer to re-cook any of our food and season it appropriately.\n\nAll in all it was a hit or miss. About 50% of our food was good and the other 50% was highly overseas and and really not edible.,467,2

"Purchased a Groupon for two person, two hour cleaning service.\nI was a bit concerned as I didn't receive any of the scheduling texts as mentioned when I scheduled online (nice plus).

3 stars for the food and fast service. But I'm pretty sure my friends and I got the Norwalk virus here. Minus at least one star for that! So that kinda was not fun for the rest of the weekend. The tot mash was great. But then we had lunch there and I watched a buser pick something out of our calamari bowl. Anyhow... Wish I could have given this more stars!

"I drove yesterday to a particular Chinese restaurant to have lunch since I was super hungry due to fasting for over 24 hours.  When I got there, I discovered I forgot my wallet and had to drive back to my office to get it.  Now I was really hungry so I went to Tao Garden which is half a mile down the street from me.\n\nSince I was super hungry, I actually ordered two lunches.  One was a big order of char siu chow funn (dry) with extra bean sprouts.  The other lunch was one of their lunch specials - beef bitter melon over rice (rice plate).  Both were excellent.  I think they had the sliced bitter melon soaking in a baking soda solution, since it was very bright green even after cooking and the portion of beef was pretty good too.  Both dishes were consumed in total by me -- albeit it was a little struggle, but I did finish both of my lunches.  \n\nStill pretty good Cantonese food for the price.",210,3
"I'm giving Copper Canyon 1 star because I don't want anybody else to know about this place.  Shhhhhh!\n\nBest/Truest greens in Phoenix...probably because nobody is willing to drive this far west to play.  This makes for a stellar putting experience sans unrepaired ball marks that seem to be all over most courses in the Valley (doesn't anybody repair their marks anymore?)  As always, Troon properties treat their guests well.  Personally, there is just something cool about walking up to the range to see a pyramid of balls waiting for you.  Not to mention the joy of having somebody pull your cart around while you get checked in.  Sure, these are tiny details, but for a guy that plays a lot of muni golf, it's the little stuff in addition to the conditions that truly separate the great courses. \n\nThe starter was very helpful, and went over the ground rules and recommended that we play the Combo Tees to maximize our enjoyment.  This shortened the par 5's and the longest par 4's while keeping everything else middle or on the back tees.  Great suggestion!\n\nFinally...Unlimited golf for $45.00 in the summer which included a burger for lunch.  Sure, there are cheaper options, but not many places can match the value of this place.  Just make sure you fill up the gas tank before venturing out to Southeast Las Vegas:)",302,0
"This place is sneaky!!  They do not tell you that they include a 15% tip on your total for the check already. No mention of that.  Our bill was $20 and some change, so my husband left a 4 dollar tip on the tip line and paid with a credit card. So I notice on our statement that it charged the $25 something and then a few days later, ran another $5 charge. So not only do they add on 15%, but they added it on to the total of what the bill was AFTER the tip he wrote in....so we paid another 15% of the bill plus the tip he wrote in.  WHAT?   I thought, what the hell is that????  And then I scanned some other reviews and saw that someone mentioned an automatic 15% tip added on. So beware of that and don't tip!!  Your bill already has it in there.\n\nOther than that I did enjoy the place and the Dim Sum is decent, though I have not experienced much to compare with. The decor is dark, dingy and sort of run down looking. The place is huge.  It's an adventure, and honestly, that part was fun, but the sneaky charges really left a bad taste in our mouths.",271,1

"I hate focusing on the negative and remembering the low points of the vacation, but the people has the right to know!  So here's what I think of Aria:\n\nCheck in - slow but expected and understandable - 30min\n\nRoom gorgeous - tasteful and modern.  The alarm clock, curtains, lights, TV and music were all controlled by an iPad type device beside the bed.  You are supposively able to check out with this pad as well, but the servies were down while we were there so we couldn't try it out.\n\nHousekeeping - poor, Upon check in, was hoping to lay down and rest, however there was a big white starchy stain on the comforter, stain was dead center in plain sight.  Disgusted, called Front desk to remove that and left to play a few games.  Came back, bed was remade but the same stain was still there.  Called again and had it redone.  We went to buy a few beers before returning to the room experience. \n \nService - poor, there is no bottle opener in the room, so I called to have one brought up.  Great.  Next day, room service removed the bottle opener, not sure why as I clearly had a few more beers on the counter.  Call for a new one.  20min pass, called back and room service said no record of one being requested.  10min later the bottle opener arrives.  40 min later, another knock on the door and a second bottle opener is delivered\n\nIn room dining service - poor, I preemptively ordered a fruit platter and chocolate covered strawberries to surprise my parents in another room.  2 weeks before our flight into vegas I called back to confirm that everyone was set up.  I was told there is no record of my order.  So, I reordered.  Upon arrival, there was nothing in my parent's room.  2 hours later the fruit platter and strawberries were delivered, but to MY room.  Went to the concierge to complain but she was not helpful.  Called front desk from my room to have this delivered to my parents room instead, in spite of ruining the surprise.\n\nCheckout - good, did it on the phone.",479,1
"First things first, the house special drink with iced milk slush, boba, pudding, and grass jelly is the only thing this place has to offer in my opinion. Other than that, service sucks and the other drinks are basic. Expect to wait 10-15 minutes for a drink with them being busy or not busy. This place has potential to be very popular, but it's just not there yet. I hope this place improves on their service and pace.",98,2
like other restaurants on the LV strip.. you're gonna pay a bit of premium.. nevertheless.. they pour a proper black and tan.. and their fish and chips are pretty damn good.. it's pricy.. but the food is solid.. they also have plenty of beers which is always a plus,62,3
This place is definitely one of the better restaurants in Las Vegas based on taste. Pricing is a little outrageous.  Food is cooked in lard which is what makes everything tastes great.  If I made my steaks with lard it would taste great too.\n\nAmbiance and service is 5 stars.,63,1
Such a great show. They gave free Jell-O shots. It was very funny and sexy. Definitely a must watch.,27,4
"I've been seeing Dr. Docasar for several years and I would put my life in her hands, which I've done once already.  She is very caring and sincere, listens to my concerns and makes wonderful recommendations of supplements that don't require a prescription.\n\nIt was Dr. Docasar that got my out-of-control fibroids under control several years ago by doing an ablation, even going out of her way to bring in a machine from out of state for the procedure.  The recovery time was really quick with very little pain.  I understand she's now able to do the procedures in the office.\n\nI'm currently undergoing painful menstrual cycles as my hormones are having a great time changing, and Dr. Docasar is working with me, discussing different options and providing an understanding ear.  It is very comforting to have someone I can trust so much that I've referred her to my sisters and friends.",198,4
"A coworker that is from just outside the city told me this was a must see while on vacation in Edinburgh.  She told me it was an interesting place so I made it a point to check it out.\n\nI saw the reviews before going and everyone said how it was uncomfortable and judgmental - but I didn't feel that way at all.  I thought everyone was really friendly and welcoming.  Even the cab driver on the way over made comments how the workers there can be really mean to people.\n\nMy boyfriend and I walked in but no one really acknowledged us.  i walked in a little further and a woman approached us and asked for drinks or food.  I said both and she sat us next to an older couple.  We said it was our first time at the place and she explained they didn't serve pub food and walked away after taking our drink orders and leaving menus.\n\nThe couple next to us, leaned in and made suggestions of what to order.  I ended up ordering the same meal she had and it was really delicious.  It was an open face sandwich and a hot potato on the side.  \n\nAfter dinner, I asked the manager if it would be okay if I took some pictures and she said yes.  She even gave me a packet that included the history of the pub and several postcards.\n\nI was really happy with my experience here.",295,4
"Maybe it was my high expectations going into dinner that caused such a let down, but truly it was the lousy food and average service.  \n\nOur meal started with margaritas at the bar, which for $8 each, were made with well/plastic bottle/cheapo tequila.  Not even (gag) Cuervo.  Or Sauza.  This was bottom bottom shelf tequila.  Triple sec?  Yep, same plastic bottle variety.  The sour mix was good though, couldn't tell whether it was fresh lime but not sickening sweet.  But $8?  C'mon, that's just robbery.\n\nLove the ambiance, and dig the chicano art vibe.  Servers were visibly not overly happy to be there, and I felt like there was the whole BS sales pitch on food/beverage. The whole \""Who's ready for margaritas?\"" line doesn't work buddy.  Had I not gotten mine from the bar, I would easily been turned off to not want to order one.\n\nWe ordered our meal, and the server provided a olive tapenade that I enjoyed, but served with cold cut bread?  Ok, so forget serving the obligatory mexican-american chips, but c'mon, must be something more interesting to serve.  Bread was cold and borderline stale.  \n\nOur meals came, and I ordered the Cochinita Pibil.  For me, this dish needs to evoke feelings of eating home cooked food in a \""warm your whole body and give you an endorphin rush\"" kind of way.  That was completely absent.  The pibil was served with 4 cold and dry corn tortillas (not homemade either) and was easily the saltiest thing I've ever eaten on a plate.  And for me, who is a salt lover, it was unbearable.  Maybe they can get away with serving such crummy pibil because people have never had good pibil?  I don't know.  \n\nGirlfriend's tilapia was good, as was my dad's mole negro enchiladas and my mom's pollo poblano.  Not 5 stars good, however.  The mole had too much chocolate for my liking as it was very sweet and had too much cinnamon.\n\nThe potato mash they served on the side was tasty.  Probably one of my favorite things about the meal.\n\nMy rant will end with this:  enough with chicken breast.  Yeah, I get it, trying to be \""upscale\"", but for the love of Foster Farms, serve a whole leg with your mole.  Dark meat is delicious and for me should be served with your homey rich sauces.\n\nOh, and for the reviewer that said this was actually located in the barrio - go spend some time down in Guadalupe.  This is not the barrio.  At all.",609,1
"Lavo our go to place for free drinks and the royal treatment!! Located in the Palazzo Hotel this nightclub is the best place to pre-game for drinks or a place to unwind from a wild night. \n\nBouncers and promoters are alway chill and quick to lend a hand to groups of girls. Luckily, we had help from a few promoters to get our night cracking! Leading up to Lavo you walk a small balcony over looking the dining area. Its cool how they have open sinks on the balcony leading to Lavo. The nightclub itself is small. Nothing to grand about that the place. Its plain with nice interior design. \n\nIf you catch yourself going early sometimes they have free drinks for ladies. An even added plus is when the promoters have free drink tickets and then forsure the drinks will be coming your way.  The bouncers themselves are very nice. They even help you up on the ''stage'' to dance. the dancefloor is small.. real small but I have found that it doesn't get to crowded like other nightclubs. \n\nWhat I most like about Lavo is that it is not to crowded. Its not overwhelming like other larger venues and it is nice that you can just chill and hangout.",259,3
"Gosh I was hoping for more here. The vibe and happy hour make it a worthwhile stop but the food and drink was disappointing and actually left our stomachs unsettled.  Their house margarita was so bitter and acidic that after one sip I stopped drinking it. A good stir did not help. It also had an off-putting 'refrigerator flavor'. Not a good start. I had the veggie stack which was not a stack at all but more of a pita spread with hummus, and a scattering of very fresh veggies and some  black quinoa,  and (the best part ) green goddess dressing. The pita was like thick piece of cardboard and my first bite had a nascent fishy taste and I swore mustard I tasted mustard which I would have asked them to hold, not a fan of that stuff. I decided to see if it improved but that pita was too much work even with the sharp serrated steak knife provided. The side dish of fried okra, my grandmother used to make this, wasn't worth the calories. It was reminiscent of something you would buy in the frozen section of your grocery store; tough, cold and a bit bitter as well.  The dip was good though. My husband ordered the crab BLT, which the server promised, \""the crab cakes were flown in fresh every day.\""  Should have caught 'crab cakes' because they tasted old and again like something you would get from your grocer's freezer. The side of coleslaw was very good though and a fresh take on the standard gloppy mix.  \nI'll try again because of the vibe and try to be more selective about what I order.\nAnd  I'll stick to wine.....",342,1
"If I could give a negative star rating, I would.\n\nHaving been familiar with the SLS brand in LA, the bar was set high for SLS Las Vegas.  \n\nWe booked our evening the second day of business.  With reasonable expectations of the property not running perfectly, we aimed to just explore/enjoy the property for 24 hours.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION:\nUpon entering the driveway, we approached the valet person blocking the main entrance circle  -- we told him that we were checking in.  He told us to park in the garage. There was no way I was going to rough it and drag good luggage (100+ degrees) through the old Sahara parking lot and deal with Sahara faulty elevators.  So, we circled around again and noticed other people driving right up to the front entrance and unloading.  Gee, was a Range Rover not front entrance worthy?  I pulled in hot. Upon reaching the main entrance, valet unloaded and parked our car.  TIP: If you are unloading at the front entrance, you need to have the bellman take your bags, otherwise you will drag your bags across carpeted floors with heavy flows of people (assuming SLS survives) as the checkin desk is on the other side of the property. Also take a photo of your bags on the bellman cart.  The lack of organization makes you wonder if all your belongings will actually ever make it to your room.\n\nONE STAR:\nThe one star is for bringing back the bright white entrance that actually makes you feel like you are on vacation for a hot minute.  The allure lasts about five steps though .  You walk on to this cool illuminated surface then step down into a casual \""Cannery\"" casino atmosphere. By the time I took my first step onto the dreadful casino floor, I said \""wow, this is not what I was expecting\"".  This isn't a place where you style your best threads.  The exposed ceiling really diminishes any possibility of sophistication.  Additionally the lighting designers missed the mark -- it is depressingly too dark. Seriously it feels like you are under ground.  The restaurants are pockets off the casino floor -- meaning you are exposed to the smoke and noise.  The 24 hour restaurant should have been twice the size -- like other resorts.  TIP: Use OpenTable for reservations and pray they get you in on time and pay attention to notes. Stressful.\n\nCHECK IN\nThe checkin desk is in the same location as the original Sahara, however, it is unmarked and has no line organization or hotel ambassador.  You have to be on the watch to make sure someone doesn't just walk up to an open attendant, while you are waiting 20 mins or longer to check in. Stressful.\n\nTHE ROOM\nOld Sahara small, interesting approach but sadly sterile feeling.  Glass shower exposed to the main room is passe' and cheesy.  Really, like anyone is going to get sexy at the  Cannery, I mean SLS?  Can't you just present a tasteful room where you don't have to wonder if an orgy took place the night before?  \n\nWe did know that housekeeping was there as cleaning agent bottles were showcased on the desk and snacks and liquor were missing from the mini bar.  Speaking of snacks, we wondered about room service offerings.  No menu.  Shortly after* someone did leave two sheets of paper STAPLED together in our \""lux-high floor\"" room.  *The \""shortly after\"" involved me going to the front desk to report the missing items and inquire about room service, because NOBODY answers the phone in any department. TIP:  Take photos of your mini bar and room.\n\nFOOD: UMAMU BURGER\nMy friend was dying to try Umami Burger.  He ordered a burger that is to come with a beer cheese sauce.  BUT he asked for the beer cheese on the side because he wanted to make sure that he liked it.  The server returned to our table and said \""the kitchen won't serve you the beer cheese on side because it melts when placed on the burger\"". As a chef myself, I said, \""soooooo can't the kitchen heat a ceramic ramekin and put the cheese in it?  \""NO\"", said the waiter.  Since this can't be done, I will assume they serve plastic cheese.  They also just lost a customer.  Truthfully, the burger was no different that any burger you can get on the strip.  TIP:  If you want a good burger in Vegas, go to BLT at the Mirage. Fabulous.\n\nWe checked out of this resort after the UMAMI burger meal.  \n\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!\nUnless you know the secret valet recovery location (tucked away in a place you would think only employees are permitted) you will never get your car back.  If you are handicap, too bad.  You are on your own because valet doesn't answer the phone either.\n\nNO HOUSE PHONES\nIf your cell phone is low, CHARGE IT.  I was told by an engineer that no house phones have been installed yet.\n\nPOSITIVE REVIEWS\nPlanted reviews are very obvious.\n\nI respect their intent, however, the interpretation in print and on the web missed the mark.",1129,0
I may or may not give these guys a second chance. No draft beer was available when I was there because their draft system was broken.  The selection of draft beers looked o.k. nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked. If a place is calling itself a brewery at least try and have some real beer. The worst part though was the food... $6 for a fried bologna sandwich? Are you kidding me? Cute names on the food but poor execution.,95,1
"Was here 9/11/09 staying at PH. \n\nWe were with a group of 7: 4 guys and 3 girls. Our host informed us to meet at the Halo Bar in the Miracle Mile shops between 10:00PM and 10:30PM. We were told it would be no cover for the ladies and guys were $50.00, which included table and bottle service. After standing around for about 45 minutes, waiting for another group, we were told the plans had changed and guys would not allowed to sit at the table, they had to pay just $10.00 cover to get in and the ladies would still be free with table/bottle service. \n\nAnother 30 minutes goes by before our host gives up on the other group and we head in to supposedly get into the club. The VIP line is as long as the line for the general public. As our group is waiting to go up the escalator a mob of \""other VIPs\"" splits our group up and some of us get in, some of us are waiting at the bottom of the escalator and others are still on line behind the rope. Luckily as I headed upstairs I got a stamp on my wrist. \n\nAt the top there are three more lines to wait in and a cash box for cover. We were informed guys were $30 and ladies were $20 after 11:00PM. The only reason we were arriving \""after 11:00PM\"" was because we were waiting on our host. Naturally, our host has been detained downstairs and isn't there to explain our \""status\"". They let me and the other girls in free as we had stamps. They cut the guys wrist bands off and charged them $30 a head. At least we're in. \n\nI look around and I am astounded the line was so long for this place. It's half empty and every table has 10-15 girls sitting (not dancing) at it. Maybe 12 guys in the whole place. The music is a weird throwback mix of 90's Top 40/R&B. Out of no where our host appears and explains that since the guys already paid it's too late but he can let the girls sit at a table and drink for free. So much for guys not being allowed at tables; it was a sausage fest at the table with \""free Skyy for VIPs\"". I was able to use my feminine wiles to snag drinks for myself and a few others in our group. An unlucky one was stuck paying $14 for a Corona that was poured into a plastic cup. By about 12:30AM the vodka just \""ran out\"" and was not replaced and there was no explanation. \n\nThe club itself was laid out very strangely and the headliner never showed. All in all I would not come back here. Rain, Tryst and Tao are much nicer Clubs, minus the drama just getting in the door.",651,1

"Truly one of the worst buffets I have ever eaten at. Went in with an open mind and I have no problem giving 4 or 5 stars when it is warranted, even for a buffet, but this place barely qualifies for 1 pitiful star. I would give it ZERO stars if it was an option. As someone who loves asian food, this buffet made me feel so sad for the total lack of flavor and passion by those who prepared the food at this sorry excuse for a chinese buffet. Case in point, raw jalapeno pepper in a sushi roll and breaded chicken that was so black it looked like a piece of coal. WTF? Would not be suprised when Lin Buffet is on Dirty Dining. Do not go here! AWFUL AWFUL!!",157,0
"One thing I love about the corporate restaurant model is that service is often reliably better than the local places.  This is true at On the Border.

They told us they would fix the situation the next morning.  Of course, the next day being a saturday (who checks out on a saturday?) they were unable to fix our room.  So I complained to guest services, and the guy was rather nice.  So they in fact \""upgrade\"" us to the HRH-all suite tower.

"This is a review for mostly the service, but the drinks are still not up to the standards of what you'd expect from such a well known franchise. It's popular in Montreal mostly because it's the only place to get a quick bubble tea. The cashier lady is rude and her attitude just makes me never want to spend 5 bucks on their drink ever again. First of all i asked for 1/3 sugar, and she rudely told me \""no we don't do that only 20th\"", to which i said fine. Even though i found it odd since all Taiwanese chain stores do 1/3, 1/2, 4/5, and 5/5 sugar. I know because I've lived in Taiwan most of my life and I've asked for the same drink at almost all bubble tea stores in Canada and USA. When I received my drink it wasn't 1/5 sugar instead it was 120% sugar! I went to the guy making the drink to notify that they made a mistake and their first reaction was...\""it's not our fault you must have done something wrong.\"" I told them I asked the lady first for 1/3, but she said they didn't have that only 1/5. She heard me and she retorted \""I did not tell you that, i said 120th and we only do 1/3 sugar not 1/5\"".

The technician seemed to make it her goal to make me feel awful about my skin, even when I politely reminded her that I was there to relax.

"McCarran is unlike most airports in the world. First, you can gamble on slots at every gate and terminal. You can also smoke in designated places, usually a room near the slots. The baggage claim area is huge, with perhaps 18 carousels, and large video screens and full color signs showing you all the entertainment options in town. Its quite a show right there. The taxi stand has a long line and marked pick-up stalls of at least 30. The newest major change in the past couple of years is the new off-site rental car center, where all the main companies are located about a 10 - 15 minute ride south of  the airport. The other thing about this airport is that it is right near the main Strip, so you can see the gleaming gold buildings as you land. However, it can take you 30 minutes or more to go the 3 to 5 miles to get to your hotel due to traffic congestion. \n\nThis airport has expanded many times. However, with close to 50 million passengers per year through here, it is still bursting at the seems. Beware that lines can be very long, especially through security and especially on big getaway days like Sunday and Monday. Plan to get here early then. It can take you 15 minutes past the airport to drop off your rental car, another 15 minutes for the ride to ther terminal, another 15 minutes to find your counter and check in, another 15 -20 minutes to get to security, another 5 - 10 minutes to take the train to your gates (if you are out on C or D concourse) and another 5  mintues to find your gate.

I felt the buzz half way through my dinner, but I couldn't taste the alky at all.\n\n(Club reviewed in different section.)",128,2
"Well the name \""skinny\"" doesn't actually refer to the healthiness of their dishes, which is a little unfortunate for them because it could be a good niche and make up for the poor service. The place is cool looking, very trendy and upscale-ish. The service is really bad. I came here on a Friday for lunch and it was pretty deserted. Took FOREVER to get someone to come take our order, after minutes of trying to make eye contact with every server in the place. Food came, then it took awhile to get the bill and then took a very long while to get the card swiped and returned. The food itself is fine. The menu is pretty standard - salads, apps, pastas, normal Italian dishes like something-parmeson, etc. I had the argula salad which was very yummy. \n\nI can see this place being good for a date night, when you can be very leisurely about your time.",195,2
"The Fremont Street Experience has turned into a dump of nothing more then street beggars, drunks, homeless and thieves.  Not children friendly at all as it is very dirty with a host of inappropriate street performers.  There are so many other places to spend your money!\n\nI will never go there again.",66,0
The food was just out of this world and the server Daria was the best grade A+ all around thank you for a great breakfast I'm full okay later,33,4

"Worse company ever!  They were supposed to fix my dishwasher but said I needed a part that they did have but would come back to replace.  Next thing I know I get a call saying that the repairman will be at my home in 20 minutes.  After 40 minutes, I called them and they told me that the repair guy had already been there and that I missed my appointment.  They said that he left a sticky note (there was none).  They said that he rang the door bell (he didn't).  I had four adults and two dogs in my house all day; if anyone comes near the door they will bark.  But guess what... we were all home.  No one came.  Now they want to reschedule my appointment for 10 days later than the original date.  \n\nDon't use them ever.  They will collect your deductible and get it cashed immediately and then not fix your machine for weeks!",204,0
"*My 200th Review*\nTarbell's, you were a dream come true!\n\nThis is what 5 stars is to me-\nThe very best service. Every staff member was professional, personable, well groomed, prompt, and smiled often!\n\nThe restaurant itself was simple and elegant. Definitely a place I would recommend for a date or special occasion or anytime you want to be fancy! \n\nThe crowd was mostly retirees, but I took that as a sign that I was in the right place.  The other diners were very dapper and able bodied and seemed to clearly enjoy the finer things in life. \n\nThe food. Mmmmmm yes!! I had the scallops, and they were the best I've ever had. It came with a potato cake and seasonal vegetables, each bite equally delicious. The salmon was also excellent and grilled to perfection. Even the grill marks were absolutely perfect, which I admire because I can not do that myself! It was accompanied by mixed greens with an amazing honey glaze dressing, and potatoes another way- similar to shoe string pik nik sticks but much fancier and salty and mouth watering. We shared the caramel cheesecake for dessert, and that was probably the low point of the meal. Kidding!! Omg, I rarely eat dessert and this was worth.every.calorie!! Perfection! Not to sweet, not too dense, not too light, so full of flavor! The caramel sauce! My, my! I really can't wait to go back. I am very curious about the spaghetti and meatballs! And the profiteroles! I want to try the whole menu, each time it changes! \nThank you Tarbell's, for making my 30th birthday dinner amazing!\n\nEdit: I received a warm phone call from Ty 2 days after dining to inquire how my experience was. I can't say that has ever happened before even at other fine establishments. Very classy. Thanks Ty!",412,4
"I came here on a Friday night with family to try out their Hibachi cooking since it's near by.  I've been to other near by Japanese Hibachi style restaurants, but I have to say that Ohjah kicked some butt and is at the top of my list.  The salad dressing was delicious and the entire meal was yummy.  I especially enjoyed the Udon noodles and the fresh vegetables.  I was not a huge fan of their onion soup; it was a bit salty and the breaded onion pieces inside looked like it came from a can of crispy onions.  All and all the service was great and the chef preparing our meal was hilarious and very entertaining.  It is a good size restaurant with a private room for dining.  The decor is nice and it has a great vibe.  I hope this plays sticks around because I will definitely be back to try their sushi bar and other menu items.",189,3
"Probably won't be back, food was ok except for the fact we Didn't receive all our food. Even though the manager comped our cold food this was only due to the fact we stopped him And asked for him to come over. Just was a little upsetting after waiting 30 min for a table, 30 min for our food which we only received 1/2 our order. Another plate came 15 min later and our last plate never came. We let the waitress know that we don't want the plate anymore we get a reply ok good.  Hmmm if you don't mind poor service and taking the chance of your food not showing  then go here. There was other things wrong as well like the general manager sitting there laughing and chatting away with the head chef while he texted for 10-15 min and the kitchen we were told was very backed. I don't know about them but if I was the manager and head chef I would be back there trying to do everything I can to get us caught up. Just very disappointing",222,0

"Went here last night and I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the food.  We started off with the zucchini fries and pretzels with different sauces.  The honey mustard sauce with the pretzels and the 'boom boom' sauce with the zucchini fries were my favorite.  I wasn't very hungry, so just got the grilled Buffalo salad, which was very good; love the dressing.  Everyone's meals looked great. Wish I wasn't full going there or I would have stolen from their plates.  I would like to try the pimiento cheese appetizer next time.\n\nThe dirty martini was perfect and the Leroy's lemonade was great - love any drink that comes in a mason jar.  The atmosphere was very loud and there were a lot of kids there, so this will be a family night out type of restaurant going forward, vs. dinner with friends/sans kids.  Our waitress was fantastic - knowledgeable about everything on the menu, friendly and very accommodating.   Will definitely be one of our go to restaurants when we go out with the kids.",218,3
"Went here for lunch to meet with a friend who was in town for the day. This was during the week, and there as a pretty good crowd there. we were seated and took advantage of their lunch specials (if I remember correctly, they have a good variety of lunch combos for $10). I had the kung pao chicken, on a 9/10 spiciness level. My friend had the chicken pad thai, I think 8/10 hot. Our food didn't take long to come out, and I was surprised at the meat - rice ratio (more meat than I thought). The only bummer was that the chicken was hardly spicy at all, but it did taste great. As far as the service, it was fine until it took about 15 minutes for us to get our check, as the server didn't even come near our table to check on us. Would I go back? Probably",191,2
"First time at the fest so we were really excited to learn about the wines, enjoy some music and taste some food. We purchased the more expensive VIP tickets at $35 instead of the regular entry of $25 which allowed for a special, entry barred tent and cheese snacks, as well as a seating area. Vast improvement is needed here to warrant charging the extra fee.\n\nThe location of the VIP tent was a mystery, it was not on the map, and when I asked two different workers, they had no idea where it was. Once we stumbled on it, located near the front side by the mall so, you couldn't even hear the music from the band shell about a 1/4 mile away.\n\nAs others have written before, people don't really know how to conduct themselves so everyone can enjoy the experience.  If people would wait their turns and not be pushy, the experience would be so much more enjoyable.\n\n*FYI* It is not a place to get drunk -though the price tag may imply that. The smartest people brought blankets to sit on, purchased bottles of wine and enjoyed the music.",239,1

"easily one of the WORST Vegas hotel experiences I've EVER had.  booked a room with 2 queens.  called 1 week prior to trip to confirm over the phone that I would be getting a room with 2 queens since I'd be traveling with 2 young children.  everything was confirmed.  rep assured me they'd have a room w/2 queens bed ready for me.  come check in time at mid night, front desk was unfriendly and proceeds to tell me they ran out of rooms w/2 queen beds.  asked if they could put me in terrace room with 1 king and they'd bring in a double rollaway.  fine.  get up to the room, they bring in a single rollaway.  maid service informs me it's against fire code to have double rollaways in room.  so either front desk rep lied or didn't know his company's policy.  I call front desk to inform them that the single rollaway would be too small to fit both me and my wife.  the manager, anthony tells me I can sleep on the couch.  then threatens me that he should be charging me additional occupancy fees for individuals in excess of 2 adults.  I educated him that on Cosmo's website, the policy is to charge for adults in excess of 2.  add occupancy fee does not apply to children.  he says he'd never heard of that before.  another example of staff not knowing company policy.  spent another 10 mins on the phone with Anthony trying to understand why they couldn't fulfill my original reservation and all I got was \""I can send someone with sheets for you to sleep on couch.  finally at 2am, I gave up.  not impressed with hotel.  even less impressed with hotel staff and service provided.  will never stay here again. for manager Anthony, see your company's policy below.\n\n\""ADDITIONAL PERSON CHARGES\nMaximum occupancy is four persons per room.

"Been here many times always for a Dbacks game. I really like the stadium itself, I've never had a bad view of the game even when getting the cheap sets. As usual the food is stupidly expensive but its what people have come to expect as part of the experience. The fans add to the luster or in this case, the lack of luster of the stadium. The Dbacks fans seem sedated, the only ones cheering are the opposition team's fans,which come out in droves and have always outnumbered dbacks fans. It doesn;t have the electricity of a Wrigley field or a Busch stadium, but its still a good place to go to watch a ball game...especially if you cheer for the other team!",151,3

"Bummer of a hotel.  Definitely not up to par with the Crowne Plaza name, and previous locations I've haunted.\nThis place is OLD.  It used to be a Holiday Inn Holidome in the 80's.  They've remodeled the \""dome\"", turning it into a gathering area with an indoor pool in the middle.  \nThe first room I received faced the pool, and it was OK, but it smelled like a giant fart.  For some reason, I had no cell phone signal whatsoever.  The \""high-speed\"" internet in this hotel is slower than dial-up, and disconnects regularly.  It's not wireless, so you have to use the 14\"" cord they bring to your room, limiting your computing area to the desk in the room.  \nI asked to be moved to an outside-facing room, as I learned that when I walked out to the parking lot, my cell phone signal magically re-appeared.  My new room had two double beds, rather than the king I had, but it smelled fart-free, and my phone worked great.  I was much happier, save for the horrible internet.  It's complimentary, so I got what I paid for.\nThe business center had a broken laser printer, and I needed to print some documents in a hurry, so they logged me into the concierge / bell desk computer, which had an inkjet printer from 1986.  It printed 10 of the most horrible documents I've ever witnessed.  \nThe gentleman who checked me in helped me with the printer as well, and was very accommodating (no pun intended) during my stay.  \nBy the way, if you don't like the smell of chlorine, avoid this place, as the indoor pool in the middle of the hotel makes the entire place reek of it.\nI had dinner and a couple of drinks in the bar one night, and it was quite good, too.  However, I don't think I could bring myself to stay here again.",437,1

"Undecided between 4 and 3 finally I am giving a 3 stars. Somehow it failed to impress me and I have been to a number of mexican restaurants in several countries. I must say that the prices are high for mexican food and I am not used to that. The spiceness was not really rich and food was decent to quite good , but not special at all. I happened to see the cooks inside the kitchens and they were british-looking youngsters. \n\nThe starters mix was pretty good buy costed 1 pound per small bite! The mains were nice, but half filled with salad (75% shredded letuce, and ocassionally a cucumber slice, peas, and cheap grocery things) Not even a piece of  jalapeno or a chili pepper. On the other hand, the steak and chicken were great and the sauces were very good (but not very spicy despite I ordered a medium not mild spiceness). \n\nThe waiters and their service was excellent, and the Sangria pitches was very nice. The room (floor down) was smally giving a quite atmosphere and the lights were dim and golden. It was very comfortable and warm, so the experience was very good.\n\nAll in all it is an OK Mexican restaurant, and you would get a mexican type of food, but it failed to impress me compared to the mexican restaurants I am used to. I would give it another try in the future.",299,2
"If you've walked down Murray Avenue in nice weather, you've surely seen Paititi's wares blowing in the breeze. They've got a prime location, and their gorgeous women's clothing catches my eye (and pull me into the store more often than not) on a regular basis.\n\nThey have a top-notch selection of scarves on display, including the popular Pashmina fabric. They also have the more-hippy, flowy scarves in every variety of colors and designs. I also appear to have a weakness for their jewelry. Most (or all?) is hand-crafted, and I feel like every time I buy a scarf, I come out with a pair of earrings to match. I'm super rough on my jewelry, and even though the earrings I've bought are handmade, they have stood the test of time, and the test of me tossing them into suitcases and pockets while traveling.\n\nAlthough I personally seem to stick to the scarf and jewelry wall, they do have a ton of other items too, including summer dresses and soft fuzzy things made of alpaca fur. They do accept credit cards, but I think they prefer cash if you can, especially if you're just getting a small-cost item (and prices are really, REALLY reasonable, often with sales on a purchase of multiple scarves).\n\nAnd now, after writing this, I am totally planning the next time I can get up there and pick out a new scarf.

"My girlfriend and I went to Vegas, and decided to eat at the Heart Attack Grill, which I regretted.  First off, it's cash only, secondly, the quality / flavor of the food is the worst I've had.  How hard is it to screw this up? Seriously? It's a burger / hot dogs and fries place... how can it be bad? How do you mess that up? This place expects to stay in business based entirely on notoriety, I.E. the shock value of eating here.  The hamburger had no taste whatsoever, I suspect it was grade B beef. The bacon looked and tasted like it was cooked days ago, then put under a heat lamp.  I will give them one point - the chili had some flavor,  but the fries like many here have stated were not good. I ate a very large hot dog, and half an order of fries at 1:00pm, and then was throwing up at 6:00 that evening, and couldn't eat again until 11:00pm. It ruined my whole Saturday.  My girlfriend didn't feel well after eating here either.",242,0
"Absinthe is a great 90 minute show.  The acts are quite dazzling and daring--strong men doing amazing lifts and balancing, a roller skating couple, aerial act, and much more.  Think V Variety Theatre meets Zumantiy, with a zany MC, the Gazillionaire, and his peppy sidekick, Penny.\n\nWhen I entered the beer garden area, open to the public, I was intrigued by the decor or lack thereof.  Bathtubs made into seats, assorted lights and letters to spell the name of the beer garden, whimsical lights--it has a little of everything.\n\nIf you know someone who can get you a VIP ticket, take it.  I was VIP last night.  You get to enter a private lounge.  Access is through a green telephone booth.  Once you show your ticket, you step into the booth, pick up the phone, and when someone on the other side picks up, say anything you want.  He'll let you into the VIP area.  There's another bar in there and you get 1 free drink ticket with the VIP seating.  I had a great time chatting with people from out of town.  And, it's a relaxing area decorated in an eccentric manner a bit muted compared to the outside garden.\n\nVIP ticket holders are allowed into the circular building first, so this guarantees you the seat of your choice.  I took a front row seat, and it was great.  Being the 3rd person in the theatre has its perks.  I was also \""picked on\"" by the Gazzilionaire a bit.  All in good fun and for lots of laughs--no lap dance from Penny.\n\nThe acts are dazzling.  The performers are very talented.  The show is almost exactly 90 minutes.  The seats are wood, so they begin to feel uncomfortable after awhile.  They are also hooked together with lock ties so you can't get a bit more room from your neighbor.  This is because the stage is relatively small and the performers are coming in and out through small aisles.\n\nI highly recommend this show.  What an addition to the lineup of shows in Las Vegas.  At $69 before taxes and fees, this show is less expensive than many on the Strip.  Go and enjoy!",489,4

"This \""steakhouse\"" was so bad, it made me question the integrity of some of the awards thrown around in this town. I heard that it was closing this sunday and now I know why. First of all, the quality of product is so cheap. Lavosh that was set upon bread service was inedible due to so much salt. Maybe the clientele is so old, they're taste buds don't notice. Ordered a few sides, mac n cheese was mediocre at best but best thing we ordered all night. Among appetizers, the calamari was rubber. Not just \""rubbery\"", Thick cut and overcooked, then piled into a deep bowl so it steams itself as it sits. Horrible. The crab cakes were cold inside and flavorless. My steak was not seasoned at all, and I took two bites before I asked for the check. Never was my table touched or anyone asking why we did not eat more than two bites of anything. Service is worse I've had since I left a Philadelphia diner at 2am ten years ago. Very sad place with no feeling of a classy \""old school\"" steakhouse. More like everyone gave up. Best business decision for EC is to close this cult followed abomination. two stars because you don't say bad things about people on their funeral. Good riddance to the flame...",275,1

"I checked this place out with a business client of mine the other day after seeing the various yelp reviews about it. The interior design is very cool inside and welcoming. Staff is friendly and engaging. They have outlets at the booths that are convenient for laptops and getting work done.\n\nFood: My friend had the MTO breakfast platter. According to him it was good. Bacon was cooked perfectly. Although for the price, I was expecting a larger portion size. I got the chicken in a waffle dish. It was good, but I wasn't in love with it. Once again price was a little steep for what you get. There's a lot of great breakfast places in town where the food is spectacular, the portions are large, and the price is cheaper. \n\nOn a side note there Mashed potato Hash browns are really really good and unique. Unfortunately I found a piece of hair in them.........

"My bill goes to CenturyLink in Phoenix, but that's likely just a billing center, so I'll write my experience here.\n\nI switched to CenturyLink for only home internet at the urging of a DirecTV customer service agent when I called into them to cancel/save on my bill. I was offered a \""bundle\"" discount through DirecTV for using CenturyLink for my home internet. I previously had Cox internet and was fine with the price, the service, etc. I switched because it was going to save me around $15 on my DirecTV bill and was about the same price as my internet with Cox was ($39/month).\n\nOur home internet was installed/connected by a tech on Sept 16, and she was professional. Unfortunately that's when we were told that our perfectly good, nearly new Zoom router was not \""compatible\"" with CenturyLink's DSL. I was never told that on the phone. She informs us that they can either charge us about a $6/month router rental fee or we can buy it for about $100. OK, whatever.\n\nInternet is working, seems about as fast as they said it would be (10 MB/s downlad speed). HOWEVER, when I get my first bill it was not the approximate $150 I expected ($45 for Oct-Nov pre-billed, about $35 or so for the partial month of service in Sept, the $60 installation fee DirecTV  informed us of, and any applicable taxes). NOPE, it was for $184.48. They charged us MORE for the partial month of service (Sept 16-Oct 8) than for the full month of service! \n\nI called into them to inquire, waited 12 minutes and after about 2 minutes of actual discussion with a customer service rep the call was abruptly disconnected. I was sitting still in my house, with full signal on my phone. WTH? I call back, wait on the phone again for about 10 minutes, and I get another rep so I have to start my story all over. She is in the midst of going through the charges (rather ineffectively) and explaining why it was so much (she confirmd that yes, they don't \""discount\"" partial months when they prorate them, which is why my first 23 days of service actually cost MORE than the full 30 day month did...how does that make any sense?!) The call disconnects again!!! Note that once again, I have full signal, full battery and was completely stationary during the call.\n\nI immediately call DirecTV, get someone after only about 3 minutes of waiitng and surprise, surprise: I talk to him for about 10 minutes with NO issues of the call dropping. Clearly it was CenturyLink's phones that disconnected. Luckily, the agent at DirecTV was at least sympathetic to my concerns and troubles with the two dropped phone calls, so he said he'd put in a request for them to look at my inquiry and call me back in the next few days. Nothing so far and it's been one week.\n\nI have worked out to the penny what I think my bill should be ($151.25) and once I do get ahold of someone at CenturyLink, I intend for them to adjust this or I'll be opening a complaint with the BBB and likely cancelling my DirecTV simply because they talked me into switching to CenturyLink.\n\nI'll keep you all posted on things...wish me luck!",759,0
"This was the 1st place to grab a bite when we got to Vegas.  We were planning a big dinner so just wanted a snack.  That's certainly what we got - not very large sushi rolls for $17.50 but at least we didn't overeat.  \n\nThis is the problem I have....the sushi chefs were making different size sushi.  Eating at the bar, we observed the same seadragon roll that we ordered in a much larger size!  (fatter more fillings)  The roll was tasty but the real disappointment was the soft shell crab. It was burned and cold - probably had been prepared several hours earlier.  Have had much better in the burbs of San Diego.  Drinks are overpriced, but that's the norm at the casinos on the strip.

"Stopped in here to catch the tail end of happy hour last night.  Grabbed a \""BlackSmith\"" (Guiness and Smithwicks) in a 25oz mug along with the mini-rack of pork ribs over seasoned fries appetizer.   Appetizers were half off, domestic mugs $3.50 IIRC, and $1 off other drafts.   My tab came to about $12. \n\nThe food was decent, but not exceptional in my mind.   The ribs were tasty, although a tad on the dry side.  The amount of seasoning they put on the steak fries was perfect.  I really like the fact that they have 25oz drafts, because 1 beer is never quite enough to quench the thirst if I'm having food.  \n\nThe inside of the place is about what I've come to expect out of an \""Irish\"" bar, lots of dark wood, brass, and mirrors.  Crowd seemed pretty average joe.  Wait staff was attentive and nice.",215,2
"3.5 stars\n\nI am afraid my review is going to sound a bit repetitious of previous yelps, but I figured I should add my two cents. \n\nI love Oreganos. When I was attending college in Tucson, Oreganos was just opening up. In fact my roommate and I attended a group interview in an attempt to snag a job, but unfortunately they did not find our request to wear diner outfits and call ourselves Dot and Myrtle amusing. Perhaps we were just too excited to serve pizza. \n\nI enjoy the pizza (I am not above thin crust), pasta, and atmosphere- in fact it is my in laws favorite place to go when they are in town. The pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu. The chicken is thin, almost shaved, strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness. The one thing that keeps me from making the drive to Oreganos more often is the wait. No reservations, first come first served type of place and despite them having plenty of seating options, and on occasions open tables, I never seem to get out of there with less than a 30-45 minute wait. Regardless of the time of day, day of week, season, etc. there is always a wait. Once you get past the wait for the table, then you wait a little more for your server, then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours (depending on how many of us) and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza. \n\nWhile some people complain that it is a chain, it is a local start chain, which keeps it out of the axis of evil for me. I will continue to return to Oreganos on occasion, when I have absolutely no plans to follow my meal.",396,2

Sauces that were once delicate and light are now weighted down with starch and made unbearable with sugar. I went with about 6 other people and the only dishes we enjoyed were some pan fried noodles, and some stir fried greens. I don't even know what the greens were... maybe snow pea leaves... but they were good. Still 2 out of the 10 dishes we ordered isn't a good record.",134,1
"really disappointed with this place. I will not buy beer from here ever again. either in the bar, or in the can. given them way too many chances to change my mind, and each time I do give them a chance I'm even more disappointed than the last time. first time I tried hop drop, I thought it was really good. not great, just good. each time I've had hop drop after that, the quality of it just gets lower and lower. my husband bought two cans tonight, and both of them were infected, which makes us think that the whole shipment of cans that he grabbed the two from are infected. they both have the super strong smell of butterscotch, and have a really gross and slimy mouth feel. also, every time we've given them more chances and bought cans of hop drop, each time they've tasted different. one time it would be more malty, the next time there would be more of a hop flavor. that makes us think that they don't really care or pay attention to their canning line. especially since we got infected cans? I mean come on, get it together. birdsong is right next door. go there instead. I even think the beer is better there too.",256,0

"I'd give Bertha's a 4.5 if possible. I came here with the toddler and my friend P (I've got to name them, this is just getting confusing calling them all \""my friend\"" - I sound like a creepy priest) after a stop at Eileen where we worked up an appetite trying on clothes. We love splitting things so we figured out our order and she grabbed us a table (it was a Friday at noon so it was more like hunting season than lunch time when it came to finding a table) and I stood in line with the toddler. \n\nI ordered us both the half sandwich and salad combos. One was the salami, pesto and goat cheese sandwich with the goat cheese roasted pepper salad and the other combo was the roast beef and caramelized onion sandwich with the Thai chicken salad. The toddler was in crisis with his Daddy being in San Francisco all week for work and he had taken to random crying jags so I thought a mini red velvet cupcake would help him with his malady. \n\nBoth sandwiches were delicious, though I think the salami sandwich edged the roast beef out by a hair because it came on a ciabatta roll and had goat cheese on it. I love goat cheese so much. It could make crap taste delicious. The goat cheese and roasted pepper salad was good, but the Thai peanut chicken salad was PHENOMENAL! The peanut dressing was so nice and spicy. Usually menu descriptions will say the Thai dressing is spicy and it will have a little zip, but this dressing actually was. The chicken on the salad was thinly sliced and moist and tender and it came with lots of roasted peanuts. We were going to see if next time instead of a half sandwich a small salad, we could just do two small salads. There were so many on the menu that looked good. \n\nAs for the cupcake, we had one more missing-daddy breakdown but the sugar kicked in and seemed to do the trick. He's a generous little man and gave a lick of the frosting and it was tasty. Next time I'd like to try a treat for myself from the pastry case. Maybe a lemon bar or something like that. \n\nWhat a treat to find a place that makes everything from scratch and has so many choices. We'll definitely be back and I'm already making my next choices off the menu.",491,3

"The west Valley's architectural geography is comprised of little strip malls with an anchor store (usually a grocery store), a nail salon, and pay day loan center. Nail salons are a dime a dozen, and they all offer pretty much the same services. Even though Vien nails appears to fit the standard mold they are so much better. \n\nA typical French pedicure lasts about two weeks. And really only one before you have to pull out the ol' Sally Hansen touch up kit. However, I can go three weeks or longer with a pedicure from Vien. It takes them about an hour to complete the process because they massage your legs with lotion and do the hot stones. All of this is standard procedure as well. \n\nThe staff is so nice, and they even remember you after a while too. They are all very skilled at their jobs. I also love that they provide damn near every magazine known to mankind, and they have a flat screen for movies. \n\nThis is the place to get your nails did (excuse my Missy Elliott throwback).",218,3

I counted at least four stink eyes during my last visit for seemingly innocent offenses ranging from knocking a pair of jeans off their cheap clippy hangers to putting a pair of Dr. Martens back on the shelf two spots down from where I grabbed them.

I asked her when she dropped off my wrap if it was a chicken kabob and she replied \""whatever you ordered that's what it is\"" and my order was wrong.",110,2
"We were recently in Scottsdale to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday which happened to fall on Sunday, the 16th. We were with another couple who always said this was the best Sunday brunch in America, (better than the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs and others). We were excited about the birthday as well as the highly recommended brunch.\n\nUnfortunately, upon arrival, things went bad and never improved. We were seated at an outdoor table with a good view (one of the few positives), however, a circular pool of vomit was adjacent to one of our chairs. We had to ask for someone to come and clean it up. Instead of \""I'm terribly sorry, let me seat you at another table,\"" we just had to stand around the area and wait almost 10 minutes for the clean up to be completed.\n\nDuring the delay, I decided to explore the buffet and what was being offered to make it so expensive. I started at the first area (inside) and was greeted by the stifling smell of rotten fish. Perhaps, that was what made the last person so sick. Moving quickly past to the row of food items arranged outside (where the air was fresh), I asked to see the lamb chops and beef tenderloin, both of which were cooked beyond \""well done.\"" Even the prime rib was overcooked and dry. The cooked meats appeared just right for my in-laws from Oklahoma, but out of the question for anyone who typically orders medium-rare. French toast and other egg items appeared to have been pre-cooked, certainly not to order. The only edible item was the fresh tacos being made to order by an old Mexican woman.\n\nI returned to our table after the vomit was cleaned up, decided not to order the buffet and asked the waiter for a menu. My wife and the other couple opted for the buffet (against my recommendation). I waited at least 10 more minutes for the menu to come and the waiter disappeared again. Finally, I ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger and fries for which, again, I had to wait almost 25 minutes. I guess I was being punished for not ordering the overpriced, overcooked buffet!\n\nAfter we were through and left, I asked my wife how the tacos were (the ONLY thing she got from the buffet that she could eat). She said \""fine, but hardly worth the price.\"" I'm glad the other couple picked up the check as this was simply HORRIBLE food and a big disappointment!

First of all I want to start off by saying to the people that is talking bad about Red Persimmons Nails and Spa in Silverado Ranch Las Vegas NV. You guys really haven't even seen the whole crew that works there. They busted all there times and days to make you guys happy and also even enjoy your stay there while you getting your nails done. They are very nice people and they don't talk behind your back in there own language. Also all the staffs there speaks and understand English. Even though they might not be able to speak fluently doesn't mean they all don't understand. They even do there best to make the place nice and clean and as comfortable as possible for all of you guys while you guys are there to have your nails done. Yes they may at times lacked of workers at but they still all tried there best to fit everyone in there busy schedule as possible and also to ensured that you guys leave with a healthy and happy smile. The owner even works hard at home because she is old and not much help to the shop and don't want to be in the way. She tries to look for new staffs to hire to fit your needs.They even remodeled the restroom and the whole sink area in the front and replaced new Spa chairs brand new and even add like a few more to fit everyone in. They even also have replaced all the nail tables and all the polished and tools to used brand new on there clients.They are also very fast and stabilized with all there tools and towels are always washe'd and cleaned . All there tools and towels always kept cleaned and warmed up in the heating oven for the safety and stabilized convenience.They really work very hard to make everyone walked out happy. That also even goes out of there ways on main US Holidays and our Asian main Holidays to open for everyone convenience cause other shops are closed on thosed days. How do I know this because I am the daughter of the owner and all my families are the ones that is working there. Even though I don't live in Las Vegas but I do come visit from time to time there from California and I see how all my families had to work so hard to make all of you guys happy and you guys just talking bad about them like that. I just feel so bad and also very sad for all my families to be treated like  that. I am very hurt and almost cried for my families when I saw all these bad post reviews of Red Persimmons. Please reconsider your thoughts before ever posting up a review thank you very much.,518,4
"Pho Thanh is a great Vietnamese joint that provides delicious Pho to everyone and anyone that enjoys partaking in savory broth goodness. I actually just observed the many bowls and happy guests consuming the large bowls of noodles and broth, and instead partook in the vermecelli dish with pickled vegetables, grilled smokey pork, salad, peanuts and fish sauce to toss all together. It is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes, and Pho Thanh does it well.\n\nI got it with a refreshing coconut that was perfectly ripe and a great accompaniment to my lunch. \n\nPrices are super reasonable/low compared to the Pho restaurant I have access to in Tucson, AZ.

"I waited over 2 months to write my review so that I knew I wasn't writing it just out of a knee jerk reaction and anger. I will spare all of the details but what a renter needs to know is that this company is solely there to look out for the interest of the property owner, NOT he renter.  They are not concerned with morals or ethics and will put their own aside, assuming they have any personally, and always do as the owners wish. Renters rights in NV are very limited, so if you are willing to take up a fight with them it will really ultimately be through the court.  We rented for over 4 years dealt with Gretchen exclusively and she was typically very nice and kind, and was usually prompt in her responses, but when it came down to the end and the property owner making flat out false claims and lies the owner of her company, Shanon Day, sided with the property owner Royce Chow. He owns over 30 properties and I was told he basically pays the Shannon Day Realty bills. Ultimately I was so incredibly saddened by their lack of character and morals. My husband and I decided to walk away from $500 instead of deal with the pettiness of them any longer. I can see how a property owner in another review couldn't understand these bad reviews and would think they were fantastic; if money is all that matters in this life. However, as a business person this speaks volumes to who they are as a company and people throughout the company. Shannon, the owner, is willing to contract with blatantly dishonest owners, Royce Chow, and Gretchen is FULLY AWARE OF EVERY SINGLE ISSUE, DISCREPANCY AND FALSE CLAIM, and agreed with me to my face that the actions of the owner were wrong, yet she still chooses work for this company and passes along Shannon's decisions. They obviously are all dishonest and morally corrupt. Think twice because if the owner of the property is bad this company will go right along with it and won't think twice. Doing the right thing doesn't mean anything to them, and unfortunately it doesn't to a lot of people anymore.",437,0

I have heard people rave about Italian restaurants that I, as an Italian, find lacking; so I suspect that someone of Chinese ancestry might think First Wok falls short.  Take that as a caveat.  Anyway, I like their egg rolls and boiled dumplings.  The crab rangoons don't impress.  Their hot and sour soup is good.  Gentle kick to it.  I often get Pork Lo Mein and enjoy that.  Servings are ample.  The General Tsao Chicken is good, as are all the entrees I have tried.  The usual unappetizing photos of their dishes adorn the wall.  I often wonder about those photos.  A friend living in Taiwan sent me a cookbook that was popular there and it contained the same quality photos of the food.  Curious.  The menu lists a plethora of items and the wall has posted another list of dozens of entrees.  What these all are escapes me and there is often a language barrier when asking for an explanation.  Sometimes I feel adventurous and plan to order something I never had before but I always end up going with something familiar.  For a sit-down dinner, I prefer Rainbow Gardens on Neil Street, but for a quick and satisfying Chinese dinner, First Wok should not disappoint.",289,3
"Blakeney shopping center: an effigy to the Ballantyne Woman, the Charlotte Woman, the young girl or even the austere Antebellum. If you find yourself male or something close to it, you need not venture out if not by the tail of your coat, dragged there like a dog--a rescue--by that I don't mean a valiant heroic dog--no, I am talking the really sad ones, the ones that really annoying girl posts on Facebook all the time whether you like it or not--even though she never actually adopts them or plans to. That is what we are, unimportant little pets, cute little luggage for our women to tote around and poke when it tickles their fancy. \n\nThere is a men's store I've only ever been to under the influence of a woman--my master--and do not wish to return to. There is Target, where even a man can stand under the air conditioning vents, smell the sweet, balmy scent of Target-brand-original-pheromones seeping through the louver and find himself inextricably tempted to buy something--anything.

Not a bar with a winsome young man bartending, dressed in black that goes by milf-lover91@yahoo.com as his match.com login. Even the one sports store in there is for cycling and running--why?

The fries were like limp strings of potato with absolutely no crispiness to it. The animal style sauce was - salad dressing? And the strawberry shake was decent, but it would get warm so quickly even in the restaurant that I would have to go through some gross warm shake before I got to the good stuff.

This was another 20 minutes!\n\nConclusion - the business traveler who rents   I like the airports that you get off the plane follow the signs and get in your car and go!",251,1
Messed up my order last time - they said they were aware of it before leaving the store to deliver & delivered it anyway.  Wtf?  Lol.  & they kept my tip.  Mostly on time though.,46,2
"Tried the Corn Beef Hash during breakfast morning hour.  Was good...but even though the plate looks big...a little deceiving since most of it was the potatoes.  Overall, a very different Pig/Cow themed restaurant upstairs from the lobby of the The Quad hotel.  A bit pricey maybe for some folks.  With tip and coffee, price comes out to be about $20.  But you're on the strip so that price is probably normal.  I don't know why the wait time was so long since there were many empty tables on the back.  But once at the table, the service was pretty quick.",131,2
"Very friendly, but doesn't have as much character as the Pig.  I tried two of the in-house beers, the Cherry Milk Stout (delicious) and the Red Rye Ale (disgusting).",43,2
"How clueless am I to have not known there was a Kilwin's in Charlotte?  I'm almost never on this side of town but was off so I decided to try Blue Taj and noticed this sweet shop on my drive in.  It has pretty much the same goodies as the one in Charleston....ice cream, homemade waffle cones, chocolate and more chocolate!",76,3
Good naan and Punjabi veggies. The restaurant was nice and staff was friendly.,17,3
"First, I will say that some of the food here is very good.\n\nHowever, when I ate here on a Saturday night with 3 companions, it was pretty disappointing. First, they were out of lasagna. This is an Italian restaurant at 6:45 on a Saturday night. So I ordered a pasta and seafood dish another diner was enjoying and it was excellent-- lots of mussels, clams, and shrimp in a marinara sauce tossed with pasta.\n\nTwo of my friends ordered one of the many pizza combinations but were served the quatro fromaggio instead, not what they ordered. It was pretty salty, too. There was no apology, just a lecture by the chef to the undertrained teenage waiter.\n\nI think that Saturday night should have an experienced server. Just my thought, as one who has waited tables in the past.\n\nThe grilled chicken salad was very good. The calamari appetizer was OK. The sauce tasted like it was from a can. My preteen liked the chicken sub and fries.\n\nMainly, it was the very poorly-trained service that was the problem. There should have been an apology for serving the wrong pizza.. That would have gone a long way.",255,1
"This is the what I proper Irish pub should model itself after. It's a very laidback place with a friendly staff and solid Irish pub food.  The picky eater I was with loved her steak sandwich. They menu is well rounded with several hearty choices.\n\nThe atmosphere was really chill with everyone seem to be in their own world enjoying themselves. Seating was at a premium since this place seemed to be packed early.  The had a band but the best part was when they brought out the traditional Irish Dancers. I think that's a nice touch that adds to the experience and goes above and beyond your regular day pub down the street. \n\nThis is a good place if you want to chill if you are not into the nightclubs that are all around the area, but still want to have a good time.",171,3

The sales team graciously showed me ways to wear my lovely scarf and also directed me to download the Herm\u00e8s Silk Knots app for additional tutorials. How fabulous! Life is all about the little luxuries, and they can be had here!",136,4
"I stayed here recently during CES and AVN. Overall, I was impressed. Check-in was efficient and the woman was polite. We received a tower room with a strip view. In addition, we asked for a non-smoking king and there was no smoke smell in the room. \n\nThe room was clean and didn't seem old or rundown. The bathroom had one sink and a separate tub and glass-enclosed shower. Some of the things about the room were strange but it wasn't a big deal taking into account the very low price we paid. For example, we only got a single trashcan situated next to the toilet. They use some really cheap brand of toilet paper that is thin and abrasive. We also had an adjoining room with strangers next door and the noise was much louder through the door than I thought it would be. The television was a CRT but we didn't really use it anyway. There was no room safe but the front desk did offer complimentary safe deposit boxes that were located somewhere in the lobby. There was complimentary internet via hard wire that came from the rear of the television. It wasn't really convenient to stretch the long wire across the room but we didn't really use it anyway.   There's lots of advertising at Luxor (flyers in rooms, phone messages, aggressive timeshare people, etc) but it is easy to ignore. I just gave a stern \""No, thank you.\"" to the timeshare people and they quickly moved on to the next victim.\n\nWe used the gym, which was included in the resort fee. The room was long and rectangular with weights on one end, a stretching/ball area on the other and cardio machines in between. They have a little fridge in the gym with complimentary water but didn't offer any spray or washing solution to wipe off the machines after using. The people working at the spa didn't check to see that we were actually staying at the hotel, which I found strange. I chose a machine in between a porn star and a couple of European dudes lifting weights while trying to gain her attention. Best workout ever. \n\nThe rooms also come with 2 small bottles of water per day. It was a great way to rehydrate after a long night of drinking. Oh and the clientele was very interesting here. It seemed it was a lot of college kids and recent college grads and porn industry folks who were in town for AVN. I like the location a lot but I prefer to hang out in the hotels nearby, not in Luxor itself. Overall, I might consider staying here again but the whole pyramid tomb thing makes me paranoid. The price paid for the room was very good for the quality of the room we received.\n\nIn the casino, we hit up the craps lesson, which happens everyday at 1pm. I felt that the lesson was very good and, later on, with the help of the dealers, I picked up rather quickly.",611,2
"Just searched on yelp and went there with friends. The food was really nice. Liked the chicken makhani that I ordered, my friend ordered paneer masala and it was yummy ! They charge you $0.99 per bowl of rice, but definitely worth it , it had a great taste !! Overall very satisfied with the food, the service could have been better due to which I am going for 4/5",86,3
"I'm not a huge fan of fast food, but the macho nachos here are trouble! Recently had a bad day and stopped in, devoured them on my own- no shame, eating the pain away.\nThey're good though- portion is HUGE and the dish is heavy. Initially they look to be swimming in sour cream, but the pickled jalapenos balance that out pretty good. Amount of beans and cheese is fairly low, so these aren't really a \""heavy\"" dish that will feel like a brick in your belly afterward. \n\nThis place also has pretty good fish tacos, served classic-style with corn tortillas with a nice sauce. Tasty, would order again- pair of tacos comes in a $3 order, upgrade to shrimp and the pair goes up to $5.\n\nService, even in the dead of night, is friendly. Have yet to dine in. As others have said, given they have the same price point, this chain is head and shoulders above Taco Bell's menu offerings and quality.",215,2
"The food as usual was delicious. My favorite dish is the fried bass with drunken noodles. The fish is boneless, sliced in to strips and fried to perfection. Perfect with the side of drunken noodles. The tom yum soup was not very good tonight. It normally is spot on. This place is always so packed, the service lacks. You should definitely make reservations if you go. \n\nOne issue I have with this place is the neighborhood it's in. There are lots of panhandlers here and it never fails that I get hit up for money. I just don't feel safe leaving here after dinner alone. Definitely go with company! Aside from that, you can expect good thai food. :)",145,4
"We came in for $1.5 (Some were $2) tacos and $5 margaritas.  The tacos were good, nothing exceptional but for $2 or less they were good.  We were in and out pretty quickly, nothing really inviting about the place - but it was nice for a quick, cheap meal.",67,2
"The staff was very nice and friendly.  We stayed in a Grand King and my parents were in the One Bedroom Suite.  Very nice and comfortable renovated rooms and the staff was very nice.  I just don't like having to pay, in addition to the room rate, a $25 per day Resort Fee.  I was told the Resort Fee is mandatory and it covers the use of the business center, ability to print boarding passes, the cardio room, pool, and the USA Today newspaper delivered to your room every day.  I was also shocked to learn the rooms, including the Suites, do not include a coffee maker.  I was told by Concierge that I can order a pot of coffee every morning for $23.  I opted to just purchase a $15 coffee maker from the local Target.  I also didn't appreciate not getting complete information from the front desk at check-in.  It wasn't until the day before checking-out, I was informed by someone at Valet, that as a guest, I can call from my room and request to have my car brought out in order to reduce the average 30 minute wait time.",244,2
"I always forget about Duck & Decanter, and then as soon as I visit again, I'm reminded about how pleasant it is to eat here.\n\nAt first glance, the menu can seem a little overwhelming - so many choices!  And they all sound so delicious!  But as someone who can be a little picky at times, I really appreciate the ability to easily customize my sandwich, or better yet, just build my own!  There is also an extensive choice of sides, sweets and beverages to chose from!  And while you're waiting for them to make your sandwich, check out the cool (unique!) stuff they carry!  A great place to pick up souveniers for visitors or a gift for a friend.  The patio (in nice weather) is very nice with wonderful mature trees, and the music that is available from time to time adds to the ambience.",184,3

"I guess the thing that messes things up for ElllaEm's is that I grew up on soul food in L.A. and it's simply better than any I've had in LV....M & Ms, Roscoe's Chicken N Waffles, Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch, Harold & Belles...you hear me knockin'?\n\nWent with the chicken  and waffles and they were ok.  The chicken needs more seasoning and there needs to be a few more pieces on the plate. The waffle needs to be pumped up some because they are a bit on the thin side and not too flavorful. I would recommend there be a host/ hostess  posted  at the entrance because when you walk in you don't know what to do. Do I wait  for a server or do I just pick my own seat?  Service needs to be faster as well, we waited far too long  for the amount of food we ordered. \n\nNow, me and my out of town guests  were dead set on trying the peach cobbler but they said they ran out. I love cobbler so I tried again on Sunday and they ran out again. Still have not tried the cobbler.\n\nI think EllaEm's excels at their sides. The yams are some of the best anywhere. The collard greens are excellent and the fried cabbage is pure perfection. However,  the mac n cheese was just ok. \n\nPrices are reasonable  and parking is really good. There are several other good eateries within this shopping center as well. For first timers I recommend ordering the pork chops, collard greens, yams and the cobbler......if you can find it.",355,2
"ahhh.. Palazzo, which means \""palace\"".. holds up to its name. This place frickin impressed me. We had 6 girls in this place and it wasn't uncomfortable at all! This suite truly made our all girl's getaway complete.  We came with 13 girls so we had two suites next to eachother. With this many girls, a huge bathroom is a must... and lemme tell you, that bathroom is more than adequate! \n\nahh there is just so much to love about the Palazzo.. the decor is simple and chic yet .. just really tasteful! Oh, and the 2 TVs outside and a mini one inside the bathroom.. ballllllaaaa\n\nGrand Lux Cafe is also a huge plus! those damn crabcakes are delicious and prices are so reasonable. best part is that the cafe is open 24 hours. We got some to-go and took it back to hotel and when we came back it was gone! Palazzo was really professional about it and gave us a $50 Voucher for future use at any of their restaurants. How awesome?! Being connected to the Venetian is now a plus for me too because I love Venetian's Bouchon Bakery..\n\nanyways. worth every penny to stay at this palace. =D",266,4
"This place was a complete disappointment.  Though the staff was friendly, and fast.  The food was just not worth it.  The Buffalo Caprese was delish.

"Not impressed one bit.  With so much competition nearby you need to separate yourself and this place did not.  The food is your typical bar food. Nothing that stands out.

"It had been awhile since I'd been to a Lone Star and I really had no memories of the experience, so a few friends and I decided to try it out as it was the nearest steakhouse to our location.\n\nWe were extremely disappointed. Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.\n\nI ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.\n\nThe salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.\n\nWhen my entr\u00e9e showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been saut\u00e9ed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).\n\nAlthough the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location. Sorry, Lone Star.",538,0
"China Pantry is located in the food court of the Las Vegas Premium outlets. Right in the middle of a busy shopping spree with my cousins, I found myself ordering a three item combo to share from here. For a little under $8, I got a combo with fried rice, noodles, chicken teriyaki, chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms. \n\nPros: \nIt was a decent amount of food! They don't really give a lot but it is enough to get you decently full. \n\nThe chicken teriyaki was nice and lean! There was a good amount of chicken in the chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms (meaning it wasn't all veggies).\n\nTaste wise the food was pretty good. The chicken dishes were flavorful! The curry sauce was good. The teriyaki was just the right amount of sweet! \n\nCons: \nI didn't order anything to drink but did ask for water. The lady working there gave me a cup of water and when I asked for another (since I was sharing this meal), she said only one water per customer :(.\n\nIt's an OK place. A little bit pricey which is to be expected since it is at a food court at a popular outlet.",261,2

"Well, I won't be going here again in the foreseeable future.\n\nWe went for breakfast and the food was alright at best. My bacon was not cooked as ordered so the waiter awkwardly made me remove the bacon from my plate of food to put on a separate plate he had to take away - all the while without saying a word. Also the portions of eggs and potatoes were small. The blueberry muffin was the best part of the whole experience. \n\nThe waiter was the worst part of the experience. We had Todd. I'm pretty sure you can't even call this guy a waiter. (For the record I waitressed in college so I understand how it's supposed to be done & the hardships that come along with the job). He hardly spoke to us and was beyond weird. He made my boyfriend and I feel uncomfortable and awkward during all points of interaction. Sure, he was pretty functional and brought things we asked for, but he had a better than thou sort of persona. Never asked if anything was ok, never said you're welcome to a thank you (he wouldn't say anything but just walk away), and the bored to death look never left his face. It pretty much felt he hated having to wait on us, hated his job, and hated life.\n\nThe entire visit was weird and like I said, we will not be going back. I gave this place 2 stars for the fact the food was decent and the restaurant seemed clean. I would recommend to steer clear of this place unless you like mediocre food and terrible service.",326,1

"Located on Tollcross, Two Thin Laddies is a bit of a disappointment. Maybe my experience of it was like when you go see a film that's been ranted and raved about so much that you're expecting cordon bleu and you get a glorified greasy spoon, or in cinema terms, you're expecting Scorsese and you get Love, Actually. That's not to mean it's not satisfying, but I came out with a very disappointing taste in my mouth.\n\nI went out of my way to go there for breakfast because I had to wait a couple of hours before being attended at the GUM clinic. My main disappointment was that if you go somewhere for breakfast and order a poached egg, you kind of expect it to actually be poached and not just cracked and boiled and overdone in water. But my egg was definitely the latter. On a redeeming note, the person I went there with said the sausages were actually quite good, and I'm guessing, not overdone. \n\nThis isn't to say that Two Thin Laddies is terrible. It does decent food, but when somewhere's been talked up so much, it'll almost inevitably be a disappoint. I may as well have paid less and gone to Snax that morning.",264,2

"It didn't bother me a lot at first, but the more I think about it, the more unsatisfied I am with our experience here.  We went with a group of about 10 or so people.  It was pretty empty in there, so it wasn't very loud, which was nice.  It was so dark, we had to use our cell phones to see the menu.  No biggie.  There was a large menu with a good variety of eats.  We went with the nachos which were pretty good, although, I don't think pulled pork really goes with nachos.  Anyway, the website advertised $1 draft beer and $1 SoCo Limes.  When we got there around 7:15, we learned that the \""$1 beers\"" didn't start until 8, so the ones that couldn't wait ordered the $7 Mason jar beers.  At 8, we ordered the $1 beers (Bud Light, Miller Light and Coors Lite only) and got one or maybe 2 rounds for some of those.  The server then told us that there was no longer $1 drafts, but $3 Mason jars.  She also said that there were not $1 SoCo Limes.  After a little convincing, she did give us one round of $1 Soco Limes served in big plastic cups.  After asking, they did start the mechanical bull for a few guys in our group.  He was cool and even let them each go twice.  At the end, she did not know what anyone had ordered, so we had to try to remember everything we ate and drank.  Seemed kind of disorganized.",350,0

(Lost!)  Americana style food, but with a fusion (Southwest?/Italian?).  The Meatball skewers were very good I must say.  If you can't handle the heat, stay off the Jalapeno poppers -- wow!  I should have ordered some milk at the bar! (If I wasn't so lost!)  Service was very good too, but with more servers in the place than patrons; it better be good :)  (I'm still lost!)  Hot staff members can only go so far to make the place more interesting, but it's starting to be such a clich\u00e9.  Ambience was pretty chill, but we need more customers to make this place go pop!

"A waste of space that could have been well used. The venue is smaller and simpler, but not worth your time. \n\nI've never had to pay to enter a club in LV, but the bank made me pay $20 and said I get a 'mixed drink' at the bar. Of course I find out it's just a well drink. The bartender over poured the vodka and strange enough I couldn't even taste it in my vodka tonic. I hate rip off places that water down their drinks. \n\nThe music was ghetto. I didn't even know who the DJ was. \n\nOn top of it all, the woman in the front was extremely rude. One would imagine the cashier could give you a smile while asking for $20 from you. \n\nDefinitely one of the many, \""we're doing YOU, the customer, a favor\"" places in LV. We are the reason you are in business... And there is no appreciation. Save your time and money and go to XS or Hakkasan. At least they serve real alcohol there.",232,0
"I came here at 720am trying to get my car aligned. Greeted by Bob, he told me that it'll be about an hour to get my car on the rack. I told him that I'll be back in an hour then after checking in. When I came back at 830, there's more technicians working as well as a few more customers. I walked in and another tech greeted me by name so I I'm assuming my car should be next in line. After waiting for another hour, while other cars after me being serviced, they tried to get my car on the rack but couldn't. I don't know what are those 2x4 laying around the shop for and u couldn't use a couple to get my car on the rack. A 10-15 mins alignment turned into 2-3 hours wasted of my morning.",188,1
"So we headed to Cibo after a night downtown going to a special event, followed by a movie- then dinner! The good: it was Sat. night and the wait wasn't too long. The pizza and pear salad we ordered was awesome. \nThe downside, my fiance ordered the \""calzone pizza\"" you can see that this is listed for yourself under the pizza section here: http://www.cibophoenix.com/cena.pdf. Across from it you see the \""Crostone\"" which is described as being a calzone. You can see where this is going. They served up a calzone. We asked a gentleman working there about it- he was clueless as to what might even be on the menu- and then made us feel crazy. Then the waitress came over and we asked her and she said that both of those menu items are calzones. Which is strange since one is described as a calzone- they other as an actual pizza. \nShe said this happens \""all the time.\"" \nThat's fine but either change your menu, or let someone know when they are ordering it that they are NOT ordering a pizza. I will also say that the pecorino cheese on the pear salad is cut so thick that in the candle light it looked like jicama. The service continues to be bad, we waited time and time again for water, they never asked if we wanted to order more wine, and the check came quickly, but it was with our credit-card on the table for about 20 mins. SERIOUSLY! Also, they seem to have some kind of ant problem in the courtyard- we were bit up before we even ordered. \nALL of this being said and the food was great! Not so great that I couldn't make it at home if I had all the ingredients- but still VERY GOOD.",384,2

"Let me start off by saying the student dentists are great and so very friendly and that I'm a student at Midwestern myself so I understand the whole learning process. However, I have never had such a horrible experience with one single tooth. The whole plan was for me to re-do a root canal on one of my bottom molars and then insert a crown. \n\nHowever, that required a total of 8 visits (each lasting 2-3 hours) for just one tooth. This was due to multiple lab errors for the actual crown itself (I had to get an impression three times!!), bad receptionist communication, and lack of proper execution. That's 16-24 hours of my life that I'll never get back because MWU doesn't know how to contract with a decent lab and how to properly book and handle patients. I'm very disappointed and very, very frustrated. My advice: go in for simple procedures like preventative care and extractions but anything else and you might end up with a huge headache and a ton of wasted time.",223,1
"The nice guys and gal, have been taking care of my car for years now.  Anything my car needs, I trust that they'll do their best.  Except for tires that is, that's where I'm gonna say Costco has the best deals and they too do a pretty fine job, but that's besides the point.\n\nJust recently my car had been making loud clunky noises at every turn and well, I was getting pretty concerned.  I called in, made an appointment and they said they'd do the inspection for free, as long as it wasn't too invasive.  So I'm pretty excited, cause finally I'll know what's going on with my car.  I drop off my car and in an hour or so, get the dreaded phone call: the diagnosis.  Both bushings need to be replaced.  And it's going to be $800.  So here I am, on the verge of tears, wondering if I'm being scammed, why it's so expensive and god, why didn't I just opt for the lightrail instead of a car?  I tell him to hold off on the bushings for now, for which he isn't too pleased, considering they just did a full check on my car for free, but hell, I don't have $800 sitting around.\n\nI made five million calls (not really, but it sure felt like it) to dealerships and other shops, seeing if any of them would be willing to give me a quote for replacing the bushings and I get quotes upwards of $800, even one place quoting me $1,200.  $800 isn't looking so bad anymore but boy, that hurts.  I pick up my car and talk to the guy, now that he's convinced that I'm going to get the bushings replaced, but not this instant, he was more willing to negotiate.  He tells me he can throw in a 10% discount, that there are a couple alignment coupons online, even if it is only for $15.  I say I'll be back and am on my merry way, except for the thought of being about $700 poorer next paycheck.\n\nSo that was a while ago, and I just got the bushings replaced yesterday.  I dropped it off before heading to work, and picked it up after, and viola!  No more clunky noises!  Knowing my financial situation, they kept their word, giving me the 10% discount, honored my $15 coupon, and volunteered to hold off on a system flush since it wasn't pressing.  I walked out paying just under $600, feeling like a champ, with my car feeling like new, just nursing my newly emptied wallet.",594,4

"Decent bar atmosphere with dark wood and tavern like feel to it.  Being that it is a bar, I was actually surprised by the amount of families. But, a neighborhood bar to say the least. Came on St. Patty's weekend around lunchtime which meant this place was packed wall to wall. We eventually found a high top and were able to watch both the Pitt and Pens games. They have several TVs in all different angles which is really nice when it's packed and you don't really have to worry about finding a place near one single tv or anything. \n\nIt was kind of a mess, but because it was a packed holiday weekend, I'll cut them a break. The food wasn't that good at all.. I had the Reuben sandwich and my friend had a chicken salad. Yes, it's a bar, but I've had good food at several bars before. The service was also overwhelmed and really slow. You would've been better off walking up to the bar and ordering a drink on your own. Needless to say, it wasn't a horrible experience by any means, but I wasn't impressed.",239,1

"this will be a different type of review because it started off a little weird but ended up being better.\n\nWe went on Wednsday night for dinner, a group of 6 of us.  We showed up for our reservation and were seated right away.  The menu's came out along with water and the waiter came by asking us for drinks.  i ordered a Rum and Coke and his dickhead response was \""I'd imagine Bacardi is ok....\"", i told him to surprise me even though i was a bit irritated.  He asked if we were getting appetizers to split and we said yes and picked up the \""Antipasto Della CASA\"" which had amazing cheeses and meats, the \""Fritto Misto\"" which was the best Calamari i ever tasted, and he suggested the famous Meatballs (which again, the best i ever had).  After the appetizer order, he took our menus which seemed a bit off but we didn't think much of it since we were having a good time.  After we ate the appetizers he came back over and asked if everything was good and if we needed anything else.  He was SHOCKED when we said we had been waiting to order more drinks and dinner.  His attitude completely changed and then he was all over our table being the nicest guy ever.  \n\nThe food was really good, i got the \""Chicken Scarpariello\"" which was amazing, but seemed a little small and mostly peppers in the bowl, i wish it had a bit more sausage.  The veal chop was amazing too, i'm glad i was able to try my friends. \n\nOverall it turned into a good night was lots of food and drinks, i just wish the our waiter wouldn't have irked me the wrong way right off the bat!",376,2
"Yet another Groupon alert. I just can't say no when I see a place in my area offer a Groupon. \n\nThe place was just ok. I ordered the spicy chicken bowl and although I like the heat, I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. It had a sweet flavor that I disliked and I wasn't a big fan of the rice. The shrimp tempura we shared was ok and the orange chicken and chicken teriyaki I tried from both my fella and my mom's plate were pretty tasty. I liked the texture of the orange chicken, despite not typically liking the orange sauce most places use.\n\nAll in all, it's a good little fast food teriyaki place. I'd recommend it for a quick on the go meal, but it's just ok overall. I'd probably go back, but only if I had another coupon.",188,2
"This complex used to be called Haven Luxury, but has been taken over by a new management group. When the new management group took over, these apartments went to hell. I have had nothing but issues with these people. They have lost 5 of my packages in the office.

There priorities are not in the right place. I renewed my leading agreement 11 months ago. Before I renewed, we were promised a renovated gym and laundry facilities. They said they would be ready within 4 months. Guess what, 11 months later and they just opened up the gym. The staff, for the most part is OK. It's a 50/50 chance that you will get someone who is nice and not a stuck up snob. All in all, I would say look elsewhere for a place to live.

"WOW. This place is so great. Forget Krispy Kreme-- I'm coming here for my donuts from now on. It's a small mom and pop shop, and they have such a wide selection of flavors. Their croissants are super huge and look to be very flakey like the real deal, but I'll update that the next time I come in. I bought 4 dozen assorted flavors and let the sweet Asian lady choose for me. The total came down to $37.00 even with tax, she discounted a few cents and even gave me a free bag of glazed donut holes (SOO GOOD SERIOUSLY). They taste so light and fluffy and melt in your mouth. EXACTLY like Krispy Kreme, if not better. And plus? HELLO PRICE TAG. So cheap! About $8.56 for a dozen of quality goods. I see on their menu if you buy 5 dozen or more you can call and get a discount. But at their original price it already is a discount! Very good quality, a lot of my coworkers will be going here from now on too! You rock Good Donuts!\n\nP.S. SO willing to try the fruit smoothies (esp. Taro boba) next time!! LOVE LOVE",258,4
"This is one of the most popular clubs in Vegas. One of the benefits of this club is, there is a ladies line.

"First time to this place.  Have driven past it hundreds of times and always wondered if it was any good.  Well my kids were jonesing for a smoothie and we were right down the street so I figured we would give a local business a shot at our ridiculous smoothie obsession.  Upon walking in it was obvious that they were going for the \""Central Perk\"" vibe...it was homey but cool.  That's about all I can say in a positive sense.  The place was way under staffed and those who were working seemed overwhelmed and disorganized.  We place our orders for three regular sized (medium) smoothies which were advertised to be made with nothing but fresh fruit.  We were all anticipating a great drink.  After waiting about 15 minutes for our drinks (which seemed to be the norm for all customers) we were extremely underwhelmed by what we received.  They were definitely not using fresh fruit; it must have been some kind of concentrate as there was no hint of any real fruit in the drink.  Second they added a ton of ice to the drink and didn't even blend it well enough to consume through a straw.  All three of our drinks were lousy...I didn't finish mine.  The people working there seemed very nice but did not deliver a good product in a reasonable amount of time.  Three medium smoothies were $20.  I may have hit these guys on an off day but will be sticking to Jamba Juice in the future.",308,1
"I've only heard positive things about the Chef of Jennifer's. She is a well trained chef and has worked in many very prestigious restaurants. \n\nI came here for restaurant week and whoever prepared the food clearly wasn't Jennifer.\n\nThe best dish of the six we tried was the soup and sammich appetizer. The soup had little taste and seemed like half and half with pureed squash that was decorated nicely. The sandwich was tasty Grilled Brioche Bread that was stuffed with quality cheese, local honey and fresh pears. My husband had Arborio Rice that was still hard and not very creamy or tasty it was very flat and dry.\n\nMy second Course was Patagonia Salmon over a  Sunchoke Puree  that was getting broken up by a big puddle of oil. The Fish was topped with not so tasty combination of raw tomatoes, and brown chunks of garlic and some fresh basil. The Fish was edible.   My husband's Fresh Pasta Dish seemed like boxed spaghetti  instead of fresh pasta that was prepared mushy and seemed sort of watery.\n\nAt this point we were checked on and my husband informed the waiter about Hard Arborio Rice and Mushy Pasta. The waiter seemed sorry about that and walked away.\n\nI was hoping that desserts would be redeeming but for me they were the worst part of the meal.\n\nMy favorite dessert is Lemon Meringue Pie so I was hoping the Mason Jar Lemon Meringue would be delicious. The Meringue wasn't Meringue but tasted like that gooey jarred Marshmallow Stuff called \""Fluff\"" It was terrible to me. Nobody goes out for dinner and expects to receive  jarred \""Fluff\"".My husband was hoping for an apple Tarte Tatin. You can tell by the photo he didn't receive a Tarte Tatin. I didn't taste his dessert because I was too grossed out by the Marshmallow Fluff I just had but he said the dough was really weird. \n\nMaybe this is a really good sandwich place and not a dinner place? Maybe i hit this place on an off night and it's a possibility you might get a better prepared meal. I don't know.\n\nThis was more disappointing to me than the not so fresh sushi I had last week somewhere.\n\nJennifer needs to taste the food her cook prepares before it's too late.\n\nI will not return.",511,0

My experience was very similar to the other two. I also bought the living social deal. It took the staff 10 minutes to figure out i was a new patient. And 2 of the 4 people working there said the deal included more but then said they werent really sure. The person that did my consultation was not too bright and really had no clue what she was talking about. All she did was read a script. Anytime I asked a question she had to ask 3 others and they would come up with an answer. The Dr. is a joke. Very nice man however I do not really think he is a dr. He cared more about the other weight loss clinic i had previously went to then helping me. When it came time for me to get the supplements the girl at the front desk was too busy gossiping to help and again could not answer any questions. There were several others there that were unhappy and or confused as well. Not a good place and in a horrible location.  I will never go back to this place again.,215,0
"Pretty large portion size for a reasonable price. May want to share with someone. The food is your typical brunch foods like chicken and waffles, pancakes, sanwiches, biscuit gravy type of deal. The wait can be long. Also there is no phone reception so if you are waiting and are trying to reach the rest of your party that is gambling good luck with that because they won't seat you until your whole party is present.

"Great views with sky high prices to match, but I felt the food and atmosphere did make the final bill worth it. \n\nWe had a Sunday night meal here which meant fewer people and a more coordinated effort from the kitchen. Our server was Kevin and he was excellent and hilarious. We started with chorizo stuffed dates and crispy cauliflower. The dates were not only stuffed but also bacon wrapped bites of pure heaven. This dish is highly recommended. The cauliflower was meh and not worth mentioning. \n\nFor main courses we had the salmon, pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped scallops special, lamb loin and wild mushroom pizza. Portions are HUGE. Seriously, where were some of the other reviewers on here eating? The pizza was nearly an 18\"" pie; salmon was a generous size on a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes. Pork tenderloin had a sweet flavor w sweet potato mash and a bourbon sauce. We estimated the lamb loin to be at least 10 ozs and it came with fries as well. The scallops were the only normal sized dish and came w three to a plate on a bed of risotto. Everything was tasty, well cooked and well presented - even the pie which had a chewy crust and truffle oil. We ended our meal with the chocolate pot de creme. This was a large souffl\u00e9 dish of cold, rich chocolate creme topped w a caramel popcorn ball which oddly worked really well w the chocolate. \n\nYou might wonder why not five stars after all this raving? The reality is the food and service is solid, but not memorable. There wasn't a dish that made me feel like I had to come back again (except the dates!) especially with those price tags. This is the kind of place I would recommend visiting once to experience especially for the views, but there are other places in Charlotte that merit repeat visits.",384,3

"I stopped by here over the summer with my father for lunch.  We arrived shortly after 11:30 to an open door for the restaurant and walked inside.  There was no one there and initially we were confused where we should go.  Since we didn't see anyone coming to greet us we decided to go left only to see an empty room.  Since that was a dead end then we decided to go the other way and saw a gentleman sitting in a chair.  He sort of looked like he worked there and so we waited for him to talk to us which he did not.  Thankfully at this point a waitress came out from somewhere in the back and told us to sit where we wanted.\n\nFor lunch my father and I decided to start out our meal by ordering the Tennessee nachos which were essentially pulled pork nachos.  Then for my entree I ended up ordering the pulled chicken sandwich while my dad went with the french dip sandwich.  Whenever the nachos came out I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with the sheer size of them.  They could have easily been a meal and a half for a person eating alone.  They ended up tasting decently and my father and I finished half of them before our entrees made it out and we ended up taking the other half home.  My sandwich ended up tasting ok as well although I was missing any smokiness from the chicken (and the pork on our nachos for that matter).  So from that standpoint I didn't feel like I was eating a chicken sandwich from a BBQ joint.  At least their BBQ sauces tasted pretty decent.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here again in the future.  While the food itself was just ok, I really the appreciated the quantity that you received for your money.",374,2

"I'm embarrassed to admit it as a native Montrealer... But today was my first time at the famous Schwartz's. But, we waited outside in the cold in line for about 45 minutes, so I think i should be forgiven :) The decor is what I imagine it looked like when it first opened 80 years ago, minus some of the newspaper clippings on the walls.\nEveryone at our table had a classic smoked meat sandwich - I ordered lean and found it a little dry, so I added a touch more mustard. Those who had medium said the meat was perfect. The spice combination used here is different from what you'd find at other smoked meat places around the city.  The meat is flavourful, tender, and falls apart. The fries were good.  \nThe star of meal, you ask? A giant pickle! Quite possibly the best pickle I've ever had (and I consider myself a pickle connoisseur, even if nobody else does). I wanted to stop next door at the take out counter to bring some pickles home, but the take out counter was closed. So I'll be back - the pickle is worth waiting in line.",242,3

My wife, daughter (16), son (19) and I slipped into our goin' to town duds and we were off.  Considering the generous amount on the gift card, we thought we were in for treat. We used to be Roy's regulars at the Scottsdale location, but that was quite some time ago, and we were in for some surprises.  My wife had been thinking of sushi all week, but except for one quasi-roll, Roy's no longer serves it, so that's what my wife settled for. My Daughter ordered the short rib, and my son and I splurged, or so we thought, on the surf and turf which was billed as a petit filet and half a poached lobster. I understand petit, and I didn't expect an Aussie tail and an 8 ounce filet but what we got was shocking. If our filet's were 4 oz's I'll eat my hat, (which is about 8 oz). 3 bites and it was gone, the lobster would have been a decent sized prawn, 3 slivers of asparagus, a tablespoon of potatoes. I kept expecting Ashton Kutcher to pop up and tell me we were being punked. Again I didn't expect a Texas steak so big that \""If you eat it it's free\"" but this was beyond the pail. I've eaten all over the world, I'm somewhat experienced.  I moved what little there was around my plate and then pretended that I was full from the calamari appetizer. I gave my son half of my steak, (1.5 bites) and all of my lobster tail. It was just appalling. My daughters meal was wonderful and my wife enjoyed the roll, we both had a glass of wine and we still had to cough up $140. on top of the $100 Gift Card. I left the place feeling like Clark Griswold after those Arizona Mechanics emptied his wallet for those 4 bald tires. Totally screwed. It was my Wife's birthday so I kept a smile on my face as we strolled around the beautiful Marriott grounds after dinner, then drove us home and made myself a sandwich.",515,0
"My party of 4 had an unfortunate incident at the restaurant here. Went for breakfast but was told at the hostess stand that there is a dress code for men, no sleeveless shirts! My friend had a very nice sleeveless shirt on, so they offered him a free T-shirt to wear while dining. It was a 3XL wrinkled shirt. He wears size Medium. Ridiculous !! So we left -- and by the way, dress code DOES NOT apply to women!! DISCRIMINATION !!!!!!",100,0
"First time eating at a JJ's and it was an unsatisfactory one. We ordered a sub which was about $6.50 each after tax. The guy at the cashier had no customer service skills at all. We were a bit confused but he just rushed us and didn't even offer drinks or a combo meal or something like that. Also, there were a bunch of employees in the station and they were just plain loud talking nonsense. With regards to their subs, it was not worth it. It was literally just some meat, bread, lettuce, and tomatoes. There were more flavor from the packaged deli meat at the grocery store. At least I now know not to bother with this place again.",144,0
"From what I understand, Yelp is to review unique and fun places, not your typical everyday joints. For this review, and those rules, please accept my apology. What I have to say must be heard.\n\nYou see, Arby's is an amazing place. It is lumped in with the McDonalds and Burger Kings of the world, when in fact, it should hold a different place in the hearts of Americans. \n\nWhen I was 16 years old I landed my first real paper paycheck job at an Arby's in Holland, MI. I thought I was big time. I made $8.00 an hour. I scored free grub from time to time. I flirted with the lizadies who came through the drive through window. What else could you want? \n\nThrough my time at Arby's I learned a man named Russ Umphimheimer owns the most Arby's under an umbrella corporation called RTM. He also owned a few other joints I think a Hardees (never seen one), a breakfast roll place, etc. Arby's was his crowning achievement though. He owned an empire of roast beef and curly fries. I met him once and shook his hand. He had a bunch of gold rings. \n\nAnyway, now you have the background of my review, and you see I am only giving this joint 2 stars, you have to wonder why. I will tell you why..  no green beans on the menu.\n\nThrough out parts of the mid-west and the south there are renegade rebel Arby's. They were not bought out by RTM during Russ Umphenhimer's Arby's empire take over. Think of these places as the rebel alliance in Star Wars, and the RTM Arby's as The Empire. Russ Umphenhimer can be Darth Vader if you want him to be, but he's really not that mean. \n\nRTM (stands for Results Through Motivation) set a menu standard through out his millions of Arby's. Every menu had to be the same. You can always tell when you are in a rebel Arby's because they will have some random stuff on the menu, such as green beans. The franchisee operator will sell you green beans (at least they used to), but hardly any of the Arby's would order them because they were all RTM Arby's and thus, couldn't be free to set the menu as they saw fit. \n\nThis Arby's had it's typical roast beef sandwiches. I opted for the beef and cheddar sans red ranch sauce, cause I think it's gross and I saw somebody dump a whole tub on their head once and run around chasing a girl. Bad juju right there. I also ordered the chicken fingers, which are back on the menu after a couple year MIA stint. Topped it off with an order of curly fries and a jamoca shake. I can't spell jamoca. Sorry. \n\nThe food I ordered was great for a fast food joint, and worth the extra dollar to upgrade me from a whopper or big mac. However, to have a truly 5 star Arby's experience, I lust for the day where I can order green beans off of a fast food menu and have a hearty chuckle about this fact. Until this day, fight The Empire, and support your local rebel Arby's (they usually have those old signs \""Arby's Rost Beef Sandwich is Delicious\"").",749,1
"Baby... Ellis Island,\n\nSo you've decided to get a divorce and take away my deals??\n\nYou had me at $4.99 when we met in 2010. Sure, we argued and I put up with your $3 increase by 2011 when you knew I was returning from a long hiatus. But now, you decided to pull a fast one and take it all away?\n\nNo... you've decided to be the hot one and call me out, keeping my babies of steak & eggs away and needing to sell out $12.99 for some even at 3AM?! You've just gone mad now. You've changed. WE'VE CHANGED. And now you've gone way too far.\n\nI found a new one to spend my nights of meat cravings elsewhere.

"We came here for the Fiesta Bowl and after the game for New Years Eve.  It was packed - but still the service was better then what I thought it would be for being so crowded.  I been here before, so new what to expect.  Love coming here before football games.  Always good sevice, great location, I got heir wings and chicken quesadilla and was pleased.  Will be back for the Super Bowl.\n   I didn't think the price was costly for the food - and while it was New Years' Eve - I was disappointed that our group had to pay $25/person to just come in to eat dinner.  I know they had a DJ performing later - but $25.00 to just come in and eat seemed pricey - and although I could of left and went somewhere else - I didn't - and I knew about the charge up front - so I can't blame them for it.",197,3
"I stopped by for a quick drink with a couple friends the other night and it was pretty cool... \n\nSince I was already at another party and meeting some folks after they took in a show, I ordered a regular drink instead of frozen... Honestly, I don't even remember the name of it because I had my cousin order it for me before I got there, but it was good... \n\nThe servers were all very nice and immediately greeted me when I arrived at the bar, which I love... (It annoys me to see people standing behind the bar, going through great pains not to acknowledge a patron...) These guys were incredibly friendly... \n\nThere was a DJ, too... He played some pop music and it seemed to go over okay with the crowd... It was a decent time, but I'm not really into the clubby bar scene, so I won't be back for that... They do have improv comedy in the back room a couple nights a week, though, so I'll absolutely be in attendance at some point...",221,2
"I love Gordon Ramsay and really wanted to try the Beef Wellington. I did, but it just wasn't my thing. I Loved, Loved, Loved the asparagus side dish with pistachio pesto. Sooooooo good.

"This will be a very mixed review.\n\nExcellent: Chips and salsas. Yum. STRONG margaritas (I passed out so hard afterwards at the chairs outside Starbucks that my wife couldn't wake me up for like 20 minutes...at lunchtime). Nice server lady who came to ask us (4 Asians) how we knew what mole sauce was and was all impressed we had been to Mexico, etc. Oh and good mole sauce. Nice mariachi band.\n\nNot so good: We kind of got deceived into thinking we were ordering 2 for 1 margaritas for $12. She brought it in 4 glasses since there were 4 of us (though we thought we had only ordered 2) so we thought she had split it for us on purpose. Turned out she charged us $24 for 4 margaritas. That sucked. (but like I said it was a good margarita). \n\nThough our server lady was pretty nice, the manager was not. Also, in general, the price was a bit painful. Plus, ambience in the Luxor is...well dark and cold...kind of like how dead Egyptian pharaohs would like it....not how chipper Mexican cantinas generally are.\n\nI would come back to just have a margarita (ONE and only ONE) and those chips and salsa though.",281,2
"I don't have anything to say about the hotel since I haven't stayed there yet, but I did try the buffet...  Yes, of all things at the Wynn, we ended up eating at their buffet.  Supposedly, they had an abundant amount of crab legs but we never found it.  \n\nI'm not a big fan of buffets and even the Wynn's buffet didn't do anything to change my mind.  Yes, they serve a ton of food, but for the price you pay, it's not worth it.  There was nothing spectacular about  the food (it was neither terrible nor memorable)  and the service was atrocious!   \n\nI should've learned my lesson a long time ago...  No buffets!  Anywhere.  Not even Vegas.  Not even at the Wynn.  Period.",185,1
"I agree with 2 other reviews that their prices are reasonable. However after setting up an appointment, I contracted food poisoning after eating in a restaurant and had to call them with 4 hours notice to postpone the appointment. Their office manager went ballistic with anger and accused me of being undependable and inferred that I was lying, and insisted that I come in for the appointment anyway even though I was vomiting and had diaarrea. When I refused, he stated that I was no longer a patient there and he was also cancelling my girlfriends appoinment in which her services had already been started and an appliance had already been made.\n\nIn my opinion this type of behavior is very unprofessional and bodes very poorly regarding any others that are considering doing business with them. I do not recommend them.",164,0

Great golf at the south end of the strip.  Super friendly staff.  Interesting course with great views of Las Vegas and planes taking off and landing.   Don't play here if the planes bother you.  The service here is outstanding and the course is well kept and fun.  Great day here - we loved it.,68,4

"Place went down hill fast!!  We went when they opened and they were ok we enjoyed it. Came back again and this will be the last time for sure. The pizza guys (students) suck. They have no idea what to do and are completely clueless to what the toppings were! They were keeping the stems on the Calabrese peppers, when I said please take them off they said that's how we do things here. The place is trying to be artisanal but are doing a terrible job. I will drive the extra mile to settabello or pizza rock downtown, (they are the best btw )Done with these fakes! Btw: I asked where is chef Marc? The reply? He hardly comes in anymore! Lol #done. Obviously they are dying, the place was empty during the normal dinner rush! Lol it's going to be fun to see who moves in this spot when they leave. Stay away!",189,0

Not that thats the reason I go to get sangrias, but cmon! And the taste was just off.. The nachos didnt have alot of 'stuff' on them.. havent had that in the past either.. and the waitress messed up the order.. the girl who delivered the nachos quickly remedied it.. but nonetheless.. maybe next time..",169,1
"Disappointing compared to previous visit 2 years ago. Came for my birthday brunch. Ordered a side of Hollandaise which had curdled. Cutlery was dirty, was never given/offered a hot water refill for my tea and the waitress answer to \""our ketchup bottle leaked all over our table, clothes and food\"" was \""can I bring you another bottle?\"" We had to ask for extra napkins. She was courteous but clearly inexperienced. Note to management, your patio tables and chairs are nice but the tables are too high for your chairs. I'm tall and still felt awkward trying to eat. Would take much convincing to return.",131,1
"Best sushi spot in vegas by FAR!!! Eric, Soo, and JJ are amazing chefs and make everything like a piece of art. Its the type of place you go and people are taking pictures of the plates.  You walk in and are greeted by Eric yelling HAAAASHHHAAAI from behind the bar.  The rolls are all amazing and fresh, but the best thing to do is just sit at the bar and leave your ordering in the hands of Eric, and JJ.  Just let them make something and you will not leave anything short of satisfied.  Make sure you order a sake bomb with Eric, and watch him smash it for you, its worth the price alone.",139,4
"Edit: This location has now been open for several months and my previous grievances has been resolved.  It's now a pleasure to come here in the mornings and my order is always filled in a timely manner. \n\nI was delighted when I found out this Starbucks location was opening. I work down the street so I thought this would become a regular stop for me on my morning commute.\n\nThe employees of this location have all been very nice and welcoming, however, the morning crew really needs a stronger manager to be working with them. I stopped frequenting this location because of the snail like pace of the service. No matter if I go through the drive thru or walk into the store the team can never complete my order in a timely manner.\n\nThe order I am having trouble with consists of a medium coffee and a breakfast sandwich. Obviously the coffee is given to me immediately, but the breakfast sandwich has always taken at least 15 minutes to get to me and usually cold. Somehow my order always seems to get lost amongst the employees.",218,3
"I  am in love with this hotel!! We booked the 2 bedroom suite with is perfect is you have 5 or more ppl in your group. This included 2 totally separate bedrooms w/ their own bathrooms and a sofa bed that comfortably sleeps 2 ppl. The rooms include a full kitchen as well! They have a great free breakfast every morning. It gets pretty busy so the earlier you get there, the better.  The staff is super friendly and everything is clean. The pool is a good size with lounge chairs. They even provide some pool toys for the kids. Its about a 15 minute drive to the strip so its a little far if you are going to take a taxi but the hotel has a shuttle that can fit 7 ppl at a time. This is thee perfect family friendly hotel!! I will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Vegas. I actually prefer the fact that it is away from the strip and the casinos. This way, you can go visit the strip and gamble but you get to come back to a quiet place to relax.",220,4
"I do not fly domestic enough to know what is the Standard. So take that with a grain of salt.\n\nI will not fly US airways again. Overall just unhappy staff. Never got a smile once from any of them.

Yes 3 Minutes later they announce that all remaining carry on's must be checked.. FOR FREE.  lol Thanks guys. Real nice work.\n\nI got an isle seat. Somehow it was broken, so I am slouching toward the isle for 2 hours. No Belt buckle for Infant on lap, such as International Flights require during turbulence.\n\nFlight attendants were ok, but again no smiling other than making eye contact with my infant son.\n\nThen of course 20 minutes before landing, they advertise to us some ridiculous deal about a flight to hawaii if if you sign up for their credit card.

I've tried Chinese restaurants all over Madison trying to find my go to place and I've felt underwhelmed most of the time. \nBecause Orient House is one of the few places that delivers to my house, I eventually gave them a try and I am so glad that I did because not only are there unusual (more traditional) dishes on their menu that you can't really find anywhere else here, but the prices are are very affordable! And the classic dishes are exceptional. \nI really love the Shrimp Ho Fun and the Walnut Chicken.",147,4

"Cuco's is a decent place.  The food is pretty consistently decent.  The service is decent and their drinks are decent.  I have had a lot of things on their menu and the food is far from authentic but it's decent.  They also have decent margaritas.  One thing that I'm not in love with at Cuco's is how overly salted everything is.  There is really not much to say outside of just noting that the place is decent. \n\nOne thing that is kind of standout at the restaurant however is this dish that comes in a stone pig shaped pot.  It has chicken, chorizo, steak, and shrimp and is served with avocado slices and rice with beans.  It's pretty freaking good.  It's also pretty freaking salty but still really good.  It is enough for 2 people which should mean that the man and I split it.  But it doesn't.  He eats all he can and looks forward to taking the rest home for breakfast the next day.  He does let me have a few bites of it, only sometimes though!\n\nIf you want decent Mexican food and a decent atmosphere with decent service come to Cuco's you won't be disappointed.",263,2
Have a crave for the pork dumplings one night and came here. There aren't a lot of restaurants in Vegas that offer that dish. Ordered a pork dumplings with supreme soup combo. I actually like the chicken soup they have. The pork dumplings are just alright.  My boyfriend ordered Mongolian beef but they gave us Mongolian lamb instead....Didn't bother to ask for a change because we are in a hurry. Food deserves 3.5 stars\n\nService- there's only one server at that time... It's slow and she is not really attentive. Asked for our bill few times and she still couldn't see us.  2 stars! \n\nWhat's worse is after I went home.... My throat felt so dry...Ah... Bet it's all the MSG in the soup!,170,2

Unfortunately, our server acted like she was slammed even though there were only a couple tables in the whole restaurant. I never got a refill on my drink and I didn't feel like she really cared about our dining experience. The fish tacos themselves were just okay. The fish was good, pretty fishy-tasting like I like, but they needed a sauce of some sort to make them perfect. I found myself really wanting Wahoo's while I was eating there. I've heard the happy hour is pretty good here so I might come back in the future to give it a go.",157,2
"I had lunch here and ordered Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare, Trevi's signature dish. I was not impressed at all. It was a tad bland and not worth the $28.95 price tag.

I kept reminding him that we weren't at the old fashioned.) my sister-in-law had the croque madame, and, with some prodding, my brother ordered the chicken and waffles. I tried a bite of these dishes and liked both. the chicken and waffles was pretty amazing and I will definitely order this dish next time. \n\nas if we weren't already stuffed, we shared a chocolate croissant and some coffee cake after our meal. both were good but not amazing. \n\nall in all, this is a solid place for brunch and we'll definitely be back.",262,3

"I've only been to PCL with promoters though they've all graduated and left Arizona by now. This was great because I used to be easily annoyed and definitely wouldn't  bother waiting on lines or paying for drinks.

Now that I'm twenty one, I can thankfully go out wherever I want but I'd return here time and time again for those reasons. Though I don't expect drinks from guys now that I've spent so much time in Australia I do expect lines. America's so much more populated than half the countries I've been to recently. I swear, I always feel like I'm on a cue. Apologies for my digression here.. \n\nWhen I've been to PCL it's always an interesting scene. You can find young college kids who have all piled into big orange buses and made their way over from Tempe OR the 35+ single creepy guy who wants a piece of some ASU chick. There are pros and cons, obviously. \n\nYou can count on the DJ being good which adds to the all around great atmosphere. If you don't know, I love hip-hop and they've usually got a perfect mix between this and house. My favorite thing about this place are the  ceiling screens that usually have picture of hot almost naked chicks ;) \n\nIt's also awesome to go out to PCL and find pictures of yourself up on their site after a messy weekend. Check their website out for specific deets in regards to special dates  and DJ's coming into town.",348,2

"Would have given 4-5 stars if not for the unacceptable, rude, and appalling service here.  I've never wanted to punch a bartender in the face more than I did here. I have had bad experiences in the bar a couple times before, but this last Saturday takes the cake!  first I get a completely different drink than I ask for, when I kindly ask for the correct drink, Miss witch-bartender gets upset with me, cuffs the biggest attitude and even yells at me telling me she gave me what I asked for, stomps off, tosses my correct drinks on the counter, and on top of that, overcharges me!!\n By far the poorest excuse for a bartender I've ever encountered. It's a shame too, because the place is gorgeous, one of the nicest spots in Old Town, and pretty good eye candy.

"I was so excited to see another non-chain eatery open in our neighborhood. My first visit was great and each time thereafter has gotten a bit worse. \n\nVisit #1 - I ordered a BLT - it was great - piled high with bacon and the fries were steak-cut and cooked perfectly. \n\nVisit #2 - I ordered a 4 cheese flat-bread over the phone. She insisted that she needed my credit card number for phone orders (which I don't like doing over the phone for security purposes). Upon picking up my order, I had to wait 15 minutes to get to the counter to pick up my food because of the line. By the time I got home (I live 1.3 miles away), my food was cold. On top of the coldness, the flat-bread was not covered with cheeses (the outer inch and a half had no cheese on it and was hard as a rock). A $5 grab and go pizza from Little Caesars (which I dont like) would have been better\n\nVisit #3- ordered the BLT again because I wanted to eat something I knew I liked. This time, they only had 2 pieces of bacon on each half of the sandwich. The bread to bacon ratio was far to low... disappointing. On top of that, the fries were undercooked and soggy. Doubly disappointing. \n\nVisit #4- I ordered the sliders. However, after tasting my husband's Mac n Cheese during our last visit, I asked for the fries instead of the mac n cheese (the mac is dry, clumped together, and bland). And, of course they messed it up. They substituted the onion straws for the fries instead of the mac, so I got the fries and the mac. The mac was gross, just as it was the last visit and the fries were undercooked and soggy... also like the last visit. \n\nThree strikes and you're out, The Spot. I shall not be returning.",420,0

However, even with reservations, they didn't have our table prepared and us seated until 15 minutes past our reservation time. No complimentary appetizers or drinks for making us wait??\n\nOne person in the group got the grilled salmon, which was small, bland, dry, and worse than anything she could've made at home. Definitely not worth the 35 bucks or however much it costed. Never getting fish at a steakhouse again.\n\nNow, the main reason as to why I'm writing this review, to critique the steak. The number one factor for what makes or breaks a steak for me is FLAVOR, which this 52 dollar steak had NONE of. Sure they had that not so good sauce on the side that you could slather your steak in, but for me, the perfect steak just needs salt and pepper and rubbed with spices. The single redeeming factor is that the meat is truly tender. I rested my fork on it and the prongs started sinking into the meat!\n\nI agree the most with Chad P.'s review. Too bad I didn't listen to him over all the overwhelming 5 star reviews.\n\nBlacklisted",268,1
Thought I wouldn't like this place. But it turns out I did. Didn't opt for the all you can eat since my date and I wasn't that hungry. Next time I got to try the all you can eat!,50,3
"Lo and behold! Going to this Ross at 8pm on a Friday is like Happy Hour! (minus the booze, add lots of energetic, verbal tykes).\n\nNot a fancy Ross locale, I'll agree with other reviewers. Not the best customer service. (They cannot, for example, help you carry anything to your car. Other locations do. Bring friends if you buy something big.)\n\nHowever, they sell stuff for cheap.The merchandise turns over regularly. The aisles are fairly well maintained. \n\nParking can be very, very difficult IF you need to park close. (There is a very large lot. However, there are a number of other big chain stores in the strip.) \n\nWalk my friends! Walk. Oh wait.\nYou have to carry stuff to your car.\n\nEh.",179,2
"I put in an order for delivery at this place (I'd never eaten there before). I ordered sesame chicken and orange chicken. On the phone they said the wait would be about 45 minutes. An hour and a half later, it finally arrived. \nI opened the boxes and the food looked alright. I took my first bite to find it was very tough, almost like an overdone steak. The chicken was very dark brown, like they're using the chicken scraps that no other restaurant wants. I thought maybe that was just a bad bite, but as I ate a couple more bites, it just kept getting tougher. \nI then called them, telling them about my dissatisfaction. The host tells me \""let me find the receipt. I'll call you back. I'm busy right now\"" which kind of agitated me. However, I let it slide. I got no callback. When I called back the next day, as soon as I explained the situation they HUNG UP ON ME. \nNot only was the food terrible, but the customer service was even worse! Needless to say, I will NEVER order from here again.",238,0
"RESTAURANT WEEK RIP OFF:\nPoor service for our party of 6. Two people served salad then we waited, then one person got calamari, then we waited, then one person got sushi, and then we waited then another person got sushi and the sixth person got nothing...after a while waiter went down to kitchen to bring another salad. THEN, repeat style of service all 6 entrees brought at different time and waiter told us we were supposed to share!?  At the same time we had poor service, there were 7 loud very drunk men making so much noise you could not have any conversation at all. They were adults pouring sake into wine glasses, into beer and making impossible to hear anything. Waiter said he told management, but nothing changed. They finished their meal and continued to bar to drink and shout at the top of their voices. Oh and the portion size...miniscule. Does this restaurant think it will last in Charlotte!  We may be  very polite, but we do not take rip off's very well.  \nIf you have a reservation here for restaurant week, Cancel it!",230,0
"The food here is worth all of the negatives- the wait, the service, the atmosphere. Sometimes you just need that hearty breakfast to start your day, and Palatte just won't succeed.\n\nI recommend everything here. Seriously, everything. Especially the Daily Specials.",58,4
"It's really hard finding a female OB/GYN here in Las Vegas. I went to see her at a very critical time- I was having problems with my pregnancy, it was my first, after all.\n\nI was on the very cusp of getting my health insurance coverage. (I was still in the probation period at my new job, and was to receive the benefits the following month.) It seemed as if she did not want to deal with me because I didn't have insurance, and was going to apply for medicaid. She was very cold and callous as I was going through this difficult time in my life- I ended up losing the baby. She showed me no empathy and didn't seem to care as a medical professional. I felt so terrible and it was worse by having her as a doctor- yes, she seemed capable but she was not a people person. When she told me the news that I had lost the baby, I don't even think that she felt badly- it was the delivery- how she told me- expressionless, like an \""Oh well.\""\n\nFast forward a few years later, I had heard women raving about her on the local Mark & Mercedes show on Mix 94.1 FM. I really wanted to set the record straight about her. (I am sharing my experience because maybe someone else will read this and will think twice about seeing her.) But apparently, someone on yelp.com already exposed her for her lack of communication skills.",311,0
"This hotel has a very well documented bedbug problem. I made a reservation for 2 rooms and then was told by a friend from Vegas that there was an infestation. I immediately cancelled the reservation.

"Went to lunch Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. The music was too loud and all the booth tables were occupied or dirty. I'm sure the workers would have rather been else where.

"I came in yesterday looking to buy jeans for work, and left with two shirts, two pairs of non work pants, two pairs of work jeans, a skirt, and shoes. The shoes were brand new doc martens (with tags and extra yellow laces) for $65! What a steal! I also brought in a fairly large amount of clothes, not expecting much since I haven't had luck selling here before, and made $45! They had interesting choice in what they took (I had about 10 pairs of designer jean shorts that they didn't touch, but they took my bow tie and large March Hare top hat from halloween?) But I can't complain about selling $45 worth of stuff!",149,4
"I was not real happy at this airport, there was no where to charge up my phone near my gate.  I hate to sit on the floor near the old phones on the wall and watch a bunch of people walk by.  I can't believe that an airport this busy hasn't upgraded their airport to help out those of us that are traveling and need to charge up phone and such.\n\nI have to stop here on my way back to Providence from ATL and really bummer by this.",104,1
"We just moved to the Glendale area, and were looking for somewhere other than the \""regulars\"" to deliver.  Hubby found this place on here, and they were friendly while ordering.\n\nWe went with the basic pizza/wings combo.  The pizza has a bread-like crust, which isn't my favorite, but it was really tasty.  Nothing against them, it's a personal preference.  I do like that they don't drown their pizza in sauce, the cheese was really good, too.\n\nBut, OMG...the wings!!  I fell in love with them.  Too bad I had to share the order with hubby, or I would've eaten all dozen of them...LOL!  We got the honey BBQ sauce, and it was amazing!  The wings are huge, too!  Just so good!!  (Can y'all tell that I really loved those wings??)",194,3
Love this place!!! It's a beautiful local market and it has an enormous Gluten Free Section!!! Reasonably priced too!,26,4
Aaaaaa-hole employees give the worst service you'll ever have. Unless you're blackout go elsewhere. They wouldn't give me a water for a dollar. $1.08. Ate the pizza dry as shit. Never again. Pizza was good though.,57,0
"(Lounge review Only)\n\nWhere to start. When people come to a place like this, they come for atmosphere. Unfortunately I don't think Japonais realizes that a calming asian atmosphere does not come clear open views of the casino and Laker games in the background, that is unless they wanted to mimic the atmosphere of Buffalo Wild Wings. People can get sushi anywhere, they come here for atmosphere which i felt little of; at least my wallet felt the burn of their half-assed attempt at relaxing asian atmosphere. \n\nThe price is beyond ridiculous for small portions of food that honestly, wasn't even that great. There rolls were terrible, especially the \""Philly Roll.\"" Their sushi was much better, but I think when paying that much I might as have gone to \""Tao,\"" which happens to understand what I meant when I say \""Atmosphere.\"" The only real charm in terms of food was a delicious appetizer known as \""The Rock.\"" Six or Five thin cut slices of well marinated meat that you cook on your own on a 600 degree rock. Which, as delicious as it was, puts you in quite a dilemma your cheap like me. You would like to take your time and savor each bite, but it is literally a race against time for you as you try to cook each piece of meat thoroughly before it loses its heat and your left with raw meat. \n\nI understand it's Vegas and money should never be issue of I should expect to spend A LOT. But when spending that much i should have a waitress that does not give an attitude, warns us that out next ordered beers do not count as happy hour because she served them after \""Happy Hour,\"" and she should also tell us the edamame that she gave us, yet we didn't order, we are being charged for. \n\nThe best part of the the night there was the Lakers winning their game, which may contradict my complaints of being able to view the game, but I really am trying to find a positive here and not be completely negative. Well, the place is clean, but so is my house, it's also free.",444,0
What a cool place!!  We went here on a Wednesday night and got the flatbread pizza and sliders.  Both were very good.\n\nWill be returning here soon because it's just a cool place to hang out!!\n\nHopefully the Arts District expands here in Vegas.  Really like the vibe!!,68,2
"So I love Bomberos. I like the fire pit, and the trees, and the decor. But the thing I love the most is the atun escabeche(sp). Salty, sweet, and delicious. \n As a side note, my 7 year old daughter loves to come here to hang out and read, apparently Junie B. Jones books fit in really well with the ham and cheese sandwich.\n I highly recommend it.",92,3

"I haven't been to Chili's in a while. I usually love it, but this past Sunday my Mom and I went and it was bad! From the service to the food. All of it not good!\n\nWe started off with the bottomless chips and salsa. This was the only good thing about the experience. I also checked in on Foursquare and noticed I got a free bottomless chips and salsa with check-in I asked our waitress about it. She had no clue about it at all. She even said that she had never seen it before and had me read her off the coupon code. The chips were surprisingly light and very tasty and the salsa was pretty fresh. \n\nFor lunch I decided to have their new Bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich. It came on a pretzel  bun, with tiny bits of sauteed onion, very none existent cilantro pesto mayo and fries. It looked really pretty and looked like it was going to be really yummy. Alas, I was wrong. So very tasteless! The whole thing just had no flavor and needed some serious sauce. I tasted none of the mayo at all. Even the fries tasted bad. \n\nMy Mom ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger. Again, it looked really yummy and was huge, but was flavorless. She also said it was mushy in the middle and the ancho-chilie BBQ sauce was not on there at all!\n\nWhen the sever brought us our food we asked for a couple of sides of ranch for our fries. She said no problem. I ate half of my sandwich and had given up on the ranch and was using ketchup before we finally got our ranch. Both of our fries were cold by the time it came and then it wasn't even our server that brought it to us! \n\nChili's you disappointed me. From your servers to your food: meh! I feel I totally wasted my money and time! I should have just gone to Rachel's Kitchen where I know the food has taste and is yummy!",422,1
"Sorry but there is always a wait here but you'll just have to get over that because this place is so frikin delicious! They serve pancakes with ice cream on it!!! Ive tried the cherries jubilee and bananas foster pancakes with the honey wheat pancakes I believe it is and bananas foster definitly better but it depends which you prefer because both were fan frikin tastic.  (im sure only like 5 calories too right??, ha ) And I have also had the eggs benedict with the portabello mushroom on it (don't remember what it was called) I dont eat meat so I get it with out it and with out the other sauce it comes with, but still get the hollandaise and man, its good! It has a little spice to it and I love spice.  The iced green tea is yummy also. The servings are big so you can always order to share (or if you cant decide, order a couple things and  share everything) When the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside. All in all, love this place!",219,4
"Tonkotsu might get four stars, the shio and miso/tonkotsu two or three.  Too salty, noodles were a little soft and I personally prefer the curly kind (rather than the round, straight kind at Monta). Pork was good, soft boiled egg was pretty good.\n\nPersonally I like the small, crowded restaurant.  It seems to somehow be the right ambiance for a ramen shop.",86,2
"For someone who has mixed feelings about zoos in general, I have to say that WWZ was pretty damn cool. I've lived in Phoenix since '95 and I just went for the first time. What is that nonsense! It's like a hidden gem that no one talks about. \n\nAdmittedly, the parking lot and area where you pay to get in are a little ghetto, but it gets so much better so quickly! The variety of critters is amazing and, for the most part, they do appear to have enough room and comfortable quarters (although I worry about them in the summer heat). The exhibits are such that you can get literally within touching distance to most of the animals, and in turn the animals are pretty mellow -- hanging out nice and close, not frightened of their admirers. So cool to see some of these gorgeous creatures so close! \n\nThe aquariums are pretty cool too, although in general things without fur or feathers freak me out. Lots of hands-on exhibits, where you can touch stingrays, starfish, crabs, and the like if you are so inclined (I was so not). \n\nI'm a sucker for the petting zoo, where I thoroughly enjoyed being raped by twelve goats and two deer. Those bastards are aggressive and had no qualms about gnawing on my fingers, jacket, and rings when my little goat kibbles were all gone. Oh, but they're so cute. I wanted to take one of the twee little pygmy goats and stick it in my bag. \n\nFeeding the giraffes was another highlight. It's just so much better to be able to get up so close and personal to the creatures.\n\nThe best part is that it wasn't very crowded, although the inclement weather probably helped with that. I hate battling all the overexcited bratty children at places like this, but really, it was mellow. The admission cost is about what I expected ($27 ish?), and same goes for the cost and quality of the food. The food is cash only, be 'ware!",434,4
"I was coming in from out of town for a wedding.  I wanted a full service salon.  I booked a massage and paid for 90 minutes.  What I got was a so-so massage and construction noise from next door, drilling, nailing, talking all during the massage.  Why book massages if that will happen, at least could have told me beforehand.\nI then had my eyebrows waxes and she pulled part of skin off and I have scabs. Had a shampoo and blowout and the person told me she didnt do blowouts but was going to try!? Really?  Mani and Pedi were mediocre.  Would never go back.",136,0
"I guess the renovation is nearing completion, as we had none of the negative renovation-type experiences expressed by others via Yelp.\n\nIf you're into the modern/contemporary look and planning a short stay, this might be a good option for you.  This was a very fancy looking hotel at a price that was lower than other such hotels in downtown Charlotte.\n\nThe staff was friendly.  We had a spectacular view of the city, were located within walking distance of most of Charlotte's highlights, and the beds were like sleeping on a cloud: they were ridiculously comfortable.\n\nThat's not to say that the Blake was without some awkwardness, particularly, as echoed by others, when considering the showers.  I think they need another go 'round on the design: you have to be in the shower to turn it on and I think they could have splurged for a SLIDING glass door instead of a stationary panel that only covers half the shower.  The lighting/outlet controls were like solving the mysteries to Pan's Labyrinth, and the surprise $13 parking fee (for one night) was a bit of a let down.\n\nOtherwise this was a viable option and for a one night stay, totally serviceable.",260,2
"So incredibly happy to have found this place! Yay YELP!!!!  My husband and I come from NJ/NYC area where good Korean food was plentiful.  Since moving here to Arizona, we have had such difficulty finding our ethnic restaurants, including Korean restaurants. Thanks to the fellow yelpers, this small mom and pop restaurant was exactly what we were looking for since we have made our move.   And I must admit, the soft tofu soup with seafood (Haemul Soon Du Bu) was better than the ones back home.  The bimbim bap was also amazingly delicious, as was the spicy squid with veggies (Oh Jing Uh Bokeum).  The Banchan (little dishes) also hit the spot as they were all equally tasty and spicy.  The service was great and we love our waitress!  In fact, she informed us that within a couple of weeks, they will be receiving their liquor license along with karaoke.  I don't care much for the bad singing, but I am happy to be drinking Soju soon and have some Bonchon (fried Korean chicken) to wash it down with...WINNING!",232,4
"I wish that Yelp would let you give stars on specific aspects of the experience and then average a star rating because parts of my Breakfast Buffet experience were decent and parts were terrible.\n\nFirst the good:\n\nThe food, it was good.  Nothing spectacular, but exactly what I expected from a buffet at the Flamingo.  Decent variety, food was fresh.  I had eggs about 300 ways (with chorizo, rancheros, breakfast burrito, benedict) and they were all good.  The shrimp cocktail was the bomb, the chocolate fountain was just kitschy enough to be fun.  I wouldn't complain.  I left full and ate nothing that was disappointing.\n\nThe blah:\nThe price.  Right at $50 for 2 Breakfast buffets, food only.  Not worth it.  I can't eat that much for breakfast, and I know how much eggs cost.  Breakfast buffets should never run over $20 bucks unless I can get lobster, and maybe bottomless mimosas.\n\nThe bad:\nThe service!   The women working the cash registers were rude.  Our server was incredibly overwhelmed, which was not the real problem.  The problem was the other servers in other areas refusing to step in and help out.  All we needed to drink were waters.  It took us 20 minutes to get water.  I tried to flag down 3 servers outside of our own who was serving tables as fast as she could and I was shrugged of by each although their areas were obviously slower than ours.  That was a major disappointment.  Our server was incredibly polite and apologetic about the wait and once she caught herself up, was very attentive.  But overall there was a lack of team work to keep things flowing and customers happy.\n\nOverall I was happy with the food, but for 25 bucks a head I feel like I can expect decent customer service as well.  That was lacking and I would not go back or recommend this buffet to others because of this.  Sorry Flamingo, you have to do better.",440,1
"Burgers are ok. The ribeye and mashed potatoes were flavorless. Stay in the restaurant area, your clothes will smell like smoke in the bar. The waitstaff and bartenders are cool. I probably won't be back.",49,1

"I went here for happy hour drinks and tacos. Drinks were good. I have a few Beers( which a generally good) and their house margarita. I have certainly had better margs other places, but it was by no means bad. Middle of the road. It was however dirt cheap. $2.50. \n\nDecent Chips, Ok salsa\n\nI order the two tacos with chicken. They came out less than 5 minutes later and the were yummy. They were not worth $7 though. I would say more like $4 MAX.\n\nOverall I will come back here for drinks, maybe get an appetizer. The food was on the more expensive side for what you get. Just an FYI. They have loads of different kinds of tequila. If that is your thing check it out. The place is in a strip mall type place next to the Cox Store, but had a Urban hip-ness on the inside.",196,3

"This mom and pop style neighborhood pizza joint is located in a gas station, old baseball pictures on the walls, good pizza for the price the staff is really chill. This place won't disappoint you, much better than the garbage at cici's or any corporate pizza place. The wings are really good and they also have pizza by the slice. If you live in the area, this should be your usual pizza spot. It's an old school spot not really meant for the whole family to come and eat but more of a take out New York style pizza joint or maybe good to eat a slice there and BS with staff.",129,4
"I can say I enjoyed my visit to this establishment. The restaurant is tiny and gets very busy quickly. I would recommend coming when they open to avoid the long wait. \nThe broth for the ramen comes in 3 different choices: shoyu, shio and miso. I had ordered the miso Screaming for Vengeance ramen bowl. It had chashu pork, menma, seaweed and bean sprouts. It's supposedly the most spiciest ramen in Las Vegas. I can say it wasn't nearly close to being spicy that burned. It had a slight kick but it wasn't, by my standard, spicy. But the broth was very tasty. It was a pork based miso broth. I slurped up the entire large bowl I had ordered. I loved the texture of the noodles. It wasn't too chewy and it certainly wasn't over-cooked. It was perfect to me. Perfectly chewy and enjoyable. The chashu pork was melt-in-your-mouth goodness. \nI recommend anyone checking this place out of you're in the area.",224,3
"Service was good, food was over-salted (not over seasoned because it lacked flavor). I attempted to come again bit they were charging for the super bowl as if they paid to stream it. prices are very steep in comparison to other wing places. $.85 a wing is unheard of, I'm used to paying 50 to 6 cents a wing.",77,2
Great omelet and pancakes. I love their whipped cream!!! Whipped cream at this restaurant makes everything taste extra delicious.,25,3
"Great chicken burrito. Even though I didn't get the enthusiastic greeting that everybody else received, the guy behind the counter at about 7:30pm did eventually give me some samples of one meat and that jalapeno cream cheese too. The cream cheese and both of the salsa's at the salsa bar were all in the hot category, even the green one that normally is mild. Go for the pico de Gallo if you don't like things too hot like myself. The beef in red sauce also had a hefty kick, but the chicken was composed of huge chunks of white meat that the cook put back on the grill before piling it atop my custom made burrito that was in progress.\n   These things stand out here:\n1. Chipotle tortilla (choice of 4 others too)\n2. Roasted Corn to put inside the burrito\n3. Homemade Horchata\n4. Free Homemade Chips with your order\n\nThis guy knows how to roll one too. The ingredients were all super fresh and the burrito was one of the better ones I have come across. It's in a strip mall and it just says Taqueria on the outside, but this is my new go-to fast Mexican place. It will blow away any chain and my total bill was $8.18 for the burro and drink. Thanks to previous Yelpers for uncovering this local gem.",284,4

"Great place if you are out shopping and want to get everything in one store or just for a browse to kill off a bit of time.

Not the cheapest place but then again you wouldn't expect it to be given location and building it's in.",86,2
"We ate here one night and drank beers another night.  It's located in the New York, NY Casino.  This is not your typical Irish pub that pops up in every town lately.  The food here is traditional Irish or English, i.e. Shepard's Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, etc.  No chicken wings, potato skins, burgers, etc. that these new \""irish\"" pubs serve here.  Food is pricey but everything in Vegas costs money.  The bar even has partitions just like in Ireland shielding you from your neighbors.  The beer selection is excellent.  Nice and cold, and served in Imperial pint glasses.  The bar tenders are fast on the draw when your pint is almost empty.  \n\nDownsides, for dinner it's very LOUD with bands cranking out tunes while you eat.  Don't expect to have a quiet, intimate conversation.  But, when your sitting at the bar, the sound is fine.  The service is excellent.  We saw two different bands from Ireland and the place was packed but not overcrowded.  $5 dollar cover charge to get in when the bands were playing.  Overall, pretty good for dining if you want traditional Irish food and excellent for drinking!",260,3
"The Mob Museum was one of those places we've wanted to go when in Vegas and finally had the time this last visit.  The museum is 3 floors with a lot of helpful and friendly staff members.\n\nWe spent a good 3 hours here.  The only thing I was disappointed about was that most of the displays were either written information or videos and I was hoping for more static displays.  We did learn a lot and the gem of the museum in my opinion is the actual execution wall from the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  That was truly cool.\n\nIf you take your kids, keep in mind that some of the audio or written explanations contain curses words for authenticity.",147,3
"Here's the thing about breakfast food. There's not a lot of variety, so ideally, yours should be better than the next guy's. In this, Breakfast Club fails. \n\nFood isn't bad, but they've never made that 4oz. $8.00 \""Harris Ranch\"" filet well. I've boiled steak in the UK that tastes just as good for half the price. \n\nAlso, never have coffee here. Not at least their bar drinks. It's horrible, and the person taking your order will repeat it back to you to correctly three times, but you won't get the drink you ordered.\n\nIt's trendy little spot in the Old Town Scottsdale area, but that's about it.",165,1
This Kmart is a good but not great store.  This location is one of the smaller locations in town and really doesn't compare IMHO to the Target super store or Wal-Mart (besides parking; yuk) when it comes to selection and value.,53,1
"What can I say, I love Marshalls. This location is clean and always filled with a ton of great finds. My only complaint (hence the 4 stars) is that they don't have a jewelry counter. I came here to find a cute necklace for my boyfriend's mother for her birthday. NOTHING like that in this store. I settled on a cute tank for myself, but still left with no present for her. \n\nOverall, if you;re a fan of Marshalls, you'll be a fan of this location.",115,3
This place has the best grass fed beef around. And they take pride in all that they sell. We have not had a bad piece of meat from here.. flavorful beef!  A little pricey but that's because of their wonderful products.,50,4
"As a new downtowner in employment, I've been scanning the possibilities for reasonably priced AND filling decent lunches, and have found my choices to be somewhat limited. I'd passed Frederick's on my route to the bank several times per week, and decided to give it a go.\n\nMy first time in was pretty successful. So much so that I raved about it back in the office, and then took a co-worker there for a second try, and was intensely let down.\n\nSo I'm starting off by saying that Frederick's is hit-or-miss, depending on the day.\n\nOn my first visit, I walked into an empty restaurant, checked out the menu, and was in the mood for some good ol' fried chicken. The young gal behind the register was VERY sweet and helpful, and I ordered a three-piece dark with fries, and a diet Coke. The guys in the back were friendly and welcoming, fried it up fresh while I waited, and I had a nice $8 lunch in ten minutes. Took it back to the office, and thoroughly enjoyed me some dynamite fried chicken.  The outside was crispy and tasty with that kind of bacon-like flavor that you can get when the skin is fried right, and the meat was juicy and flavorful. The fries were very basic, not even salted, but they were overall fine. I had a very pleasant experience and planned to return.\n\nSo for the second visit, I took my co-worker, and after my rave about the chicken, she decided to try that, with a side of mac-n-cheese. I was in the mood for just fish, and envisioned a nice slab of fried fish smothered in tartar sauce that would be as awesome as the chicken. Another co-worker had asked if they had greens, and after a scan of the menu, I decided to surprise her with an order.\n\nMy co-worker ordered her chicken breast and side, and I started to order my fish. \n\nThey were out of every fish but Tilapia. Oh well, I guess I'll have the Tilapia.\n\nThis time, the restaurant was busy, and just a tad more than a tad on the under-sophisticated side of the evolutionary scale.\n\nThe two ladies before us hemmed and hawed at what they wanted, and they wanted it 'this way', but no, 'this way', and with this side, but no, with THAT side, and on and on. The poor gal behind the register was getting a little frazzled, and that was compiled by the 'we don't have that right now' issue that they seemed to be having. \n\nIn the meantime, the guys in the back seemed unable to keep up with the orders, and didn't seem to be able to gain focus on what they were cooking, which seemed to be going a little wrong.\n\nSo my friend and I sat down to wait for our order, and while we waited, the under-sophisticated patrons began to get very verbal and somewhat obnoxious about their orders. 'This is NASTY - I want my money back!'  'This mac-n-cheese is dry and terrible!' Blah-blah-blah. Then there was a verbal altercation between two tables. \n\nOh boy, a floor show while we wait.\n\nWe waited a full half hour this time, and after they dealt with the ranting 'I want my money back' lady and the several trips to the table that insisted that they get the mac-n-cheese right or replace it, our order finally came together. I asked for a good load of tartar sauce which the gal put in the bag, and my co-worker and I were off to the office to eat.\n\nHer chicken was good. The mac-n-cheese WAS dry. The greens were a nice surprise until they were opened and eaten, and then they were a nice thought, but...\n\nSo I sat down and opened my $8 container of fried Tilapia.\n\nAnd one package of tartar sauce was enough to totally smother BOTH pieces.\n\nNow, I can't say for sure - but I do believe that somewhere a fishing company operated by extremely myopic fisherman was duped into believing that a school of baby minnows, on their way to a costume party, all dressed as Tilapia, were indeed a net full of adult Tilapia. I've had sardines that were bigger. \n\nTwo hours later I had to hit up another joint for some cheese fries just to feel like I'd actually had some food.\n\nMy advice for those who are hankering for some soul food who were thinking of  giving Frederick's a try, don't be totally turned away - but follow these simple tips instead.\n\n1) Do NOT go DURING the lunch 'rush'. They get frazzled and disorganized, and as a result, so do their patrons. Go BEFORE the rush, or an hour AFTER the rush. They really are very nice, and they do make good food - when they can actually focus on doing just that. \n\n2) The fried chicken really does seem to be what they do best. Unless they take a look at what other establishments downtown are offering as 'fish' and change their portioning and prices, it truly is not worth eight bucks for two fish mcnuggets. I've not tried their ribs (not really being a fan) so I can't speak for them. But the fried chicken, even during mayhem, came out alright.\n\nIf you're in the mood for good fried chicken, they beat the mystery meat of the colonel. Follow my two tips and you'll be fine.",1212,2
"We went to GR's P&G this afternoon for lunch and, I won't ask forgiveness for being blunt, this place was absolutely terrible and the only black mark on an otherwise perfect tour of Vegas' fantastic dining experiences. \n\nI must also say that we have very forgiving natures when it comes to restaurants, and that neither of us are food snobs; we simply like good food, whether it's from a proper gastro-pub or from a fine restaurant. This of course was neither. \n\nI ordered the little sliders (I forget already what they called them, having all day tried to repress the memories). I don't mind paying good money for good food or for good quantities. These sliders fit none of those descriptions. Each was as small as a silver dollar, greasier than anything from a proper pub, and to be quite honest flavourless save for the strong garlic butter the came with. A \""plate\"" of three of them cost 14 dollars. The \""chips\"" were greasier than a fast food place, were not crisp, and flavourless to match the sliders. These little greese-bars were nine dollars alone. \n\nMy charming companion tried the shepherd's pie. Being the verbally generous thing she is, she could only say that the dish wasn't terrible. A 22 dollar bowl of tripe is not what you'd expect from a fancy chef's establishment. Having tasted the pie myself, I could not be so forgiving in my description as her, nor could I really come up with something intelligent and so instead made, I think, an awkward face upon tasting it. \n\nThe one thing I will say was pleasant was the service. The hostess was very friendly, and the server was rather attentive and pleasant. This, combined with the fact we were terribly hungry when we arrived, was the only thing stopping us from walking out. \n\nAgain, I must point out that I am not snobbish when it comes to food. This place was terrible for cheap food, let alone for something this expensive. In our time at Vegas, I have eaten fantastic burgers at \""I Heart Burger\"", \""The Grand Lux Cafe\"", and KGB (Kerry's Gourmet Burgers\"" . . . Each of these phenomenal burgers were cheaper than my tiny little sliders and had flavors I cannot even describe. If you feel the need for a good burger, I would recommend any of those. \n\nI feel I must end this review on a positive remark . . . their little symbol of the Union Flag within an English Bulldog was cute.",539,0
"I'm not sure what made me think of this place today, but I miss eating there. Good food and the folks who own it are a real pleasure. It's not that Indian food in Philly is terrible - but it ain't great neither. Glad to see Taj is still doing.",62,3
"I stopped by this restaurant with a group of my friends who recommended this place.  The restaurant itself was dimly lit (very romantic) and classy looking.  We started off with a bottle of wine and the service was great!  The appetizers were decent.  The calamari was crisp and not too soggy or fried tasting.  Someone ordered the cut roll (California roll?) and it was okay.  I think this just wasn't the place for cut rolls.  But when dinner came, everything looked yummy.  The Butterfish seemed to be a big hit.  All their fish was moist and tender!  And you must save room for their molten lava cake!  I agree with everyone else...it's that good!! Definitely enough to share amongst 2 or 3 people.\n\nOverall this was a great place to have a fancier dinner with someone.  The service and ambiance was nice.  It is a little pricey, but you'd probably know that if you chose to eat at a place like this ;)",214,3
"Small businesses such as Espresso Royale give Champaign-Urbana its character. I visit the 6th and Daniel location often.\nThe undergrad library location, however, is the undergrad library location. It's full of tired and harried students and academic professionals, and most of us don't want to be there. The UGL is pretty old and you can tell.\nThis place is usually packed and you'll have to wait. In addition, I once applied for a job here. My friend of mine had worked there previously and told me the manager's name. When I asked for the manager, I could see her behind the counter. She told the employee that I'd asked to tell me that she wasn't around. I just gave them both a look of shock and walked away. \nI later spoke with the employee (a friend of the friend) and she said she felt horrible because she could tell I knew the real story. We all laughed about it over a few glasses of wine.\nNonetheless, here's the point: Espresso Royale deserves your money; the employees are kick-asses and Espresso provides quality coffee. They buy beans roasted locally (Columbia St.) and always, always, always have hot, fresh, dark roast coffee on hand. So, Espresso Royale gets my vote over Starbucks every single day. \nNote: parking around this location is not for the faint of heart.",291,1

My husband went yesterday and was so impressed by the service especially their fitting process!! He is running the marathon again this December and heard about this store and came home with a pair of shoes that he was pretty excited about!    Although I am not a runner anymore I needed a new pair of workout shoes and have been searching in the larger chain athletic stores for the past 2 weeks and have come home disappointed and empty-handed.  I wear a 10.5 in most of the women's shoes so selections are usually spare and I was hoping to find a shoe similar to my ASICs.  I was helped by Juliet. I gave her  my current shoes and after asking me a few questions she brought out 3 pairs of shoes for me to start off with.  All three pairs were better then the dozens I tried on in the chain stores!  I left with an awesome pair of Brooks that has me excited to work out in the morning.  They offer a 10% military discount as well.  We will be buying all of our running shoes from here on out!,224,4
"The issues with my vehicle have still not been addressed. David, the manager, has told me I needed new parts, ordered them, and then called me back to say they were not the correct parts and now the correct part will cost over $500 plus labor. (labor that he previously said would be covered due to the inconvenience)\nThe excessive waste of time, inability to address the issue, continued disappointment and steeply rising costs have brought me to the point where I will be contacting the BBB to report this Midas station, and contacting my bank to process a chargeback. For three days my car has been tinkered with and still it sounds worse than when I brought it in.",140,0
"It's so hard for me to figure out what stars to delve out to Hyde. \n\nHyde is probably the tiniest \""club\"" in Vegas. It really doesn't even look like a club, but more like a lounge. If the place is packed (which it usually is) there is no room to walk, no where to sit, no dedicated dance floor, and there really isn't anywhere to stand. Prepare to get pushed, shoved, bumped into, and accidentally hit. This shit show is at it's absolute best and worst when they do the XIV, a neon party (which is one Sunday a month and stars at 5 PM). No joke. You can't ask for a better party pit, but the only way to thoroughly enjoy this space is to have a table. MUST have a table. Seriously. MUST.\n\nWhen it's not the overly packed, the space feels a lot like an upscale lounge. Stunning views of the Bellagio fountains and the surrounding strip area. The music here various from Top 40 to EDM.\n\nCover and drink prices are on par with other strip club/lounge pricing. Look for a promoter on Twitter or Facebook.",251,1

"Third visit to the Indigo Yard. Well a few couple a months since the last. I never had a meal here (yet) but the ambiance is second to none! It is like being outdoors indoors. Dim lighting and a lot of wood. Stone floor with red brick walls. I feel like I am in a courtyard with a balcony overlooking the place below. If you can just imagine a Mediterranean restaurant on the beach. It is close to dusk. Low candlelight and stars overlook the place. You sit in one of the corner sofas. And a low funky beat is playing in the background. You order a beer which is served promptly and the waitress asks if you are comfortable. Oh yes! Very! \n\nThat is what it feels like. On top of that you have free wifi and delicious bar snacks. \nWhat I do find funny is that the bar is ever so slightly higher than you usual get. It makes you feel like a small child asking for sweets at a counter. However in this case I was asking for beer. Yes they have Asahi on draft! \n\nOne drawback though. The place is expensive. Oh yes! Very! That is the reason I don't visit so often. I would like to, but it does break the bank after 3 pints! The aforementioned Asahi is \u00a34.60\n\nI will come back - just to feel good. Would I stay a whole night?  No. 3 stars due to the prices.",311,2

"The location is nice, very moderate up scale look, during my stay at Monte Carlo i did not see any long line ever to go in.\n\nLike the star rating says this place was A-OK, the food was just ok. A lot of the variety of the food just did not mix well. The place looks big like with diffrent varietys of food, but in reality its the same food on one side on the other, on some spots they just pile a big section of just one type of food, for example a huge section for bread, lettuce and fries. The breakfast section was TOO small and not much variety. \n\nI liked the shrimp and fruit pile they had in the middle, so if you are a shrimp or fruit lover you would enjoy that. \n\nThe food did make me and my boyfriend have upset stomachs after, he liked the food a lot but did not like the after feeling of it. I thought the food was ok, not delicious or not gross. But i too had an upset tummy after. So i dont if it was just us or the place.\n\nIts not a horrible place, i recommend it for families, kids seemed to love that place and the price was not expensive at all compared to other buffets in Las Vegas.",268,2
"Returned this Friday, tried the pulled pork sandwich. It was an improvement over the Smoked Burger. While I enjoyed the flavors the sauce provided the meat was pretty dry. We also order the Brisket sandwich; it wasn't as good as last time too lean and a bit burnt.\n\nUnfortunately they had none of the Simple Malt beer left.\n\nThe coleslaw was not so sour this time but was considerably spicy. Lack of consistency.",94,1
"We made it to Brigs for a breakfast.  And I must say, I was a little bit dissapointed... So you might ask, Why 4 stars? Well I rounded up because of their service they provided.\n The food was good, but nothing that I believe I will ever crave.  \nThe presentation of the dishes was very nice however.  \nThe service was pretty good, we had a large group (19 if I am correct) and they filled the orders extremely quick and brought out all of the orders in a timely manner and at the same time, which is quite difficult to do. \nThe menu seemed large.  But, upon further inspection, it was just drawn out to make it look larger than it truly was. \nThe prices were reasonable, and I believe that I would choose Brigs over IHOP for the sheer fact that they most likely won't be as busy as IHOP.",194,3
"My girlfriend and I went here the other day. The breakfast place we usually eat at called OVEREASY has good food but AWFUL service, and it closes at 1pm. We like to wake up around 1pm, so this doesn't work for us. I found this place on the internet and it's close to my house, so we decided to go for it.\n\nTHIS PLACE RULES! They have FANTASTIC service! We were chatting with the waitress Stacy for quite a while, and she was so friendly and helpful. My girlfriend ate the biscuit and gravy, which was a meal in itself, and she loved it. I had the classic eggs, hash browns, sausage patties, and toast. My family is from England, and we love bangers and mash, so I am always skeptical about the sausage at breakfast places, but the sausage patties were very good. Kinda spicy. The toast was thick and delicious.\n\nGO HERE FOR BREAKFAST.",203,4
"This used to be my secret foodie spot for awhile, even before I started using yelp. I used to rock the happy hour here especially the late night that went from midnight to 4am. The service was always great, the chef always fun, and the drinks always flowing. \nRecently though, it's been different. After they killed off happy hour, the value factor wore off and the feeling wasnt the same. And around the same time the vibe really changed.  It's become less of a destination and more of a meh place. Ill definately give it more of a chance but I'm currently not impressed",129,1

I've started giving the waitress 3 beers, in order of preference, assuming that a couple of beers that are one the menu will not be available.  It's annoying and the service blows.  The food sub par bar crap and the atmosphere could not be more generic.  Unless you enjoy really crappy bars, avoid this place.",138,1

"This system is an above-average way to get a quick look at Phoenix for basically nothing (day passes are only $4 from ticket vending machines). If you're stuck on a long layover at Sky Harbor, take the Air Train to the light rail connection at 44th and Washington and head west, towards 19th/Montebello.\n\nHeading into Downtown, you'll pass by a few sites including the homes of the Diamondbacks (Chase Field) and Suns (US Airways Arena), see some everyday Phoenician businesses and avoid having to deal with parking. A few stops offer food options as well, within a short walk in most cases. End-to-end, the line is about an hour's trip.\n\nThere's art, some shade and even a few placards about the area's history at stations too (interested in reading about suburban development in the Phoenix area?

"To get it out of the way, the service is not that impressive. Ill prepared scheduling left one server and a trainee on the floor for a lunch shift. By one, there were seven or eight tables dining and our server was everywhere. He was nice and treated us well, but managing his tables and training took a toll on the level of service.\n\nThe food was decent. Not the best rodizio, but the AYCE basic meat came with 6 different proteins and the salad bar. With fifty different cold and hot items at the bar, you are bound to find something to eat. Unlike other places I have tried, the offerings are cheaper in quality and it showed. The fried bananas were just breaded bananas that were fried not the plantains I was hoping for. Pastas and bean dishes are offered to fill up diners. \n\nThe six meats that were offered consisted of bacon wrapped turkey, sausage, ham with pineapple, spicy chicken, BBQ chicken, pork, and sirloin. The latter were the best items. The beef was cooked to a nice medium rare and juicy. The pork was flavorful and possessed a nice spice rub. The pineapple was something my friend and I wished came around more frequently then once. The chicken didn't have much going for them. Not spicy or bold, so throwing chimichurri on them was the only way to spruce them up. The meats took a while to first come around, but once it started it was a blitzkrieg.",305,1
"AHHHHH!!! We are sitting at the restaurant right now waiting, waiting, WAITING, for the next course to arrive. This has potentially been the WORST customer service I have ever received at a restaurant, and as a result both my husband and I are playing on our phones to avoid eye contact with our server. \n\nWe had a 730 reservation, and upon trying to check in, the immature, unprofessional hostess told us we would still have to wait 20 minutes. Ok, no biggie -- hubby and I went to wander around the aging casino that is the MGM. We came back 25 minutes later, only to be told that we would still have to wait 20 minutes more. Seriously? We are paying $$$$$$$$$$$$$ (yes, that many dollar signs) for dinner and you can't even friggin seat us on time? We have been to multiple Michelin star places and we were quite frankly appalled. \n\nMy husband threw a little fit about this, and after a little scene out unprofessional hostess told us we could wait next door at the \""very exclusive\"" Joel Robuchon lounge. Oh goodie. A place to sit at an overpriced bar with no comped drinks because YOU ARE BAD AT HONORING RESERVATIONS!!!\n\nWe ordered drinks, and 5 seconds of receiving them the hostess came over to tell us our table was ready. Then she told us we had to close out at Joel Robuchon and that we could not bring our drinks over next door as it is a separate establishment. What is this, Cheesecake Factory? Actually, scrap that ... Even they let you bring drinks from the bar to the table. \n\nThen, we came over. The bitchy hostess also slammed every door on the way and showed her anger at her own ineptitude. \n\nFood was great. Not gonna lie. BUT THEN, my husband asked to speak to the manager .... And things went downhill.  Again. WAIT, isn't this a MICHELIN STARRED RESTAURANT?!?\n\nTurns out they don't currently have a manager. The sommelier came over. He defended the front staff, did not acknowledge that they were unprofessional, and then said, \""well, what do you want me to do?\""\n\nAnyway this place sucks.

Super healthy food and very clean restaurant! The bison burger was so good and I did not feel weighted down after eating it. Many veggie and vegan options as well as regular diet to choose from. I am not a fan of jicama but the seasoning on the jicama fries complements it well. I would go back to try to beverages they offer.,73,3
Well I decided to give this place another chance since I really do like the food. I ended up taking a friend thinking it would be a better experience but I was sooooo wrong. I don't know what is with the women that work there but they suck at customer service. I ended up having to ask the young man that works there to take our order after three other tables that had arrived way after we arrived had recieved their food before our order was even taken. He was great as usual but it still didn't  make up for the poor service we recieved that night. I will not be returning to that place ever again and I plan to speak to the owner if I can. So if you like bitchy women who neglect you and leave you starving & watching others eat then this is your place.,164,0
"Very nice noodle house.  Good service, quaint layout, and the price can't be beat.\n\nI'm struggling giving it another star because I noticed somethings in the 20 minutes I was there to make you go hmmmm.  You heard me 20 minutes to get in, order a shoyu ramen and asahi and get out.  Can't beat that for efficiency.\n\nMenu is straight and to the point, if you are not here for Ramen, go somewhere else.  Broths are Tonkatsu, Shoyu, and Miso.  Shoyu is the base for me (kinda like vanilla ice cream).  Soup comes standard with a few thin slices of roast pork, green onions, bamboo shoots, and some seaweed.  The noodles were decent but not homemade, very stock machine made ramen.  I like my ramen al dente, these were not.  I did add the pat of butter for $.50 which was a nice addition, but totally over priced.\n\nSat at the bar so had full view of kitchen and how things were prepared.  Didn't like how the cooks did not sanitize very well, bare hands on food doesn't bother me, but when you grab an egg and some  pork slices, I'd like to see you wash them hands before moving on to the next order.  Also noticed their Kim Chee was out of a bottle, which they could have done a better job at concealing if they kept it towards the back.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice spot to get your ramen on, I would totally suggest going here.  Keep your party to 4 or less otherwise it would be a stretch to find seating for everyone.",361,2
"I was extremely disappointed with the breakfast here as well as with their pastries. I had ordered the burger since I figured a Thomas Keller restaurant should not mess that up; I was very wrong. The brioche bun did not seem fresh, burger patty was dry and flavorless, and the so called \""animal sauce\"" was hardly in it. I highly doubt that they used Wagyu beef as the menu claims, even the meat at In-N-Out tastes better! I also didn't care for the chocolate almond croissant or the cheese danish, have had better elsewhere. My husband also didn't like his French toast, it lacked flavor and seemed too mushy.\n\nEven the service was lacking; the waitress never informed us of the specials and I only happened to glance at the chalk board in front of me after I placed my order. The food also took a long time to arrive. The coffee we were served was cold. All in all,  I would not recommend this place since it's all hype and no substance.",211,0
"Really liked the Secret Herb garden! Popped out here on a dreich day to check out what was on offer. No herbs bought this time but I plan on bringing family members with gardens here to pick out some unusual herbs.\n\nAs Emma has noted - cola, tangerine and hazelnut scents. It really is a pity that reviews don't come with added smellivision as it was amazing wandering round and sticking our noses in herbs. The strawberry mint would be perfect in a fruity mojito. It is that kind of place that makes you think about what fits where ingredient wise. \n\nThere is also a cute shop with coffee and cakes and various deli items. Not the cheapest for the deli items but some unusual, Scottish produced items so worth it for the availablity. I liked how you can sit in the cafe but also outside in the greenhouses on reclaimed furniture (yep, more reclaimed furniture but it fits here) with your coffee and cakes. There is GF cake available - usually at least two options but they were low when I was in. There's also seating for small people too as well as small people gardening accessories which are very cute.\n\nSo 4 stars from me till I sample the coffee and cake, but I'll definitely be back!",264,3

I got lucky with this visit, they burnt the bottom of my pizza and had to bring me another and didn't charge me for it so i couldn't complain about the high price for this little pie.  great for groups and having good conversation, but next time i will have my pizza delivered and enjoy the taste and forget the company.",130,2
"I'm probably going to lose any and all credibility for even reviewing this place and risk being excommunicated from Yelp by stepping foot in this establishment, but I have to admit it's not a bad place to go if you have kids. Sure, being surrounded by screaming kids, animatronic mouses, arcade games, a guy in a mouse costume, and pimply-faced teen employees serving you food may be someone's idea of hell. But, for those of us that have kids it can be a good option for a family night out.\n\nThere's no question the food is one-star-quality at best. The pizza is light on sauce and the crust has a weird buttery/oily texture to it. The toppings, however, seemed relatively fresh (we got a vegetarian pizza). They also get points for offering a salad bar (even though we didn't try it) and sandwiches. They never had this many option when I was growing up.\n\nThis location is surprisingly well-maintained. It's cleaner than I thought it would be for the amount of traffic they get. I saw several employees roaming the room, constantly picking up and clearing tables. I also like how they stamp families as they enter and check them when they leave -- making sure you're leaving with the right kid. You have to give credit to any kid establishment that takes precaution against child abductions.\n\nSo, my overall 3 star rating might seem a little high, but any place that can make my son laugh, sing, dance, and have a great time is ok in my book. They have some 'rides' that my 2 year old loved and plenty of games for older kids too. They even have skee ball, which I haven't played in years. (full disclosure: I was awesome at skee ball back in the day... almost thought about turning professional. I was that good).\n\nWhile this place isn't my idea of heaven, I can tolerate it just to see the smile on my son's face as the semi-operational animatronic Chuck E. belts out some tunes.",445,2
Looked up this place on Yelp for a PHO restaurant on a stormy rainy day. It's a small nondescript store in a small strip mall. The menu had a lot of items and we ordered the #1 Pho and the Bun Bo Hue. The Pho was kinda bland and the added meats were small. The Bun Bo Hue was a little better but not one of the better BBH that I have tried. All in all the meal was quick inexpensive 2 min from the ASU field and the service was good.,107,2

"The Stone Rose is a gorgeous open air venue within a stone's throw of the golf course at the Princess that could use a bit of updating. This place offers high end old school resort service as a consolation prize for tiny 80s-style restrooms and d\u00e9cor that occasionally lapses into the cheesiness.\nThe marketing director has hopped on the champagne bar bandwagon , and even Veuve is available at $20 a glass, but this does not an upscale venue make.  I'd much rather drink that glass downtown, though, and conversely I'm not sure that the Johnsons from Wisconsin appreciate the slick appeal of this marketing effort. Maybe this is why the deejay was playing such a confused mix of blast from the past and tired radio standards.\nCozying up outside by the fire is a rare treat in this area. We were here for the Big Party on Halloween, and I was happy for the warmth. Security here is almost overbearing, but I don't blame then when big groups of outsiders descend in costume.  They were more than helpful in directing traffic out front and ensuring that the event came off without a hitch.",241,2

"Yes, the outdoor dinning area is nice and romantic, and the live music is great.... but that is all about it. My husband and I each had a crepe (the one with the duck and the one with rabbit) and they were a little disappointing, Not only by the look, but also by the taste and the price! The batter they use is more like a cheap pre-made waffle batter mix. The portion is not that big. It came with a little slaw that was topped with cheap Kraft dressing. And really, 2 crepes for $41!! It is kind or overpriced considering the poor ingredients they are using. If you want to cut corners in your quality, you should maybe cut down the price too. We were thinking of having dessert, but the waitress didn't even refill our water once, so we went somewhere else.",174,1
Goregous hotel.\nThe people at the front desk are super-cool about helping you find your room after you've been lost in the hotel for an hour and are completely wasted from an all-night fernet drinking and fun binge....\nthey even offered to take me to my room in a wheelchair!

"I'm so confused.  There are two listings on Yelp for this place.  The only difference is the phone number. \n\nI don''t think this place is as horrible as others rate it to be.  It made my whole family really happy.\n\nWe all had the 15.99 Prime Rib and it was delicious.  \n\nIt comes with peas and mashed potatoe on the side as well, but you can request to not have them and just focus on the rib. \n\nI love my ribs medium rare and it came out so soft, tender, and juicy.  The following two to three we ordered came out horrible though.  It was dry and overcooked.  When we asked for an exchange, it still tasted bad.\n\nI guess a) they messed up at the end or b) they just give you the really good ones for your first dish and give you the older leftovers for the following.\n\nIts good value for money esp. if you're already at Circus Circus already.  \nOur waitress really could care less how many plates she bought out for us.\n\nThe poor people who work there must be numb at the end of the day.  The plate itself felt like a boulder! EEK!",274,3

"Kelly has brought me from all-over blonde highlights, to \""boom\"" red hair with a platinum chunk, to brown hair, and we have slowly made my hair more blonde and more blonde. My hair is still healthy and thick since this is a process that we have done over time. I have to say that I've never loved my hair color so much. I get a ton of compliments on my hair from friends to strangers in passing. \n\nKat has been cutting my hair for years and has helped it grow back to its full potential. Five years ago, I had went somewhere else and got my hair bleached blonde. The process was too fast and ruined my hair so I ended up having to cut it shoulder-length. Kat has done regular trims on it, not to take length, but to take off the dead ends and keep my hair healthy. Since the, my hair has grown more than halfway down my back. She has been consistently wonderful at styling my hair whenever I have an event to attend or just want that extra boost of confidence with a rocking hair style. She has also recommended me some Kerastase products that have been feeding my hair nutrients and keeping it voluminous.\n\nAll of the other stylists and staff are always more than welcoming and always strike up a conversation when they see someone who frequents the salon. I recommend all of my friends to Kelly for color and Kat for their cut and style. \n\nI have to say that this place keeps getting better and better.",310,4

"I looked up this restaurant hoping for a close approximation of Malaysian cuisine. The place is located in an active, mixed use area that is pedestrian friendly and a largely student/ hippy population. \nThe decor is trying to be Thai and the music was a horrible medley of obscure cover versions.\nI ordered the Achat, a refreshing pickled salad, served cold (a little too sweet for my taste), and the potato-chicken curry. The curry sauce and potatoes were excellent, although there was too much dark chicken meat and not enough potatoes.\nMy partner who is vegetarian got a vegetable soup in a dark, salty, soy\nbased broth that was bland but palatable. \nWe paid about 40$, which in my opinion was too much for an unremarkable meal I could have ordered at any old Thai restaurant. My quest for decent Malaysian in the mid-west continues...",182,1

"I'm very picky about people who care for those that I love. After just 1 visit, there is no hesitation in my mind that Canine Preferred deserves 5 stars! \n\nWe just moved to a neighborhood and needed a new place to keep our Buddy looking good, so I went to Yelp! Sara was very accommodating to our schedule and took great care of Buddy. Often times Buddy shakes when I pick him up, but he was calm and happy when I picked him up. Sara cut him just as I asked so he can enjoy our \""winter\"" here without being too hot. You could tell she took her time of his face which required a lot of patience (he turns his head when scissors come at his face).\n\nTheir prices are reasonable, but I think my favorite part is that after the dogs are groomed, they just walk around and hang out with the groomers or they go into a room that's perfect for dogs-no cages! I will definitely be taking Buddy back and recommending Canine Preferred.",211,4
"I tried this place last week. The food was good but the portion was a little small. The seating was kind of uncomfortably low and the tables were really small. My friend and I couldn't finish our food, so we asked for Togo boxes, at first he said we were not allowed to togo our dishes, then when we started to get upset, he went to the kitchen and gave us a couple of containers. After we packed our food, we got the bill and saw that they charged us for each togo box. This restaurant has absolutely ridiculous policies.",117,0
"Family night out with my wife, our two kids, and her parents and we thought we'd have a great night at Flo's. Unfortunately service was horrible and the food was ice cold when we received it. It took exceptionally long to receive our food and when we did we were so hungry we started eating. The waiter didn't return for a long while and when he did he took three of our dishes. They were not brought back for over 15 minutes, and even at that point only two were brought back. They brought a third one shortly after, but it wasn't what we had ordered, so this just added to the frustration. \n\nWhen the manager stopped by (I think she was actually the owner) she said they take the food right from the kitchen to the table and was somewhat argumentative which shocked me. She offered no resolution at all. I'm not the type to complain, and this is my first review of any type using yelp or any other online tool, but felt so compelled to do so after her attitude. \n\nI've been to Flo's many times and unfortunately this will be my last.",242,0

"Teharu Sushi is a neat change of pace from your standard sit down restaurant or standard sushi bar.  This place can get crowded so be prepared to wait a little bit depending on when you show up - simply add your name to the wait list if their isn't a hostess right at the door.  \n\nTeharu operates a conveyor belt where small plates full of sushi, sushi rolls, and other miscellaneous items (pudding cup anyone?) pass in front of you for your choosing.  With a conveyor belt you might be expecting top notch sushi but I would simply describe the fare as \""decent\"". The prices are quite good though as you can get your fill of Sushi for $10-20.  \n\nThe selection of rolls and sushi is alright - you will see a lot of the standards, nothing too exciting though.  Some of the rolls seem a little strange to me such as the ones with potato shavings, onion shavings, and the phillie roll with cream cheese and red meat...for American palates I guess.\n\nUltimately, you can probably find better sushi in the valley but you will also probably spend more money and won't get the fun conveyor belt experience.  \n\nCheck it out at least once for yourself.",265,2
"Augustus Cafe is like the homely, old high school friend that's always willing to hang out.  If you're staying at Caesars Palace, it's always open and even during slow times, the Cafe still gets moderate traffic.\n\nThe problem with ol' Augustus is that I have never had a great time with him.  He's comfortable, that much is true, because I know him well.  They serve pretty much your standard American fare with a few random outliers (most of which are Italian).\n\nAugustus is really no fun.  Be willing to wait in line here.  I had the Caesars VIP pass that let me cut in front of all the sad folks who have been standing in line for a good 45 minutes.  I truly did feel bad for these people but, hey, Augustus and I go way back.\n\nThe service here is fair at best.  It gets insanely busy in the restaurant.  I'm not looking to constantly hold hands with the server but throw me a bone here.  At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is that Augustus is there for you when you need him and he's surprisingly dapper in the morning.  I will say that the one thing that Augustus does well is breakfast.  If you can beat the breakfast rush, they have some pretty high-quality items going on.\n\nIf you've got another option, take it, otherwise prepare for a meal version of watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy.",333,1
"Love the location of this neighborhood taco shop. Their menu is huge, and there's lots of different things to try for me each time I visit. I ordered the rolled tacos and the carne asada burrito with guacamole. Being my first time here, I didn't know how much food that would be, but for $7 or so I couldn't resist. My girlfriend ordered the veggie burrito. \n\nThe rolled tacos were excellent, perfectly fried, not too greasy. The salsa bar had a good variety of green and red sauces with varying spice levels. My carne asada burrito was huge with lots of meat and beans. The guac was just ok. The veggie burrito was much better in my opinion--I'll have to order it next time. All in all, a nice place with something for everyone. Price was right and they even had happy hour in the afternoon with great specials on beer and food.",190,3

"Food was fair.  my husband loved his \""french\"" beef stew.  I dislike grilled asparagus for a reason, they taste burnt!  His mashed potatoes were very good.   My steak was  very big, juicy not too tough, but not really great.  I would not eat steak here again.   The server said their signature dish was \""cobb salad\"".    The coupon we had for dinner was  2 for 1 However, you had to buy drinks.   Two iced teas $5.20!   Also had soup which didn't come with dinner but only 1.99 each.   Very good broccoli cheddar and onion soup.    Total $26 after free dinner (12.99)   Not sure if I would go again unless I had a free breakfast.     The traffic is horrible here we had to go down to the next block and turn around.      I'm very picky but the service was fine, the server very nice.    The atmosphere was casual not too noisy.      The couple at the next table only ordered desserts.   They had bread pudding with a great big whip cream and some sort of open muffin or tart with whip cream.   It was over $10.    I wasn't able to eat the bread basket which was two rolls, two pieces of lemon poppy \""bread\"" and two pieces of something else.    Took that home with the leftover steak and stew.    For some reason or other the server did  not give me the potatoes that came with my meal, but asked me after it was served if I wanted it. .. Does that make sense?

"You can all believe Peter K. When he says to stay away from this business. My story is not as uncomoassionate as his, but it still shows their unprofessional practice. We went to Yuppie Puppie for a closer groomer.\nI had phoned a week earlier to inquire about having my daughters cat groomed. I told the appointment setter more than once that her cat had only been professional groomed once and he got aggressive with the groomer. Since that time, we have bathed and trimmed him at home. He needed a clean shave because he had two matted areas under his front legs. The girl on the phone assured me that he would be in good hands with Elana. Evidently, she was super with cats and could handle any cat. I also was told that he would be the first in the morning so as not to make him nervous with dogs barking.\nWe arrived at nine and some angry little women arrived at five after. She seemed a little pissed that we were waiting, there was another woman waiting with her poodle,also.\n So much for being first.\n So we get in after she pops open the door and wave us in with no words. I felt like I was at the DMV. Evidently they let five grown cats roam the salon all night. I don't have a problem with that, but any cat person knows that you will not make a new cat feel welcome if you have five other cats hissing at him and rubbing their glands on the outside if his carrier. \nWe had reservations to leave him but against our intuition, we did. Twenty minutes later, we get a phone call. It's Elana and she says,\"" umm, you have to come get him, he attacked me.\"" She had a ton of attitude and nonprofessional demeanor.

"This is one of those Casino's that magically popped up. Vegas is such a crowded strip that when casino's get built they are usually large, gaudy and everyone knows it's coming. Now granted I used to come to Vegas 10 times a year for years. I also took quite a bit of time from vacationing here and so by the time I got to stay here it's was established. Caesars has historically been known for shopping in Vegas, but the Miracle Mile of shops gives them a run for their money because of the variety and that all the shopping isn't just for women or fashionistas. I actually found some cool shops and not just a bunch of brand name designer shops predominantly patroned by women. \n\nOver the years my love for poker has died and I no longer play, except for ideal situations and Vegas isn't one of them. My love for craps has also waned, but my blackjack is in my blood and I still enjoy playing it, especially here. For me it's not the amount it's the vibe. Yea I usually stick to smaller amounts, but I don't mind the min amounts because I like the ambiance. The waitress' aren't any nicer, faster or better, but the feeling I get when playing here is something special and I make a point to play here when I'm in town. \n\nThe rooms are a little too themed for me. They are large and comfortable the 2 top priorities, but aside from sleeping and getting ready I spend very little time here. It could be cleaner, but it was acceptable. Since it's right on the strip and in the middle of it the room views are excellent. The hotel itself isn't towering so most rooms are pretty easy to get to and I can make quick trips outside  easily. I find the room pricing to be a bit much with few specials. I get flyers and e-mails from many of the other larger casino's frequently, but not here. I no longer drive to Vegas and this being in the middle they will try and gouge you to get here, unlike some of the southern casinos. \n\nGallery is a nice club to go to as a backup or if your able to go early to a better club and come here afterwards. It's the old Prive club revamped. I actually prefer coming here Thursdays versus weekends which can get packed, since the music is better than imo. Something I think all Vegas Clubs need to consider is the specialized music will draw more people than a new name or a new design. Will review separately as well.\n\nAs gimmicky as much of the hotel and decorations are if you stick to the table games areas you'll enjoy yourself. All slots areas are equally boring at all casino's, but leaving my room and going to the table games has an excellent view and vibe. \n\nSpice Market is the buffet. It's not the biggest, not the best, not the more varied, but what is does have is diversity. As the name suggests they do quite a bit of ethnic foods here like curry, cous cous, KBBQ, Kabobs on top of the usual's. Price is ok, cleanliness is good, service is excellent, but the variety reminds me a bit of a global food court. Crab legs pre split is a real plus, but they could be fresher. No lobster though. Will review separately as well.\n\nIt's not the biggest or the best or the nicest or the newest and I almost want to give them 4 stars.",744,2

"Dear Yelp Readers,\n\nThis small place in the bottom of the 19-story Allegheny Building on Forbes is a small cafeteria style restaurant with mostly home-cooked-like meals, complete with bright red trays.  No diner-like service would be complete without the fast talking always-in-a-hurry blunt order taker.  A friend and I ordered grilled chicken salads --- one of the healthier things on the menu. They were good enough to quench the mid-day hunger of your average office worker, but certainly pale in comparison to nearby places like Zorba's --- despite a similar price point.\n\nWe possibly made an error in ordering...... perhaps the reuben, grilled cheese with bacon, or the many \""melts\"" (surely served with mashed potatoes and gravy) would have been more popular, and more squarely in the wheel house of the cooks.\n\nThe girl keeping the tables and chairs clean was friendly and doing a good job.\n\nThe menu, the food, and experience was mostly forgettable, and I'm not sure we'll remember to go back.\n\nHyphenatedly yours....",240,2

I have never had a better IMAX experience outside of a true IMAX theater....until seeing 'MI - Ghost' earlier this year.  It was simply amazing.  The sound quality was absolutely amazing.  The screen seems to be 25% larger than normal screens.  The auditorium was very large!  The concessions are always good and fresh...and cost as much as your typical theater.  Challenges....depending on when you go....is parking......but that is how C-Mills is during most prime shopping hours.   The other challenge....and this happens in almost every \""non-Regal\"" theater I have gone to...and that is folks with their feet on the chairs.  Can you believe that folks come into a theater and actually immediately put their feet where people have to rest their heads.  One of these days.....the attendants will make an announcement before the show.......KEEP your feet down!!! Or get out!",228,2
Absolutely awful --  the atmosphere and the food.  We have never had such a terrible meal..  Don't know how they stay in business as a restaurant serving food like that.  We were there from 5:30 to 7pm and the only customers in the place.  I would hate to see the place with the lights on!!!  Even the service was only fair.  Don't waste your time or money!!!,92,0

"I had to stop a second and think: What is my major complaint with Doughboy's?. hmmmm. None. I love their pie. It's not a traditional fluffy crust type. It's a little heavier, but that matches their toppings. They have a 2 topping 12 incher that is 2 meals for me. It's 8 bucks, not too bad. The sausage is ground and they heap it on, m m m m yummy. They also have some great wings.\n\nEDIT: Well after sitting, waiting an hour and a half for my pie that I ordered via the website, I decided to call. It was great to get a bunch of attitude and hear how I didn't use the website correctly. I've only been ordering that way for months. Somehow it's my fault and did I check my bank account.? Really? The owner got on the phone and offered no help. He just kept saying \""What do you want me to do?\"" I want food! He should have offered to take care of the situation instead of beating around the bush. For the owners ignorance and the girl who answered the phones attitude towards a good customer, you get 1 star.\n You will never see another dollar of mine.",264,0
"I've had pizza from this place before and it was good but my recent experience was not.  I ordered a pizza for delivery and, after waiting over an hour gave them a call.  After a few phone calls and speaking to various employees they claimed the pizza was delivered to somebody at the pool at my complex.  There was nobody at the pool and even if somebody else had taken the pizza, we weren't offered anything in the way of compensation or even a rush on a new pizza.  Definitely will not be ordering from them again.",113,0
"My double cheese burger and Medium fries were trash worthy. The wrapper was hot so I thought the burger would be.... WRONG! The fries were warm but not fresh, you know how they get when they have set for awhile under the heat lamps. \n\nHowever much to my surprise my frozen mocha was very good.\n\nI called the toll free number and gave them feedback, first time I was ever moved to do that at a McDonalds! They are to mail me out a coupon to replace my burger and fries. I will not be cashing them in at this location that's for sure!",125,1

"AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi.",114,0

"This was my second time seeing the Chippendales but the first time seeing them in Las Vegas. They had come to my town and performed at a local bar and it was W-I-L-D.  Initially I thought that muscular men in thongs wasn't my thing but they proved me wrong.  So when I went to see them in Vegas, I was expecting an epic experience.  I was disappointed in the Vegas show and I blame my high expectation for that.   The show was great and well performed but the men at times weren't enthusiastic.  None of them were talented dancers but they sure were nice to look at.  Compared to my experience with them on tour, I found the Vegas show to be less interactive, very mild, and there was much, much less nudity.   Regardless, I'm sure you'll have a great time but if they ever come to you town GO SEE THEM.\n\nThe Flirt Lounge was a little awkward and the staff was actually rather unfriendly.  After the show you can get a free poster if you buy a drink and most of the Chippendales come out and socialize.  You can tell they're forced to do this as most just crowded around the entrance and leave after ten minutes \n\nThe Chippendales show is very disability friendly.  The bathrooms are spacious and disability seating is available.  However, as with most disability seating, the view sucks.  We were out on the furthest wing and the show just isn't that great at such an angle.  My mother was also very disappointed.  She felt very ignored and thought that they were afraid of her wheelchair.  I had noticed that she received less attention despite having purchased VIP seats and being in the first row (my mother LOVED the Chippendales until the Vegas show).\n\nIf you go to Vegas with a group of women it's almost mandatory to see the Chippendales or Thunder From Down Under.  You will be titillated and entertained but the show lacks talented dancing and interaction with the audience.",433,2
"\""There's plenty of idiots that work here.\""...those were the words of one of them in the flesh. This fellow proceeded to tell me that he couldn't put a new battery in my VW JETTA because the battery was buried under an electrical panel. He said it would take over an hour, even though a different gentleman the night before at the same location told me over the phone they could do it no problem. I called the VW dealership and their service rep literally laughed when I told him what the employee at Auto Zone had told me. So I proceeded to confidently show my \""not so complicated battery\"" situation to Alex who didn't even respond with so much as an apology. In fact, he passed me on to another employee! And thank God! I got much needed assistance from Carlos, who appeared to be an assistant manager. He provided quick and helpful service regardless of Alexander's unwillingness to help me from what I suspect was an acute case of stupidity and laziness. Never going back to this location ever again. \n\nPS this location is in an awful part of town.",225,0

"Perfect hole in the wall Mexican food restaurant! Quint,authentic, family owned, just the perfect atmosphere.Great Margaritas! which is always what breaks or makes a Mexican restaurant for me. My friends and I split some awesome oysters which i was apprehensive about at first, just because this place really is the definition of 'hole in the wall,' but they turned out to be great... then again it was my first experience eating oysters... We all ordered burritos which were also very good, I love a place that isn't afraid to use dark meat chicken. I mean why do restaurants always advertise white meat chicken anyways?  that's what usually steers me away from ever ordering chicken in the first place! For sure gotta come back to try more of their menu!",156,4

Update: This place is under NEW management now. I took my vehicle back in after dicovering that they had failed to tighten the lock nut on one of the tie rod ends which is what caused the alignment to go out and ruin the tires. They fixed the alignment and put two new tires on at no charge. However it took them 3 days to do this and they tried to find a way to make it my fault. They fixed it but still lost my business.,96,2
"Green Valley Resort and Casino really isn't that old. It is one of the newer Station Casinos. But it does feel a bit run down inside though. I have never seen any part of this place except the casino, so this is just about that. Each time I have been there there isn't that vibrance and energy that is nice in a casino. \n\nThe dealers and staff here are no nonsense. They know what they are doing and have been around the block. There are always $5 tables if you like to gamble small. My drink order did get messed up here twice though and I kind of prefer when dealers are a bit more sociable and actually talk to players and engage in the game instead of making it seem like a boring job. A smile makes losing money so much better.\n\nThis is a good locals place and is good if you want low limits for table play, but don't expect fancy. Green Valley is pretty low frills.",201,2

"A weeks ago, my flight into Vegas was delayed for over 3 hours. By the time I got to the Wynn, the room type that I had booked was sold out. Erin from the front desk sent me over to a nice room at the Encore, a connected and adjacent property. It was a great little suite. The linens and the furniture were all top notch. All of my colleagues who had gotten rooms at the Wynn were impressed with the room at the Encore. Thanks Erin.\n\nThe overall level of service was high. The staff, from the front desk receptionist, to the servers, to the bartenders (Heather at the Parasol Bar), were all friendly and helpful. I was just killing some time playing low stakes roulette and ordered a White Russian.

This was my first visit to this restaurant and I may not be back. It took the waiter about 4-5 minutes just to greet our table. We ordered an appetizer and he didn't come back right away to take our actual order. We ordered the quattro al forno which was supposed to have 4 different types of pasta and one of them was missing. The waiter didn't once ask how our meal was or if we needed anything. I will also add that it wasn't all that busy in here as it Easter Sunday. Our friends ordered baked rigatoni and the pasta was undercooked. I wouldn't recommend this place. I was a waitress and I think I give people a fair chance when I go out to eat. Oh and we got a different waiter at the end and our first one never came back to the table. Gotta love shift change!,179,2
"Went here for NYE 2012. This was the most un-organized and disappointing event I have ever been to. Was with a bunch of good friends so our night wasn't ruined thank god. Only 1 open bar with 3 bartenders to service the entire club. No hors d'oeuvres nor a champagne toast as advertised. Couldn't pick up will call tickets until right before the event opened, so two ridiculous lines. I will be ringing my credit card company to reverse the charge, this was a complete scam.",113,0
"Terrible food. Long waits. Overpriced. Don't believe the other reviews! Avoid this dump and you'll save money and eat better.\n\nFries were soggy and cold, totally falling apart when I tried to eat them with my hands and then turned into mush when I gave in and used a fork. The burger was completely lackluster - it was literally the worst burger I've had. Every fast-food place I can think of makes a better burger. The fake cheese completely enveloped the tiny burgers, the bun was paper-thin and flavourless, and their \""all-dressed\"" toppings were practically non-existent. I was literally given a single three inch strip of onion, to put this into perspective. The orange drink was okay, not anything special, and definitely not worth the price they charge. \n\nI went at lunch so there was a bit of a line, but that doesn't explain why I  stood there waiting 10 minutes before ordering. They charged me $1 extra for the bacon on my burger, which is fine but follows an inconsistent logic: their cheeseburger comes with bacon, the double does not. When I got back to my office to eat it, I discovered they had forgotten to put the bacon on the burger at all. \n\nThe whole meal cost $13.30, which is about double what it would cost for better quality frozen food from any of the other dozen fast-food burger places around.",305,0

With tip, $100 for dinner at a Mexican joint.  Food was good, service was good (although they could use a hostess stand in front as no one greets you when you walk in), and decor was nice.

"I wish I could rate saint-sulpice higher. it's a huge establishment--like three or four floors.\n\nI came on a night they were having a free improv show (en francais, mesdames et messieurs!), which was definitely a fun time. the parts I understood were hilarious...the parts I didn't understand were funny too (choice body language!).\n\nunfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with two things:\n1) I walked in looking for my friends who said they were at the improv show. I didn't know it was all the way on the top floor, so I wandered around on the first floor for a while, searching. eventually a guy came up to me and asked \""tu cherches quelque chose?\"" (\""you're looking for something?\"") to which I tried to explain the situation in french. my french isn't horrid, but you can definitely tell I am not a native speaker. he cut me off mid-explanation and said \""I CAN SPEAK ENGLISH TOO, YOU KNOW\"" in a really offended voice. I'm sorry I tried to reply in the language with which you started the conversation. jesus. calm your balls, I'm sure your english is fine. don't need to get all angry and defensive.\n2) upstairs was crowded due to the improv show. I didn't see any coatracks (maybe my eyes were failing me) but just hooks or something for jackets would be nice...it was pretty stuffy and hot in there, given the crowdedness.",323,2
I recently went to Fuego to use my Groupon and enjoy some good eats.  This place is a little hidden but the menu is awesome.  When we got there we had to wait for the wait staff to find a table.  For a Thursday night the place didn't seem busy but the wait staff couldn't handle the crowd.  After several minutes getting soaked by the misters we finally got a table.  Several minutes later we received our waters and several minutes after that we finally got our Sangria.  The host/waiter seemed very flustered even though the place did not seem too busy.  For my meal I decided on the Organic Spinach Salad.  The salad was perfect for such a warm night.  The bacon citrus vinaigrette dressing and goat cheese were a perfect combination!!  \n\nI have heard so many wonderful things about Fuego but my experience was not the best.  The host/waiter kept apologizing which didn't help the situation.  The food was amazing and I will probably go back to give this local place another shot.,220,2
"I'm a picky dessert eater and I had high hopes for this place. The guy working there didn't come across as passionate for chocolate. The store is full of strange nic-naks like cards and accessories. The chocolates I ordered were delicious but they were presented to me on a teeny-tiny napkin... not even a nice napkin. I was offered a drink with it and when he mentioned \""hot chocolate\"" I asked how it was made since I used to barista at a coffee shop. I can't recall exactly what he told me but it wasn't appetizing. I think it was just hot water and a packet... awkward. I would suggest steaming some milk and using a homemade sugar, cocoa combination... something a little more authentic feeling. The interior needs a facelift I think. It just wasn't appealing to me as a woman. I may come back for a little treat but its not for certain.",190,1
"I really wanted to like this place. It's a great location and very convenient for me. The interior looks fresh and inviting and has a good vibe. The staff were friendly and quick, the menu looked simple but appetizing. Great, may have found my new local...\n\nThen the food arrived. And this is where the stars just keep on dropping. I think our food was cooked by a college kid in a dorm room. We ordered the Cubano Panini and Napa pizza (gluten free crust). The panini was bland and uninspiring, all I could taste was mustard. I went to see Chef a few weeks ago, came home and made Cubanos for the FIRST time and they were 10 times better than these. The pizza was just terrible, I think I just got a kid's pizza lunchable. No real flavour or anything special to it at all, so disappointing. Honestly, this food would be about right if it were in the under $5 category, but nothing more.\nI really wanted this food to be good, what a shame.\n\nWhy is it that places like Market Bistro (who made amazing Cuban Pork sandwiches and pizzas) cannot stay open but places like this arise?

"Came in on a Wednesday night and sat inside, part eatery and Sports bar. I liked how each booth had a flat screen but there were flat screens and sofas if you just wanted to relax as if you're at home!\n\nI opted for a booth but had great views of the entire place for decent people watching. I started off with a cold green tea which was flavorless. My waitress who was there physically but mentally absent took my order for BBQ wings , onion rings and the  B.U.B burger. I specifically requested the wings first and others to follow later but within minutes after the wings arrived the other two items appeared. When the waitress returned and I advised her what happened and her reply was the kitchen was caught up!  The food was decent but I was pleased mostly with the wings. The onion rings were too large, under cooked and a few had too much batter. The burger which contained two large slices of beef, bacon bits and contained another slice of bread which I removed. The burger was overcooked and on the dry side. I was ready to order peanut butter ice cream but the absent minded waitress didn't even bother asking if I wanted dessert and just left me my tab. It's ashame an establishment put this much time and money into this business and yet they have such a sad and unmotivated employee interacting directly with clients. I made sure I tipped accordingly which I thought was still generous.\n\nCompared to my first experience outside at the Umami Beer Garden, this was a horrible experience.

"My experience was one of the worst for dentist's in general. \n\nThe main concerns - \n\nDr. Xa was fine, but he suggested I get a deep cleaning and I was told by 2 other dentists that it was not necessary. I know opnions very from dentist to dentist, but my teeth were not in bad shape at all. I take very good care of them. \n\nThe lady that numbed my mouth and that preformed the deep cleaning - horrible. \nWhen she was numbing my mouth, it was excruciating. I've had my mouth numbed and I would like to think I have a very high pain tolerance and I have no issues with needles. But good god, I swear she was just rough. Throughout the entire cleaning, she was so rough, I flinched a few times and she seemed to not care or even ask if I was okay. Just keep on digging! \n\nMy last complaint - My entire mouth was numb. She didn't ask me if I wanted to see a mirror nor did she clean the paste that was all around my mouth. Seriously? I have been in for numerous cleanings and they always clean your mouth off or ask if you want to see a mirror to clean it off. I had just assumed when she dabbed my mouth a couple of times that she must have not gotten much on my face. Nope. I walk out after paying, get in my car and there was dried paste all over my mouth. All of the ladies up front would have seen it too, and not one of them thought \""Hmmm, maybe we should tell her that her mouth is covered with paste and maybe she'd like to wipe it off?\"". \n\nI'm sorry, it's just very poor customer service there and it's not welcoming.

Now I admit it was my mistake to drop off the items without insisting on a pre-job quote (I asked how much it would cost but he told me he can't know until he does the work) I was furious!! this is ridiculously over-priced! I talked him down to 40 bucks in increments of 5 dollars... then I just gave him the money and walked out of there.... wah wah wahhhh.... hmmm still debating whether I'd ever go back there again.",303,1
"Horrible. This place has not changed since I worked there 24 years ago. Granted, I was the worst busser in the world, but that does not excuse the bad food, old decor, tired menu, and lackluster staff. \n\nThe food is essentially taco bell but more expensive. The guacamole is neon green without flavor, the food swims in grease, and the beans and rice are often cold by the time they get to the table.\n\nThere are better restaurants just a few minutes away.",108,0

"If i have my way I'm never going to stay on the strip again.\n\nWe got a suite in rush tower. The room was beautiful and the price was so reasonable. The bed was amazingly comfortable too. It took me a minute to find the blowdryer so i was panicking thinking about walking around with wet hair but i found it in the closet, so my only tip would be to make it easier to find. ;) The pool was fantastic, the shark tank is amazing and the water slide is so fun. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants but we got dessert from the chocolate box and the cupcakes were really good. All the staff we met were really nice and we didn't lose in the casino! \n\nI'll be back!",162,4
"Neither my boyfriend or I have ever used SS, but since our flight was so early in the morning, we didn't want to ask anyone for a ride, so I scheduled a SS.  GOOD IDEA?\n\nOur flight was scheduled for 7:20 or something around that.  The earliest time they pick up is 5am, which seemed ok at the time of scheduling.  They of course fail to mention that after picking us up, we'd also be picking up two more slack-ass parties who's flights aren't till 9am and won't be in any hurry to get in the van. \n\nSo, they showed up on time, that was a plus, but I'd say everything pretty much went downhill from there.  We went to the next stop in the mega-apartment center near the Chandler Mall which isn't too far from our house.  Couldn't find the guy who was being picked up so drove around for about 10 minutes, finally found him and still had to wait for him to get his shit together.\n\nThen we went to pick up the most annoying family on the planet.  We get to their gated community down the street from the last pick-up and they don't know the code, so they have to drive from their house to meet us at the gate to swipe their wand thingy, ok. whatever. then we follow them to their house where they are still packing.  After ten more minutes everyone is in the van and we are off.  We get on the freeway and are on our way to the airport...untill, the man of the annoying family we just picked up announces he's forgotten his \""heart medication\"" (after thinking about this for a while, we think he made that shit up and actually forgot his socks or some bullshit).  Soooo, we TURNAROUND to go back to his gated community where they don't know the code to get in, so they send their innocent (but portly) 13 year-old daughter over the fence to run back to the house. At that point the driver shoulda been like, \""dude, we'll call you another shuttle to pick you up, I gatta get these people to the airport so they don't miss their flight\"" but no, we waited what seems like half an hour for this girl to run to and from their house and back over the fence to actually take off for the airport again. We are off again and the family is chuckling about what an idiot dad is and of couse we are fuming, but don't want to get into a fight, just want to get to the god damned airport on-time.\n\nSo yeah, we get to the airport at 6:55 for our 7:20 flight.  Barely, BARELY make it, and wanted to kill someone. BAD BAD BAD idea.",613,0

"first off the line to get in here was redic.  LIKE ABSOLUTELY REDIC. full of like very overweight people, old people, families, whatever. (sorry is that too much??) \n\nour server was SO NICE and he was the happiest guy!  we really liked him! \n\nthe problem was in the kitchen.  my friend ordered an omelet with no cheese, and i ordered a portobello mushroom sandwich.  (easily veganizable, which i liked!) \nfirst off - the mushroom sandwich came out like 10 mins before the omelet which is always a peeve.  come on send stuff out together, even taco bell sends out a complete order - piecemeal makes everything uncomfortable. \nTHEN my friend finally gets the omelet - and its full of cheese.  she has to send it back as she is lactose intolerant.  about 15 mins later (note: i have completely finished MY sandwich at this point) she gets a new omelet - IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT.  LIKE A HUGE BLACK HAIR.  we were DYING.  but she was also starving.  she sent the omelet back.  third time was a charm and it came out with no cheese, no hair, and looked ok (*fingers crossed LOL)  but we were surprised that after sending it back twice and waiting over an hour to get her omelet that it wasn't comped.  \n\nVegas should be about customer service, its a vacation!  why do these restaurants forget the main rule - its about service.  \n\ni will never go back there. \n\nVegan pro tip: they have soy milk available for coffee.",355,0

"I wish there was a half star more I could give Tottie because it is really my favorite place for Chinese or Thai (haven't tried the sushi) but there have been one or two slip ups on the part of the staff. Aside from that, Tottie, I love you long time!\n\nGood, dark and elegant place for a date, or affair, Tottie, and you could make a great meal from just the appetizers. Order a Pu Pu. Huh-huh! \n\nThe Tottie Rolls, with sauce and lettuce wrap are great and if you're lucky and it's late, Tottie will prepare them for you and feed them to you while her womanly chest heaves with desire, using food as one would join in human sexual desire. But I digress.\n\nAll the dishes are terrific but I wish the Pad Thai was not as mushy. If you do have any complaints, Tottie is always the lady and restaurateur and will treat your complaint with patience and kindness or perhaps a spanking and some rough stuff before she forces your head into the plate of Pad Thai by lying prone on your back, squirting that Scrimshaw sauce, or whatever they call it, into your nasal cavity and belittling you in Chinese because you've been a naughty, naughty boy. But I digress\n\nFor dessert, I highly recommend the coconut ice cream with fried honey bananas. Your banana will be surprisingly hot and Tottie likes it that way. That's how she serves the bananas in her place.\n\nI didn't care for the incredible wait at the Paradise Valley location, but hopefully Tottie will have more openings for us all. But I digress.",357,3

Way better than I expected.\n\nWe started the night with appetizers and wine in the restaurant part of the bar.  Our waitress was extremely friendly, polite, and knew what to recommend based on our tastes.  She even recommended the wines for us perfectly.\n\nAs we sat there talking, one of my friends had a question.  He waved down someone he thought was working there, and we come to find out that the person we waved down was the GM of the store.  It was nice to see the GM working just as hard as his employees.  We ended up having a nice conversation about the types of cigars, and he even helped make recommendations on what we should get for cigars.\n\nOverall, our experience at the store was amazing.  The employees were helpful, the GM was amazing, and the food and cigars were perfect.",203,4

"Wife and I met friends for food and drink before the DBacks game.  Although it is 4 blocks from Chase Field, the walk isn't bad.  The good news is the food.  I had the wings (honey hot, long on honey, short on hot) while the wife had a small pizza.  Our friends followed suit.  \nI think we all agreed the food was good for the price (we ordered off the happy hour menu), especially considering the location.  The beer selection was exceptional.  Between the four of us, using fingers and toes, we could not count the taps.\nThere was a two piece band playing.  One guy on guitar and vocals, the other played sax and, incredibly, the accordion.  But hey, the were good and I enjoyed their performance even though it did make conversation more difficult.\nSo much for the good news.

"Sometimes a place, an event, a meeting of soul and spirit happens that is to be one of those life events in a place that will change you forever. I was invited to attend a High Tea at the Tea Court at the Arizona Biltmore, which I had no way of knowing was to be one of those life changing events.\n\nOh, I've been to High Tea before, but never one that provided an experience that was so intense, yet so relaxing that the world passed us by and we were totally unaware of more than the Tea Sommelier and his depth of knowledge of the Teas, the Delectables and the Pastries we were served.\n\nThe Tea Court sits just across from the main lobby in the Arizona Biltmore. It is in its own alcove with an invisible veil that you feel immediately upon entering the space. The hustle & bustle of weddings, tourists, hotel guests and staff are so close, yet the veil is somehow protecting the Tea Court from the constant activity. The peace of the Tea Sommelier's words and the calm heart you feel knowing you are where you were meant to be at this very moment in your life.\n\nThe Tea Sommelier, Kevin Michael Doyle, was where he was born to be. He has found his rightful place in this world and he knows it. He feels it and anyone who listens to his words knows that he is an expert and that he truly loves this very moment in time.\n\nWe experienced Black Currant Tea, African Solstice herbal infusion, Ginger and Pear White Tea. The Delectables included Smoked Salmon, Creme Fraiche, Cucumber, Sweet Red Onion, and Capers on Pumpernickel; Dill and Shrimp Salad Cherry Tomatoes; Lobster Basil Salad in Profiterole Crisp and many more . . . plus the Pastry selections included a Schnepf Farms Peach Mousse Swan, a handmade Turtle Truffle, White & Dark chocolate swirl strawberries, and many more . . . the elegance of the Tea Court touched that spirit that lies hidden within us all.\n\nI can think of no place I would have rather spent an entrancing Saturday afternoon that with a small alumni group and Dean Gangone than at the Biltmore Tea Court with Kevin Michael Doyle. \n\nThe Tea Court at the Biltmore - One item on my bucket list checked off that I didn't even know was there.",492,4

"All the hype lives up to expectations.\n\nCame in for lunch before leaving Las Vegas. Caught a good day with no line. Staff was helpful, friendly and prompt. Total rewards members (casino card program) entry is discounted. This buffet priced a little more than others but worth the difference. The discount helps it too.\n\nPan holders are provided and we are seated. Drink orders are taken in a timely fashion as we get straight to the stations. Lots of variety. Definitely one of the biggest around. There are clearly defined areas. Seafood, meat, Italian, Latin, Asian, dessert are some. There are dishes that are oven hot and have the pan holders if you left yours at the table. Fresh plates are used each round up. \n\nFor lunch there is not a limited selection of seafood. From salmon to halibut. Shrimp several ways. Ceviche, cocktail, et. Oysters, mussels, crab legs, crawfish are some offerings. Warm and cold are the variable plates. Properly maintained were the cold items such as the oysters. (I've gotten sick at other casino buffets)\n\nMeats. So many selections just at the carving station. Brisket, turkey ham, prime rib, mango chicken sausage, hot links, kielbasa were just a few I tried. The meats were seasoned masterfully. Meats melted and tender. The hot links were spicy mouth was burning. Oh so good though. Other items found at this station include fried chicken, roasted chicken, chicken and waffles, fries, potatoes, any practically anything for classic buffet faire. Most of the options were good. Some a little dry but nothing where enjoyment was lost.\n\nThe next station had some Latin faire. Chili Colorado, fajitas, enchiladas, rice, tamales and likes. These were some of the better Spanish and Latin I have tried at a buffet. Most times dishes are dry and lacking seasoning. These were moist, fresh, and wanting more.\n\nA salad bar, soups, rolls, and various small plates. Some good tried included the truffle soup, gratin potatoes, and truffle macaroni n cheese. Each of these were good enough to return for a second helping. Moist and seasoned to perfection both helpings. \n\nItalian and pasta station I didn't get much into. Classic fair of sauces, pizza et. They looked pretty good. \n\nAsian faire station has been by a mile the best for a buffet I have tried. Japanese, Korean, and Chinese faire. \n\nThere was a choice of three sushi rolls. Each distinctive. I enjoyed the spicy tuna roll. Fresh was the rice roll and the tuna. A good spicy was found. A ramen, pho, and udon station was available. I tried the ramen. Freshly made noodles are boiled to order in a light stock with the noodles, barbecue pork, and vegetables added (can be with held on request). The ingredients are pulled once cooked and added to a simple miso soup brith. The broth was seasoned and demonstrated respect found in preparation at a Japanese ramen house. \n\nFor Korean and Chinese dishes, I tried the golgibi beef, various dim sum (shu Mai, dumplings), and duck were some of the items enjoyed. Tender easy to eat beef was the golgibi. Dim sum items were flavored, sized and appropriate like found in many Chinese brunch times. Duck was fair amount of meat to fat. The Chinese and Korean offerings were better than most actual restaurant fair without the outrageous pricing. \n\nDessert and snack bar. Fruit, cookies, pies, pastries, donuts, gelato, chocolate/caramel apple and pears. My eyes at this point are bigger than my belly. Everything is so scrumptious. There is more than something for everybody here.\n\nGood: variety for everyone, flavors hit most marks, proteins were appropriate temperature and seasoned, organized, friendly. \nBad: didn't find lobster during lunch but otherwise everything was good and so full (from eating- not bad). \n\nI'd be back to eat more. Definitely one of the best buffets to date.",860,3
"I decided to get a burger while waiting for my connecting flight at the Phoenix airport as I was pretty hungry. A quick walk around the terminal led to Deluxburger which had a menu focused on burgers so decided to give it a try.\n\nI got the classic burger($11.50) and chocolate shake ($6.50). Like every other restaurant at the airport prices were almost double of what you would pay outside. After ordering it was almost a 15 minutes wait to finally get the food.\n\nThe burger itself was pretty big but not huge, with a lot of stuff thrown in between the buns. I could comfortably lift it and bit into it without making a big mess. There were two problems with the burger. First the patties were overcooked so were dry as a bone. Secondly the burger was over-seasoned. It had so much salt that I could not taste anything else on the bun, just the taste of salt in every bit. After a couple of bites I could not bear this torture anymore so I gave up and trashed it. The chocolate shake on the other hand was very pleasant. It was not too sweet yet sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. I would have personally liked the milkshake to be a lot thicker but this was easier to put down.\n\nOverall not very impressed and will look at other options the next time I need to get something to eat at Phoenix airport.",295,1
"If you need a cheaper option to stay in Las Vegas, this is a good place to go.  While it's nothing to write home about, it still provides basic amenities and a basic continental breakfast.  The only thing I do NOT recommend is ordering their room service food.  The room service food is actually ran outside of the hotel, and is delivered through a different food company.  They were very late and also forgot half of our order.",93,2

"We strolled in on Sunday around 5:00pm and did wait in what I felt like was a shockingly long check-in line for the day/time. We spent about 15/20 minutes waiting to get into our room. We hit the lottery however and were given a 56th floor suite upgrade from the amazing lady at the front desk. If your not so lucky and want a great view south of The Strip (MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay) head to the 55th floor and they have some huge panoramic glass to get a breathtaking view. Here is a tip... the 56th floor just has a big wall so you won't be seeing anything. \n\nThe suites provide some small kitchens but needing ice will provide you quite the adventure! According to the lady at the front desk they only have ice machines on the 5th and 50th floor which seems a tad sparse considering the large hotel. \n\nThe pH Westgate does lack a casino which keeps the late night volume down and the Miracle Mile Shops does have an ABC Store close to your hotel entrance to get cheap liquor, snacks, and even healthy things like fruit for your room. \n\nYou are connected through the Miracle Mile Shops to the pH casino and tons of great dining and budget dining in the immediate area (Earl of Sandwich - My Review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas#hrid:K5mBPENNb-gjr9-lExmz6A). The Miracle Mile Shops has a new quick access walkway into CityCenter adding to the convenience of the area. \n\nOur room had better television choices than almost any other Vegas hotel we have stayed in. So note to yourself if your not in Vegas for gambling and want something on TV (I recommend here possibly over some casinos). \n\nThe lightning in the hotel is spot on and our living room area has more than enough space to please you. We had a small dining room table that never got touched. A great comfy couch and nice chair to enjoy our amazing view. A bed high off the ground with some convenient reading lights and unique leather headboards. \n\nThe people talking about the \""long walk\"" through Miracle Mile can get over it. The walk is not this bad to get out of the casino and it's a super convenient location all around compared to other hotels. if you don't like walking or are not interested in doing so then you should drink more or not come to Vegas. Walking around The Strip is more than half the fun of this place.",552,3
"I live in Denver and have a home in Suprise, AZ that I hired Northpoint to manage for me.  At first, my contact there was great but she left and they transferred me to a man (Shaun R) who I was not happy with.  \n\nMy renter moved out June 30th and has been vacant ever since.  They claimed that they listed the house on a number of rental websites but I could not find it on any of them when I looked.  In addition, I thought maybe our house was priced too high (thus why it did not rent for 3 full months).  When I asked Shaun about the websites he told me Northpoint has an autogenerator that reposts the ads every few days but I still couldn't find them.  He ignored my question about rental prices all together.  After 3 months of feeling ignored (and having my house vacant) and two consecutive weeks of no email responses from Shaun, I called the office and complained to the manager.  I was assured that they would look into it and either the manager or the company VP would return my call.  Needless to say, neither one did.  Approximately two weeks later I got an email from Shaun saying that Northpoint was no longer going to service my area where should they send the keys.  So, three months of lost income, exceedingly crappy service from my contact and the manager of the Phoenix office, and then dropped.  After getting a new property manager, I've since learned that the carpet was not cleaned when the tenant moved out (there were food and other gross stains on it), the tenant left a non-working fridge in the garage that I had to pay to have removed and there had been homeless people living in the backyard since shortly after the house was vacated.  Very, very unimpressive.  I also have other rental properties and have never had service this bad.",393,0
"WARNING:  Don't order the veal.\n\nMy brother heard about Gilbert Pizza from a co-worker, who happens to live in the area.  The guy gave it high praises and said it was the best Italian food he has eaten in Arizona, so we decided to check it out.  There were three of us, my brother, his wife, and myself, and we all had different entrees.  The chicken Marsala, chicken Parmigiana, and the veal Parmigiana   I thought it was nice that they bring a dish of garlic knots to the table to start you off.  My brother and his wife were happy with the chicken dishes.  They thought the sauce was decent, the sides of pasta was done well, and the portions of chicken was ample.\n\nI figured I would try the veal since most Italian places don't offer it and I haven't had any veal in years.  I did ask the waitress before ordering if it was real veal and not a veal patty.  She said it wasn't a patty, which it wasn't.  What she failed to say was that it was a sheet of paper.  If it was any thinner,  it would've been invisible.  For $16.99, I got mostly breading and cheese.  I'll stick to my favorite Arizona Italian restaurant for an authentic Italian dinner, Va Bene's.

But they were busy, So I understand. \n\nMy 3 star review is on the salad I got (I know right, who gets a salad at a BBQ place, this dummy does) I got the Avocado Club Salad with Brisket. For Avocado being the first descriptive word i was expecting a TON of avocado in this salad, I was soooo excited for all the avocado I would be consuming, unfortunately there were maybe 5 or 6 very very veryyy small pieces of avocado in the whole salad (trust me I searched that salad bowl over) not even a half of an avocado...so maybe just call t the Cobb salad and be done with it?

"I 100% disagree with Shantel M. that there's something wrong with the plain tart frozen yogurt at City Girl. In fact, I think their plain tart is better than Cocomero, and possibly better than Pink Berry too. I strongly suggest sampling it before getting it if you're concerned, but neither I nor anyone else I know has complained about the plain tart tasting bad or 'rancid.' Perhaps this was a one time anomaly?\n\nIt does seem a tad short sighted of City Girl Yogurt to use 'girl' in the title. I'm all for girl only spaces but I'm not sure they're in a position to do so, considering they're competing with Cocomero which is already fairly well established in the Champaign Urbana area. I thought having to change the name would be a blessing, but unfortunately they didn't want to make a big change and I think it's going to hold them back.\n\nEdit: My bad on the fruit comment. I know for sure the strawberries are fresh, but haven't been in the shop for some time and may have made a mistake in my original post. I do stand by the 'girl' in the title thing even though, as Amanda Y points out, it's not meant to encourage a girl only space. Sorry Amanda, I've had to drive self conscious males all the way to Cocomero in spite of my very close to proximity to City Girl. = \\ Maybe now that it's City Girl rather than Skinni Girl fewer males will avoid it. I certainly hope so.",332,3
"An ice-cream (I mean, gelato) shop this good probably increases property values in the area. Love the molten chocolate cake flavor and the coffee / cappuccino flavors. The quality and quantity of the chunky stuff they put in the gelato here is above and beyond the best you've seen. Every single bite of gelato has some kind of morsel or chunk in it, unless of course you get sorbet or some other plain flavor. The mint chocolate chip here will redefine the flavor for you. Very rich and decadent.\n\nThe servers can be hesitant to offer you more than 2 samples of flavors, so choose your samples wisely! A must-try if you are on the West side. Hot-rod / chopper friendly parking spots right in front of the storefront windows, too.",160,3

Today was one of those days where I forgot to defrost something for dinner and I just didn't feel like leftovers so I grabbed my trusty Rosati's menu. I decided on chicken wings & fries and then my eyes sort of drifted over to the Appetizer selection where I saw Polenta Nuggets. What are Polenta Nuggets you ask? Well I'll tell you. They are wonderful little nuggets of creamy garlic parmesan polenta that are deep fried (two of my favorite words in the English language) and they're served with a side of meat sauce.  I'd never heard of them and I think they must be fairly new because I haven't seen them on the menu before. My food was delivered piping hot and about 20 minutes earlier than the anticipated delivery time. The wings and fries were delicious. The Polenta Nuggets -- well as I took my first bite I think I heard angels singing. This is a great addition to the menu and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something new.,210,4
"One of the nicest bowling alleys I've been to- it's actually updated and not old/smelly like other places. It does get really busy here so be prepared to arrive early or wait. We came here on a Sunday night and was around $10 a person for 3 hours of bowling and shoes. My fianc\u00e9 and I are actually looking to join a bowling league here too, since it's nice and close to our house!",100,3
"First and foremost, I don't come here for the Sushi. I come here for the Happy Hour which starts at 4:30pm. Domestic beers are cheap $3 for Bud Light, $5 for imports like Kirin, and Hot Sake is only $2! And when I get really drunk then I will venture into the menu and order the Americanized fusion sushi that always usually contains cream cheese. Why the hell does all the sushi contain cream cheese? RA sushi is to Japanese food as Taco Bell is to Mexican...far from what it's supposed to be. \n\nGet your pre party on here for cheap and get a Las Vegas Roll when you're drunk enough to wanna eat the sushi here. The waitresses were very nice and there was a DJ when I was there. \n\nThis place is conveniently located in the Fashion Mall, so you can walk off  the gratuitous amounts of food and alcohol in an A/C filled ambience!",201,2
"It's nice to have a Chinese restaurant so close to the residential areas in Chandler.  However, this particular location does not ever have anything for vegetarians.  I've been consistently disappointed and would rather drive to a \""real\"" Chinese place a few miles away.",56,0
"The pizza at Sauce is the best!  I've had pizza in Italy (Rome, Tuscany, Umbria, etc) and love it there; I'm always disappointed by the pizza here in the US, and have only found a few places in the entire country that do what I consider to be a good crust; 'Sauce' manage to get it right! (the other fabulous place in the US is 'Pizza Antica' in Lafayette, CA).  \n\nI don't understand another reviewer complaining about the amount of meat in the pizza; pizza is not about piles of meat, it is about a combination of ingredients - a perfect balance. \n\nThe pastas and salads are also absolutely spot-on - every salad and pasta I've had has tasted fresh and has good ingredients. My only complaint about Sauce is that you can't sit outside and drink beer!  On a warm summer's evening, you must sit inside (in the over-cooled air) rather than sit at a table outside.  I know this is due to some local city rule, but still - has prevented me from going there more than once.  \n\nThe pricing and service are also extremely good.",253,4
"I'm Vietnamese and I grew up eating Vietnamese food everyday.  Let me tell you, this place is a big let down.  I don't know why people are giving it such rave reviews.  All my Viet friends in this city also avoid this place because it really is NOT good.  \n\nThe portions are tiny, and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied.  It lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have.  I've had pho at home and in 30+ different pho restaurants and this was probably in my top 5 most disappointing.  As for the other dishes, it comes to the table looking like someone already ate it or like a jumbled mess.\n\nThis is aside from the service..I actually like the old man that works there...he's the only reason I give it two stars.",178,1
"With the slogan of \""breakfast, lunch, and bacon\"", I would expect the restaurant to have multiple interesting and fun dishes with a focus on quality bacon. If this is what you are looking for, do not visit oink. \n\nThe service was ok, family run it seemed. A little disorganized, but it hasn't been open long so I'm sure that this will get better.\n\nThe food is standard breakfast and lunch. Most items do not include bacon as an ingredient and there are only 1-2 fun bacon dishes (such as bacon pancakes).\n\nI ordered the French toast combo with honey cured bacon and hash browns. The French toast was ok, pretty typical. The hash browns were not fully cooked and the bacon was not very impressive and tasted like the cheap stuff you pick up at your local grocery store.\n\nI strongly recommend that the owner check out some good bacon focused meat companies such as Broadbent, who has an amazing dry-cured bacon. If you like good bacon, join the zingerman's bacon club which will introduce you into several tasty varieties from across the country.\n\nOink should rethink its menu and name and try to bring the two in line with each other. \n\nGood luck oink, the idea is great but execution needs a little work.",277,2

"After emailing the owners, we received a gift certificate for $50, which we used on Sunday brunch today.  We used Open Table to make online reservations and we brought our 2 children ages 8 and 10.

"Great massage experience. It is not only a food reflexology, which is good, and they also massage my shoulder and neck. My neck was killing me, it is really helpful.\n\n$20=0.5 hour, $30=1 hour, $45= 1.5 hour, $60= 2 hour, no extra charge for credit card. \nBest price I ever see. \n\nIt is Amazing!!",98,4
Awesome bar happy hour with decent food offerings and drinks. Very cool interior and atmosphere. Restaurant is amazing too.,23,3
"This place is ok.  Most of their items come in HUGE portions, so I guess it kind of makes up for the price. \n\nThe wait for seating in the restaurant is pretty bad, but the nice thing is that you can put your name down and they text you when your table is ready.  This enables you to go walk around inside Cesar's palace and explore and play while waiting.  This also enabled me to grab a few drinks at their \""to-go\"" counter at the front.  They ran out of whatever they use to make smoothies--and whenever someplace can't get a handle on their inventory I dock stars.  I got the hot chocolate and it was pretty good and filled me up enough to last until we were called for brunch.\n\nService is SO slow here, which is definitely a downer when you've been waiting so long for your table in the first place.  I could have sworn there was only one server in charge of the whole patio area on Sunday brunch.\n\nI got the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and my boyfriend got the Crab Cake Benedict.  I really liked the corned beef hash, because you could tell they had cured and prepared the meat themselves so it was definitely fresh. The Crab Cake Benedict was also very good, but was a smaller portion compared to everything else and much higher priced--but I guess that should be expected for seafood during brunch.\n\nI do want to try their $90+ treasure chest dessert someday though.\n\nOverall, the food is good but not mindblowing, and the portions are huge. But with all the amazing restaurants in Vegas, you can get a better deal for your money elsewhere.",355,1
"Pizza was ok, not great. The reason for one one star is as follows...\n\nI called and asked if they still had the five dollar large pizza. They replied yes that they did. So I ordered one pepperoni and then another half pepperoni and half Hawaiian. The total came to $16. I told them I thought the pizzas were five dollars? They said it was extra for the Hawaiian. I said they didn't tell me that on the phone. I specifically asked about the five dollar pizza. They should've mentioned that. So they charged me 6  dollars for a half Hawaiian which was clearly a rip off. And the large pizza is more like a medium. Will stick with Little Caesars.",148,0
"I was leaving for a trip to South America a few weeks before Christmas (2012) and needed a Brazilian. I also purchased a spa pedicure. \n\nI did tons of research on Yelp which let me to Judit's (Yoo-deet's) spa. I arrived about 15 minutes early and was greeted by Judit's mother, Elizabeth, who took my coat and offered me something to drink. We chatted for a bit since Judit was still finishing up with her first client of the day. Once Judit was done, she came to get me and led me down a small corridor to a private waxing room.\n\nJudit and I talked most of the time, which really helped make me feel comfortable and also distract me from the pain. She did a very thorough job and was professional the entire time. Once finished she gave me a cloth with some oil to use to clean up.\n\nThe pedicure was performed immediately following my Brazilian. But before starting, Elizabeth asked me where I was parked. I explained where I had left my car and she asked if I was aware they were now charging for parking there. I told her I was not aware and she asked where I left the car. I explained where it was parked and she went to the register and took out several coins and asked if she could use my jacket quickly (it was freezing out!) to run out to put coins in the meter. I couldn't believe how thoughtful she had been in thinking to ask where I was parked and then to actually go out, look for my car, and put money in before I got a ticket. Talk about customer service. \n\nOnce back, Judit's mother prepped my feel and did the first part of the pedicure (foot soak/bath, exfoliation, etc) before Judit came to do the paraffin bootie treatment, nail shaping, and polish. Judit took plenty of time on the pedicure, making sure everything was perfectly shaped. It was a very good pedicure, much better than the last one I had had done at a place called Salon Beleza in Mount Lebanon (a Groupon purchase). As we worked through the pedicure, more and more customers started showing up. Elizabeth and Judit told me most people come to her specifically for Brazilian waxes and pedicures. They also do facials among other services, but those seem to be the most requested. Clearly, Judit knows how to do a good bikini wax because she mentioned she had 20 more bikini wax appointments just that day!\n\nOverall, it was a very good experience. Judit worked quickly and efficiently with my wax and left me feeling comfortable  as a first-timer.  The pedicure was beautifully done and Elizabeth went above and beyond by putting change in my meter. I would definitely go back again and recommend her to any of my friends.",595,4
"We went for happy hour on a Friday night.  It was really busy and we sat outside until a table was available. Which was fine.  It is a really nice patio area.  The ambiance is nice as well.  The restaurant has it;s finer points, however it is way over priced for the food you get.  I had flat bread and baked goat cheese.  Neither were bad, they just were not great either.   Our tab was almost $70 for 4 drinks and two appetizers.   The service was really slow.  When we were finished and the waitress brought our check, the bus boy came around and started taking everything from the table, including what was left of my wine I was still finishing. Granted there was not much left in the glass to speak of and I wasn't paying attention when he came around.   But hello, we are still sitting here.  You bus the table when people leave, not while they are finishing up.  I understand removing dinner plates and things of that nature, but they were removing everything on the table. I just find that rude.   Anyhow, I would go back for drinks, but not for food.  There are much better places to eat in town for the price then this place.  .",262,1
"I recently did the Grand Canyon Tour with the wife and some friends.  After procrastinating as long as I could, I finally placed a call on a Friday afternoon for a Saturday tour (I know, I know, not smart).  Ended up talking to a young lady named Laura.  I must say, for getting a cold call for a tour the next morning, she was utterly fantastic.  I wanted to do the deluxe tour, which included transportation, the actual GC tour, and lunch.  All this without having received confirmation from my bud that HE actually wanted to do this.  Laura was cool enough to pencil me in, and was very patient through the entire process.  She even gave me her direct extension to give her a shout after I finally figured out what we (as a group) were doing.\n\nI called back about 20 minutes later and did the deal....and was glad I did.  The bus arrived to pick us up at the Wynn pretty much on schedule.  This was a \""feeder\"", taking us to Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile Shops to parse out the paperwork on all the tour customers, get them on the right bus with the right tour tags, etc.  This took about 20 minutes, and we were off to the GC!\n\nThe bus guide was relatively (in a corny way) entertaining...but definitely made the 50+ minute trip seem shorter.  Once we pulled into the new visitors center/bus parking, we started the regular GC tour (see separate review).\n\nUpon our return, we were off to the mandatory stop at Ethel M Chocolates (methinks they pay serious bank to ALL the bus tour companies to stop here).\n\nWe then got the first shocker....this is more of a heads up then anything else.  The bus driver was responsible for taking each customer back to his/her hotel.  We're talking a standard touring bus, so you can imagine the potential for watching the day slip away dropping off patrons across LV (with those wonderful 20 minute traffic lights...ok, maybe not, but sure seems that way).  Luckily for us, we'd done the Deluxe package, so we were the 2nd stop (whew!).\n\nOk, 2nd shocker - buying the Deluxe package does indeed get you lunch, to some degree.  It gives you, in reality, a $10 credit good at any restaurant in the Miracle Mile Shops.  Yeah, you MIGHT be able to eat for $10 each, but good luck.   Oh...wait...that's not the shocker...the real shocker is that said lunch is WELL after 3pm.  Just another heads up.\n\nSaid Deluxe package also included taxi vouchers to get us back to our hotel.  This, alas, was the final shocker, which took this review from a five star to a three - said voucher is through Whittlesea Cab - a cab company that is (from what we saw in 15 minutes of looking), nonexistent at the taxi stand at MMS.  We talked to every taxi company that pulled up, NONE would take the voucher.s.  We called the # on the vouchers, where we were informed that \""we don't dispatch cabs for vouchers.  You can either wait for one of our cabs, or just pay to get back\"".  Nice.\n\nIn this case, another company directly impacted the review - too bad for GC Tours, but at the end of the day, they're the ones who sold the Deluxe Package, so own the score.\n\nI definitely recommend them, but not the Deluxe Package (for obvious reasons).  And do be aware of the realities of the end of the day drop-off.  Logistically not a whole lot you can do about it, but that doesn't change the suck factor.",813,2
"This has become my 'corner-shop' and whilst it might be a bit more pricey than the old Spar of my youth, it's far more tasty. How good my morning poached eggs and bacon taste coupled with the spicy tomato chutney. Or how delicious my lunchtime sandwich with the thick-cut Blacky ham. Or how deliciously different a dinner of tapas can be with the chickpea salad, smoked duck and one of their home-made desserts.\n\nThere aren't many other delis in this area, and Victor Hugo does provide very well for the continental meat and cheese lovers, as well as olive oils, balsamic vinegars and other pickles, and jars of spices and flavours. They have tasty cakes too, although I think the ones atop the counter are bought in (as many can be in delis in Edinburgh).\n\nThe customer service here is still what lets it down. The staff are always a little confused about who is doing what task, it's slow, there's often a queue. It happens far too frequently, in fact it never *not* happens, for it to be a fluke or coincidence. I do like Victor Hugo for the food, and it's not that the staff aren't nice - it's just ever since my last Sunday brunch incident I've not wanted to sit in, and several times I've had to wait 20 minutes in a queue just to buy a jar of my beloved tomato pickle. Ah well.\n\nIt is popular with locals, a great spot in the sun for a coffee. The home-made food is nice, and their Supper Club looks good on a Friday night. I'm glad Victor Hugo is my very fine 'corner shop' for milk, rye bread, and houmous. Oh and don't forget the morning rolls. Sunday saviour.",382,2
"Maybe we came here on an off Saturday night but the food was not good. We both had the spaghetti and meatballs. Pasta was overcooked, sauce was not at all flavorful and the meatballs tasted as if they had been frozen and just warmed.  One of them was still cold in the middle. Wine by the glass was $15+. There are so many other great restaurants in vegas I would pass on this one.",86,1
"Awful. Just awful. \n\nI could have dealt with the grainy queso fresco. I could have overlooked the undercooked corn tortillas. I was even partially amused by the eccentric (AKA somewhat rude) service. But when my girlfriend ordered the enchiladas with red sauce, it literally had NO TASTE. How is that even possible?  It just tasted like...well...red. My only working theory is that there are some five pound boxes of cayenne and paprika that have been sitting around on a shelf since 1973 and have completely evaporated any and all volatile flavor ingredients.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the chorizo and the picadillo tasted exactly like Taco Bell beef. BOTH of them.\n\nNever, never again.",158,0
I have taken my dog here for a fews years on and off. Recently my 13 yo cat got into a fight and had an infected wound.  She has never been to a vet.

I will always use their office for all my vet needs from here on out. Thx Best Friends for truly caring.,97,4
"Stopped in finally after my vegetarian wife insisted we try it.   Picked up two Falafel pitas per the girls suggestion for a first timer.  My wife wasn't present.   To go please.  Sat down and waited.  Another employee walked in and started talking to her.   A bit later she came out with two pita''s clearly not ready to walk out the door.  Simple said these were to go and she turned around and walked back.  5 minutes later she walked over again with the two sandwich and no bag.  Asked politely if she had a bag and she said yes, would you like one?  I decided to wait at the counter because she clearly kept loosing focus.  Handed me my food and I left.   My wife's initial response.  Was this made today???  Yuck.   Head out to Chipotle honey.\n\nI just guessing that this place has potential but lacks management to watch over this place until they get some good employees..  Said we really need healthy options in this area.",217,0
"I absoutely hated this place!!!\n\nSMALL..SMALL..SMALL!!!\n\nI saw 2 consession stands...$5 for a hot dog, $7 for a beer, not to bad, but you are squeezed into this little space with 50 other people..the line never moved!!!!\n\nWent and saw Wynonna Judd..the ticket and website said show starts at 8pm....at 8:15pm this homely looking guy and his dog walks on stage and starts telling people he is the owner and tells what shows are coming up.....GHETTO!!!!!! Then he introduces 3 teenage girls from Chandler who are going to warm up the audience....I thought ok..maybe 2 or 3 songs and they will bring Wynonna on.....NOOOOOO!!!! These girls played for almost an hour...it was HORRIBLE!!!!\n\nFinally..9:30 Wynonna came on....once again this place is so small, the audience interrupted her the whole time she was onstage...people walking up to the stage extending their hand, asking her to take a picture with them, yelling out songs for her to sing, yelling out profanitys...It was HORRIBLE!!!!\n\nI will not be back!!!",265,0
"Maybe the oil is too hot which makes the outside crust slightly burnt on the chicken. The waffles are edible at best. And, the price for the amount for avg food just makes no sense.  I like to support local options but this place just isn't much of one. Better off going to Chilli Palmer's or going to neighborhood wal-mart for their chicken and some egos. They try hard and they have a discount for after school.",92,0
"The food was good(a little greasy), but the service was molasses-slow. I think it had something to do with me using a deal voucher (provided by Yelp ironically). I would probably return, because I really did enjoy my order, I just hope I receive better service next time.",60,2
"So many of my friends are so in love with this place,  so I was super excited to come here. \nI really liked the decor.  I prefer a giant bar/lounge to a restaurant any day.  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly and super attentive.  I'll come back just for drinks and the service.  \nThe food, eh, not so much.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things... We shared a brushetta and it had a taste in it I did not like.  It was good except the overwhelming olive taste.  If you like olives, you'll love the brushetta.  We then shared the Proschiutto di Parma pizza.  I love proschiutto but their's had to have been cured with a pound of salt because I've never had prosciutto as salty as this and I realize that proschiutto is a salty meat.  There was also a lot more arugula on the pizza than I expected.  I thought just a sprinkling, maybe; but ended up with enough for each of us to have a side spring salad.  I couldn't taste the sauce or cheese on the pizza.  I could just taste salt and arugula.  Total bummer.\nLike I said before though, great service and atmosphere worth coming back for.  I know I'll be back for drinks and will try something else to give them a chance at redeeming the reputation that preceeded my visit.",309,2
"When cupcake is ur staple then I expect them to b phenomenal unfortunately they took a back seat to the food. I'd come here again for sure but not for the cupcakes--frosting was terrible, I can tell it's a butter cream of sorts but it's not tasty; I did however love the icing in the center--for some reason they don't use the same on top, what a costly miss.",88,2
"Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi is a good neighborhood sushi restaurant where you have the option to order Ala Carte or All You Can Eat.  They have a good variety of hot and cold appetizers like soft-shell crab, tako yaki, and raw oysters.  They have all the basic nigiri like salmon, ikura, hamachi, and ahi; and also creative rolls with various fillers, like California or shrimp tempura inside and different toppings like spicy ahi, unagi, and sauces on top the rolls.\n\nThe All You Can Eat is a good value as the Ala Carte plates can add up quickly.  The interior is modern and pretty, and for better or worse has TVs throughout the dinning room showing sports and playing music videos.\n\nTake your time (you get 1.5 hours for the All You Can Eat), enjoy the company, and eat a lot of pretty decent sushi for an affordable price.",192,3
Thankful for this place. It's great knowing that there is a place close by that I can take my pet in an emergency. The staff is friendly and caring.

"I really wafted between 2 and 3 stars for this place. Both times I went the food was ok, but the service was so incredibly bad, I can't justify giving it more than 2 stars. Also, yes, it is in a hotel, but wow, just wow, was it expensive. Like appallingly so. I don't think I'll go back.",83,1
"Our garage door torsion spring broke last night.  We called this morning and got an appointment set up right away.  Kenny showed up on time and fixed the problem in just 20 minutes.  I have read DIY material about how to replace garage door springs, so I know what to expect.  But it is still such a joy to see Kenny do his job so efficiently.  He projects great confidence in what he does, and it makes me very comfortable in knowing that his job is highly reliable.  Not to mention all this is done at a below the market average price!  I will definitely call them again for any garage door problem in the future!",136,4
"The food wasn't that great.  I ordered papas con carne, the pork was pretty dry.  I guess I didn't read the menu description because when I think of \""papas\"" I think chunks of potatoes but Tia Rosa serves pureed potatoes.  The flour tortillas were the highlight of the meal, I asked if they made them but they buy them from a distributor.  I used the tortillas to scoop up the meat and topped it with the potato mixture to cure the dry meat.  It was definitely something I had never had before.\n\nThe margaritas were excellent and the bartender was awesome.",128,2

Some of the best trucks no longer attend. Security harassing people just trying to enjoy a beer and sample the food. Over crowded, fenced in area. Making us feel like cattle. I don't think it is worth the effort to try the new trucks. This was a great event that has now lost me.",102,2
"I had high hopes Taj Palace but should have known that this place is destined to be another flop in the bucket of sub par Indian restaurants in Las Vegas. My family and I had dinner here last night. We ordered several different naans, rotis, and kulchas. The naans were undercooked and you could pull at the doughy centers. The rotis were too thick and you couldn't tell them apart from the naan. We ordered chicken kadai and butter chicken. Both dishes are rich but the oil floating on top of the chicken kadai was just gross. The chicken pieces in the murgh makani (butter chicken) were strange bits with tiny bones. I was hoping for good quality white chicken breast. We also ordered a shrimp dish but all you could taste was the tomato base. It lacked the spicy kick we were looking forward to. On the other hand, the servers were very polite and friendly. The ambiance could use improvement. I'm all about energy efficient lighting, but the white lights gave the place a cafeteria-like feel. \nHow much longer do we have to wait before we can get the quality Indian food of cities like Chicago, NY and LA?",244,1

I feel like this is a REAL nice place for dinner as far as the atmosphere but nothing on the menu really gets me the need to eat here.  I ordered a spinach enchilada and avocado enchilada with beans and potatoes.  The spinach one was good but the avocado wasn't special, the beans were less than average but the potatoes were kinda of different but in a good way.  I wish I could find something here that I could crave because the service is always good and the atmosphere is just awesome.  Guess I will keep coming here till I find my combo.",161,2
"One of the two best places to go for ice cream/gelato in Las Vegas.  This newer spot on Las Vegas Boulevard near the Stratosphere is just wonderful.\n\nWe came here for a sweet treat and we weren't disappointed.  I had the sweet corn and my wife had the pistachio gelato.  Both were very good.  There are several tables so you don't have to go back to your car to enjoy your frozen treat!\n\nThe woman who owns the place is just a delight.  She is so friendly and she wants to have you try almost every flavor she makes. The shop is clean and bright and welcoming.  There is a bathroom and it was kept nicely clean.  In addition to the gelato, she serves some baked goods and coffee and tea.\n\nThe parking is the only potential drawback.  During the day, it's probably more difficult to get a space here but I got one right in front of the sexy clothing women's store.  Viva Las Vegas!\n\nI'll be back to try the chocolate gelato with two peppers to give it some heat with the cold.",239,4
"I'll have to go with Mr. K on this one, a definite pass.  There are three other hookah lounges all within a half mile of Oasis and they are all worlds better than this one.  Go to Urban Cafe or even King Tuts, just anywhere but here. \n\nThe food is mediocre, nothing stood out one way or the other.  The music was a little annoying, but I'm not really into pop music or hip-hop, but I suppose people who are would enjoy it.  However, the service is absolutely terrible.  I've been there twice and on both occasions the (extremely late) delivery of food saved me from walking out the door.  Their hookahs are not good, and you practically have to tackle an employee if you want more coals.\n\nSave yourself the frustration and go to Urban Cafe or King Tuts.  Urban is a bit more for the mediterranean loving, less-frills crowd.  Tuts if you still like your hip-hop and being surrounded by ASU students.",219,1
"YES!  I loved this place.  Had a double cheeseburger plain (bread, meat, cheese) and the flavor, texture, size was just perfect.  The peanut butter cup and banana concrete was super good.\n\nMy only complaint is cost.  It is quite pricey.  We ordered one burger, an order of 3 chicken tenders, a small milkshake, a small concrete and a small sundae.  Our bill was $22.  We had no fries, no drinks.",105,3
"This Place is most excellent.  It has:\n\na) Great atmosphere: cozy and comfortable, friendly waiters, interesting layout and decor.\n\nb) Great Food:  The pizzas had crispy and tasty crust (perfectly cooked), the cheese and sauce were the perfect amount of taste (not overwhelming the pizza), the toppings where fresh and plentiful.\n\nc) Not much waiting: Greeted and Seated right away.  Ordered withing five minutes of sitting.  Carafe of water at table is a plus.  Took about eight minutes to receive pizza.\n\nd) Desert:  Monday is \""Messy Sunday\"" Day.  Free \""Messy Sunday\"" with an order over $30.  Here is the kicker.  The bill didn't quite make it to $30 but the waitress gave us one anyway.  It says a lot that they are willing to go the extra mile for their customers.\n\nDefinitely Try this place at least once.  Each pizza is a personal size.

"I should have listened to my fellow yelpers but I decided to take a chance anyways...and what a mistake it was!\n\nThe hostess was very nice and we were seated right away.  The waiter came over and right away he had an attitude.  When I asked him if they had any flavored lemonade or iced tea he told me yes.  When I asked what flavors they had he told me that they had pink lemonade, which has a lemonade flavor and regular iced tea, which has an iced tea flavor!  So obviously he did not understand my question correctly and his answers were very condescending.  \n\nI told him that we needed a few more minutes and to please come back.  When he came back we still hadn't decided and I could tell that he wasn't happy about having to wait for us.  Instead of being polite and checking back in a few more minutes he decided to have a ten minute conversation with the table next to us completely ignoring us.  \n\nAfter being talked down to and then ignored we got up to leave and only THEN the waiter asked if we wanted to order something.  I told him NO that we were going somewhere else that had better service.  He happily smiled and said O.K.  \n\nI have NEVER walked out of a restaurant in my life!  But I certainly wasn't going to spend my good money to be talked down to and ignored by the waiter.  This waiter does not in any way reflect the class of Mandalay Bay and how such a poor service provider can be employed in a hotel of this class I have no idea.  I will not be recommending this restaurant to any one!",350,0
"My best find since moving to Scottsdale!\n\nShaving Grace exceeded my expectations. Cool, old world shop. All of the previous reviews are spot on. Clientele during my visit ranged from early 20's to late 50's. \n\nI highly recommend Alex and look forward to my return visit in a few weeks!",75,4
Classic gym scammers\n\nI have been at this gym for over a year and a half and the place was either too crowded or gym equipment was broken. So I started working out on my own and decided to cancel my membership. Went online and cancelled it. The website told me that my last day to go into the gym was Feb. 13th and that they were sad to see me go. Feb. 15th comes around and there is a $29.99 bill on my bank statement from them. I call and get a good amount of attitude from the women that I talked to but she finally agrees to cancel my account but would not refund my $29.99. March 15th comes around and lo and behold there is another $29.99 change from these scam artists. Called again and now they are telling me that I have to come in and cancel in person. WOW!!!!!!!! \n\nPlease do not ever give them your bank account number as they will lie to you just to make another $29.99 off you. Or $59.98 as is in my case.\n\nLetting the Better Business Bureau now about this as well.,254,0
"I really enjoyed Mabel's. we got there early enough to get a table, but it wasn't completely empty. It definitely filled up shortly there after. All of the staff was very nice. Never felt like they hated their job or the two woman using a Yelp deal. I enjoyed the DJ. He played stuff I haven't heard in a really long time and it was fun to get up and dance for a bit since the staff accommodated for the crowd. The only bad I would say is there was a photographer there that took a really cute pic of us and told us to check the website for it. The pics haven't been updated since 2011 on the website.",143,3
"What I love about this store is the seafood department. They have an array of fresh fish that on-site they will clean and cut any way you like including fillet. They will also fry the fish for you if you like too. They also have very nice cuts of meat. I love Lee Lee's because I am Puerto Rican and only these Asian markets have our specialty items. However, for as many flaws I find in Lee Lee's I find the same at Mekong. They are equal and when I want fresh fish this is where I will be!!!!!",114,3
"What is the best pizza?  New York for sure!  What is the closest you can get to that around here?  Village Pizza!  We order for delivery, take out and eat in the restaurant.  I also order catering for my work.  The owner is super friendly and helpful, willing to work within my budget on catering events.  The buffet is very good with a nice selection of pizza and a nicely filled salad bar with a couple of pastas at the end.  But don't stop there!  Order a sub or entree off the menu.  I have had the meatball sub, stuffed shells and eggplant parmesan.  They are yummy!  Look at the daily specials.  They are a good idea to run by and take dinner home.",158,4
"I love love love this place! The tmb sandwich is the best around. Everything from the bread, to the cheese to the veggies are fresh and flavorful. A definite must try if you're downtown. But don't expect there to be much seating though. It's pretty much a to go kinda place. There's a few benches outside, but it's pretty much take and go. So just a little heads up. They even have a few salads there, the caprese is the best. Try it, it's good and a definite repeat kind of place.",121,4
"I saw a similar review to what I am about to write from Bill F down below and I just have to agree and say the same and add to it. \n\nWent there on 6/12/13 ... service is HORRIBLE. Went around 9:15 at night still 45min before closing. There are 6 people behind the counter doing work, except actually helping us out. Finally one of them decides to help us (there are two of us no one else in line) Was about the slowest process I've ever seen in my life. took us over 15 min to get through. Part of the problem was NO ONE was helping him. I asked a question about the desserts (as he was making my food) so he had to stop what he was doiong ask, go get someone, etc ... instead of her just taking the initiative.\n\nSo Service was SLOWWW.\n\nFood was OK, above a taco bell but does that really say much?\n\nI asked if i could have black beans with my quesadilla, apparently it doesnt come with it and I can't have that. We also bought a burrito and apparently hot sauce is an extra cost, really hot sauce?\n\nAnyways this was my 3rd time and last time there.",277,0
"Just moved here from CA and we were hoping to find a pizza joint in the area  that was as awesome as some of the ones back home. Well, this place didn't disappoint! Their pizzas are HUGE. We got the sicilian and it's totally enough for 3-4 people. Crunchy on the bottom, soft in the middle, with real pepperoni on top. This place is definitely getting our return business. We can't wait to go back and try everything else! The pizza did take quite a while to get out to us, but that's just because it's fresh. And there's a small arcade!",133,4
"Was in the neighborhood and decided to check it out. I had the oxtail dinner with a side of mac n cheese, dressing, and collard greens. and sweet tea. I will review each item individually. \n\nPros:\n1. you are greeted immediately as you enter by friendly staff\n2. I received complimentary pancakes\n\nCons:\n1.wait. Took me five minutes to get my drink. I came in at 430 didn't leave until 5 with my food that i ordered to go. the menu does state extended times for fried dishes though\n2. small portions for certain dishes, (oxtail)\n\nNow onto the food:\n1.Oxtails- I am Jamaican and we make oxtails differently but I wanted to try them southern style. I was a bit disappointed. There was mostly fat on the bone and I know oxtail is not the cheapest of meats but i should not pay near twenty bucks for a meal and get kiddie portions.\n2. mac n cheese- it was nothing spectacular. You could tell whomever made this batch put way too much Lawry's season salt in it. because that's all I could taste. \n3. dressing- it tasted great but was a bit too mushy for me and smothered with gravy on top. The oxtails already had gravy and then more gravy was put on the dressing, too much gravy for me.\n4. collard greens- again, nothing special. needed some more flavor and spice\n\n5. sweet tea- I ordered it and got it in this little mason jar. Um, hello, I'm an adult. a bigger glass please. It was OK tasting as well.\n\nlastly is the complimentary cornbread pancakes, or whatever you want to call them. I was puzzled by this. Since when does a soul food restaurant serve cornbread pancakes? What ever happened to traditional cornbread served square? And they were so thin!\n\n\nOver all this place get 3 stars. idk about A-ok, it was just OK. I will return again though and try something else on the menu. this place isnt horrible, it isnt faboulous either.",466,2
"Two items that I LOVE, Pizza Cookie and Pablo Picasso Salad.  Otherwise don't bother going.  Yes its crowed, yes the parking is a pain, yes the food is amazing.  If a place is crowed there is a good reason for it!  The food is good, and people like the ambiance.  They have tons of outside seating which in Arizona is like 8 months out of the year a good choice.  If you don't want to wait 30-60 minutes don't go after 5PM on a Friday or Saturday otherwise what did you expect?  This place gets crowded even for lunch so try and go at odd hours really early before or right at 11AM for lunch, no later than 5:30PM for Dinner.  I take all out of visitors to Oreganos because I love it so.\n\nPS if you try and park in their parking lot you are idiot and you deserve the hassle it causes what do you expect with 4 spots?  Seriously?   Park on the side streets people!",225,4
"I've eaten at several steakhouses on the strip including Carnevino and Craftsteak, and can say without hesitation that Echo and Rig is by far the best steakhouse in Las Vegas.  I was particularly impressed by their commitment to sourcing food locally, and the selection and  quality of the meat offered was outstanding.  The service was impeccable.  Our server, Brian, was friendly and impressively knowledgeable about every item on the menu which he took the time to explain to my dining partner and I.  The ambience was sleek and modern, but relaxed and not the least bit pretentious.  Shortly after we were seated we were offered the choice of flat or sparkling water free of charge and a tray of focaccia bread with butter was brought to our table.  My dining partner and I ordered the kennebec salt and pepper fries as an appetizer, and  the Jumping Beef and the Bavette as our entrees.  All steak entrees are served with a stuffed mushroom, homemade chips and a selection of as many sauces as you'd like.  The accompaniments with the steak selections is certainly a rare find as most upscale steakhouses offer sides ala carte. We  finished off our meal with a decadent caramel and sea salt ice cream sundae that was more than big enough to share. Every dish was delicious, perfectly cooked and artfully presented.  We had all of that food along with three beers and coffee for  $85.00.  There is no way a meal like that for two people would have cost so little on the strip.  I highly recommend Echo and Rig to anyone who wants a wonderful meal, in a beautiful setting, with impeccable service at an extraordinarily reasonable price.  We will definitely be back.",356,4
"Sorry not a fan..Turkey Sandwich was boring tasting..fries were soggy and greasy, even my daughter who love fries didn't really care for them. My husbands pastrami was very good though, without the fries! Staff was very unfriendly.",50,1
I realize they're in this business for the money but jeez being my first time here it would've been awesome had you told me to wait 5 minutes and I'd get my tacos for less than half the price. Or at least give me the happy hour price. That alone would have proved to be great customer service and wouldve made a customer for life. But thanks for nothing guys. I wont be back.,89,0
The service here was terrible. Standing in front of a cashier who was counting money for about 10 minutes. While she was doing that the cashier next to her kept looking at me then called out people behind me to take their order. After that other cashier takes those guy's order I stand in her line and wait another 10 minutes. \n\nI wish I took her name down so I could put it on blast.\n\nI ordered what they were known for. The hot dog. I had it with mustard. Nothing special. Great snap to the hot dog and great flavor. I should have just eaten here than at the Luxor buffet.,137,2
"I was craving Mexican and had heard about this place from a couple of locals in Vegas. All I can say is I guess people have varying taste. I had the beef taco, chili relleno and a tamale. The beef taco was soaked in marinade, the chili relleno had zero flavor and the tamale that this place is their staple signature dish was as dry as the desert this Las Vegas town sits in. The only thing I found good here was the chips and the service. Pass on this place.",102,0
"I have just been living in Vegas for 6 months and have been trying to find somebody to cut my hair. I had gone to two other places, that shall remain nameless, and was horribly disappointed. I was losing hope of ever finding a place to cut my hair until I found Fino's. This place is unbelievable and their hair stylists are incredible. I had my haircut done by Jose, and I highly recommend him to everybody. I love that I can actually make an appointment and show up and just be taken in. Other places in Vegas are first come first serve. I'm sorry, but I value my time and do not feel like waiting around 3 hours for someone to do my hair.  Also, initially when I tried getting hold of Fino, their phone was down, due to century link. However, I emailed them through their site and Alejandro their CEO got back to me right away, and schedule me for an appointment. Truly Fino's knows the definition of customer care and I will surely be getting my haircut's there from now on.",218,4
Also note they lie when you fight it with your bank.  Sadly I left the country to move back to England so communicating with the bank is so slow this company days in lied to steal money from me when I never stayed there. I actually booked with a better place that was not a **** hole of a place. Trust me. Same price by the airport and your in a luxury.  Don't trust this pace. Unfair 15 mins refund before you even see a room. Rooms are disgusting. Cheap and not worth 25 to 30 dollars including tax and that's being fair.  Owner is well full of him self and cares not about his customers. That's why they hide the 15 mins warning out of plan site. \n\nAny hotel or motel will and should let you see a room before you commit. So don't trust this place and if you want bed bugs. I can bet this place does. Sheets looked old. \n\nBe very careful. Go to better places. Check airport hotels. Same price and so much better.,227,0
"We found this little cafe by chance and actually had to come back to that side of town in order to check it out.  Service was quick and efficient and friendly until we told the young lady that the potatoe pancakes were not to our liking.  She offered mashed potatoes, telling the cook that she \""had some unhappy campers and they need something else\"".  I had the marlin special which was great but the risotto was just nasty...mushy and not the taste I had expected.  My partner had the pot roast, which was very tender and good but we found that things were very salty.  We started with the trio plate that had hummus which was quite spicy and a great salsa and tomato-based tabbuoli.  We have to share that the worst part of our dining experience was watching and listening to the constant bing of the microwave oven, which is right there for all to see in the little serving window.  Really???  Why are you nuking things before serving?  We watched a pasta dish get zapped for several minutes, taken out, stirred, and slapped back in for another minute or so.",230,1
"Was among my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Came in from AZ to get my favorite food, looked forward to a chicken plate the whole drive, got in late, and arrived 10min before closing.

"how do i say this without sounding too bitter...?  shitty atmosphere, shitty door men, shitty staff, shitty drinks!!!  \n\nmy friends and i had dinner at the restaurant, allowing us to get in to the club for free.  when stamped a 2nd time in line, one friend's stamp was barely noticeable.  rather then let her through the next door guy rudely tells her to get back in line.  she says *but the other guy stamped me, just not that hard.*  dude continues to fluff his feathers and yell at us to get back in line, so off we go (we weren't even drunk or obnoxious to warrant that kind of treatment!!!).  the original guy also gives big attitude as he stamps us again.  don't bother asking any of them questions as you'll get attitude and breeze. \n\nthe club itself is done in a beautiful asian theme, and the dance floor is HUGE, but not when you have a bajillion people stuffed into the place like chickens ready for KFC.  drunk patrons push and shove their way past you to get from here to there, drinks splash all over your arm as people sway around you, and your cute pedi gets demolished from so many shoes stepping on your toes.  drinks are of course $14+ and watered down.  $9 for a bottled corona.\n\ni'd maybe, maybe try again but definitely get a booth next time...",301,1

Pet Paradise is hands down the best dog boarding facility in Charlotte. I leave my pups there with full confidence that they are being cared for and attended to properly. The staff is wonderful and the facilities are kept clean. The outdoors area has doggy bags for your pups and is kept clean.

It is very close to the airport for out of town visitors. Pet Paradise deserves 5 stars!,114,4
"I usually would give 4 stars to Wendy's as I always find their food quality good, service acceptable, and I have a \""free frosty\"" keychain. However, this Wendy's has more restrictive hours than most other Wendy's. They are not open until 9 am, while my experience with other Wendy's has been that they are often open at 6 or 7 am. Since this is located smack in the middle of Tempe's ASU area, I would expect that they open at least by 8 am as there is a ton of demand for fast food in that general area.",125,2

"Big fan if the wings but with this Hooters, the Hooters in Savannah, Ga and Honolulu, Hi when I take my wife with me we get below avg service. It's like the girls see me with another women and just assume I don't deserve decent service from them. It takes well over 10min before someone ask if we want any drinks, then if we're lucky we get at least one refill after our cups have been empty for half an hr. We place our orders and after we are served we won't see our waitress till it's time for the check.

"Have you ever woken up in the morning and said, \""Gee, self, I sure do wish there was a place I could swing by for a good old-fashioned Scottish meat pie, or maybe some shaved roast beef with mac-and-cheese on top, and finish it all off with a chocolate-chip-oatmeal-toffee ice cream sandwich.\"" Have you ever been on your afternoon stroll, taking a break from work, and thought, \""Oh, gee, self, if only we were in Edinburgh, we could stop in one of those quaint little shops and grab a deep fried Mars bar...\""\n\nNo?

Even though there was an assembly line set up, the food we ordered took 10 minutes to cook and we didn't know if they were going to bring the food to us or if we had to pick it up because there are no waiters and there were no numbers being given for each meal....

"With 1,284 reviews on McCarran International Airport, there is a great chance this review will be buried like a gambler in the desert. Hopefully it will be accessable in the next couple of days. With that said here is review 1,285 on McCarran International Airport (from this point foward referred to as McCarran).\n\n   Airports are very important. Besides their primary purpose of serving air travelers, they are a gateway to the city. Airports give travelers their first and last impression of the city. They are a reflection of the city.\n\n  McCarran is a first- rate gateway to Las Vegas. Going back to the 90s, when I flew between McCarran and New York airports, it left me with a positive first and last impression of Las Vegas. It is a reflection of the good things about Las Vegas. It is upbeat. Coming off a long flight, there is nothing more cheerful than hearing the bells of the one-arm bandits. To this day it is a welcoming sound after ending a vacation. Like Las Vegas, McCarran is modern. The monorail between terminals is one of the first to be used at an airport. Recently McCarran replaced the international terminal with a brand new state-of-the-art facility. Like Las Vegas, McCarran features plenty of fast food restaurants and Starbuck's. The list of fast food restaurants keep growing. As far as Starbuck's, they are at the majority of the terminals and even outside security at baggage claim. Just like Las Vegas McCarran is crowded with long lines that move efficiently. And just like Las Vegas, I am a fan of McCarran.",349,3

I get up and have to flag down some other server for my iced tea and ask for our bread.  \""I'll check\"" he says.\nA few mins later HE brings the bread, not our waitress.  \nThen she comes by \""oh sorry, they were baking it\"" - BS., I could see other tables being brought bread all the time.\n5 more mins go by and she then comes back for our order.  2 entrees and a salad.\nMy salad comes a few mins later with the tiniest portion of dressing on the side.

"I understand that being inside an airport, prices are inflated for the convenience, but you should at least get food with similar quality you'd get from the other locations.  The Famous Star burger I received from these guys was a joke!  It's like they just nuked the whole burger including the veggies. So what I unwrapped was this dry overcooked patty dripping with warm mayo and ketchup with soggy wet veggies.  C'mon, now!  For the record, I have been here before and ordered a Breakfast Burger and that one turned out okay.  Apparently they don't know how properly stack veggies in their burgers here, so if you do decide to come here, stick to ordering any sandwich that doesn't have veggies, and you''ll be okay.",160,1
"This review is based on staying in the Tower Suite and does not reflect standard rooms.\n\nPROS: The room: LARGE ROOM, living room, huge super comfy bed, table with chairs, desk, flat-screen TV, double-door entry, large window, two bathrooms (his and hers). The hotel: Nice hotel in a good location on the strip. Plenty of restaurants, bars, and even a 24 hour Starbucks. \n\nCONS: The room: The TV was fairly small with not so great speakers. The hotel: Nice hotel, but don't expect a super awesome \""Pirate Theme\""; some parts of the casino have a Pirate vibe to it, but not as extravagant as you would hope for. Although there are quite a few bars, this is one of the only major resorts on the strip with no night-club. If clubbing is your thing, expect to walk a little ways to another resort for that club experience. Upon check-in, definitely take advantage of the complimentary valet parking. If you self-park, you will have to walk a very long way through the casino to get to the front-desk. \n\nOVERALL: I would stay here again when they run the \""buy one night get one free\"" again, although there are other resorts on the strip that I like much more that I would stay at, unless TI has a great special on rooms again.",292,3

"It seems you only get base model features for a luxury price at Rudy's. \n\nRudy's Burritos does NOT live up to its hype! These overinflated ratings are proof that the far East Valley is still yearning for a quality Southern-California style burrito joint to deliver great border-town Mexican fancy and spiced-up comfort food at a price that's reasonable. Unfortunately, Rudy's does not succeed in the eyes (and mouth) of this experienced burrito-shack groupie. \n\nI walked into this small eatery with high hopes. I love all shapes and sizes of Mexican food establishments, from hole-in-the-walls to name-brand franchises to street-side food carts. Nothing gets me more excited than a lonely burrito shop squeezed into the obscure corner of a strip mall. On the outside, Rudy's had everything going for it...a basic store front, minimal signage, and a small patio with only a couple tables and some wobbly, weather-worn chairs. Definitely one of my favorite sights! \n\nHowever, I was thrust back into the world of the mundane once I encountered the unenthusiastic staff of 2 women running the place the night I went. Both women failed to greet my party, even when it was our turn at the counter to order, and with only 1 person ahead of us, who herself had ordered just 1 burrito and a handful of street tacos \""to go\"", it managed to take the elder of the 2 employees (the only one actually cooking) nearly 20 minutes to serve the first customer and start preparing our food. Thankfully, we were not in a hurry!\n\nWhile I didn't go in expecting anything life changing, I did hope for more than the bland, boiled shredded beef and sparsely \""filled\"" burritos and tacos we received.  I was also charged for guacamole that they couldn't provide and they refused to give me a refund, even though it was only 50 cents!  Ultimately, there wasn't enough uniqueness at the heart of any of the dishes we tried to make them memorable and the prices felt completely unjustified.  I'm happy to spend double what we spent here on a good quality burrito, so believe me when I say the \""comida\"" is not worth the cost!  Between the food, the prices and the (lack of) service, I felt completely cheated out of the unique food experience that I had hoped for. \n\nIn the end, the food was average, the delivery was plain, the atmosphere was nearly hostile and both the d\u00e9cor and service were less than flattering.

"I love the MGM Grand Hotel!\n\nHere are the reasons why:\n\n1.  The standard rooms are large enough for me and my friends to pre-party in.  \n     a.  The bathroom had just one basin instead of two--my preference as this arrangement provides more counter space.  \n     b.  The blinds completely block out any sunlight which allows me to sleep-in undisturbed.  \n     c.  While most other large casinos on the strip have long hallways and you may get stuck with a room at the far end of a long hallway.  MGM's layout has about 6 hallways that radiate outwards from the elevators.  With more hallways, the hallways are shorter and the walks are shorter.\n\n2.  The casino is busy with gamblers earlier in the morning than others on the strip.  While at Caesar's, Cosmo, etc, the crap tables are usually dead at 11am.  It is common to find a couple crap tables full with players during the mid-mornings.\n\n3.  Even at night, the crap table minimum bets are low.  Most of the MGM crap tables had a minimum bet of $10; by contrast, other strip casinos would have only one $10 (it is common to have $15 minimum on the strip and no $10 tables) crap table going...\n\n4.  They have a decent pool party--Wet Republic.  WR is overrated but is still a good pool party.\n\n5.  There are lots of dining options at MGM.  While they are tons of better options in Vegas.  Within the hotel itself, the food selection is quite diverse--there are 15 - 18 different eateries to choose from.\n\n6.  The casino is near the airport.  You can see the runway from the hotel room.  By taxi, the airport is less than 10 minutes away.  I usually get a rental, and there is a gas station at the corner of MGM so I can fill up my tank there and head to the rent-a-car center...\n\n7.  The MGM arena is a great venue for concerts!  Large arena with possibly the best acoustic system on the Strip and a very large display screen behind the stage.\n\nWhile not a perfect hotel, it has enough positive points to make me want to return and stay here....",514,3
"I love this hotel! I've been staying at the Clarendon exclusively for the past 5+ years every time I work in the Phoenix area. Whenever I DJ at parties out here I always insist the promoters book me here at the Clarendon. I love the fact that this hotel is an old apartment building that looks like it was built in the 1960's, the retro decadent look is so cool. The swimming pool and jacuzzi are definitely the highlight here especially in the evening when the bottom of the pool is sparkling with fiber optic lighting. Every year I visit here the hotel is changing and improving it's look and amenities. I'm looking forward to the newly remodeled rooftop with plush seating and bar and a wonderful view of the city skyline",154,4
"My work crew and I have ordered take out from Zinburger several times now. The burgers are great but undercooked every time we order. We have now learned that you need to order medium well in the hopes of getting a medium to medium rare burger. One of the girls I work with orders well done and still has pink in her burger. Great ideas and flavors on the burgers and fries, but they really need to learn to cook them properly.",91,2

"This is probably the only thing that hacks me about The Wynn. I'm not a fan of buffets. Mostly because you never know who's dirty little kid stuck their fingers in the mashies, or how long the food has been sitting out. That being said, I've had my share of buffet experiences in Vegas and I actually prefer the Planet Hollywood one to this spot. \nI felt the selection was lacking, service was slow, and the price just really didn't match up with the amount of sub-par food I was able to consume. \nWas it the worst? Nah, but I won't be returning.",134,1

"I sat at the bar -right next to the fantastic fireplace. I had a cheeseburger with bacon, and a couple blue moons. The burger was fantastic- smoky flavor from the wood fire grill, crisp lettuce, onions, and tomato. Beer was very cold -and delicious...

"So many raving reviews that we just had to check it out. We arrived at around lunch time (12:30 pm) and the line was super long.  We waited about 15 minutes in line to place our orders.  They had a decent size menu with a variety of choices.  The price was very affordable at $5.99 for a hot sandwich or wrap.  Their service can be improved because the cashier was definitely not helpful. But at least the food came out fast and fresh. \n\nHawaiian BBQ: If you like ham and pineapple this is definitely a top choice.  The bread was perfectly toasted like a panini and the BBQ flavor was sweet and flavorful.  \n\nThe Full Montagu: Roasted beef, turkey, Swiss and cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomato, and Earl's mustard. This one tasted like a classic sandwich.  It was hot, fresh, and of great quality.  It wasn't greasy, but delicious.  However, it doesn't have the unique flavors of the Hawaiian BBQ.\n\nOverall: Probably the cheapest, yummiest, and most convenient food spots in Vegas!",242,4

"AMAZING!\n\nI am not shy about my love of museums, and this one was spectacular! The history, the education, the sights, the displays, and all the wonder one can handle; truly a beautiful place to visit and experience.  If you find yourself in Edinburgh, make sure to put this on your list of destinations ...\n\n... AND ...\n\nBring the kids!  They have a really amazing Arts & Crafts Center which is great fun for kids and adults alike. There were five of us when I visited this museum and two of them were children, but I think the three adults may actually have had more fun than the children with the craft making ;-)\n\nThey have some really great displays and interactive experiences, a fabulous little caf\u00e9, and a lot of very friendly, welcoming Docents who are brimming with stories and knowledge.\n\nTruly a beautiful place.",193,4
"Egh...maybe double egh...my GF suggested this place and she arrived a good twenty minutes before I did and was better prepared to place an order. I'm guessing that's why her meal was better than mine although not by much. Enough chit chat let me get to it.\n\nMy GF was upset I was 20 minutes late. So I didn't spend too long studying the menu. I saw seafood combo and ordered that without reading everything was battered and fried. In fact there was more batter on my seafood than seafood itself. So disappointing... As I was sitting there being read the riot act for being late I saw a second menu board with more options to choose from. \n\nWhen you walk in look right as it appears the good food/typical Asian fare is listed over there and you want to make a fully educated choice.\n\nThe girlfriend ordered a BBQ chicken dish. It had good flavor and portion size. She was kind enough to share a bite or two with me when she realized mine was all batter/ breading. \n\nThey have seating for about 15 or 20 people but I think they really don't want you to stay. We ordered at the counter, said we were going to stay and had a seat. Our meals came out in ten minutes served to us in Styrofoam take out containers with plastic forks? No plates or silverware...definitely not a good first impression that was followed up by an equally poor 2nd impression when my seafood combo came out with 75% bread.\n\nI wasn't expecting the Ritz going into a restaurant located in a strip mall but was still sorely disappointed with their food, their service, and overall ambiance. \n\nThe GF said their was no way we'd be back and I'd have to agree.",383,1
"The search for the burgh's best burger continues.... \n\nWhole wheat bun. Check! \n\nHormone free beef = semi healthy??? (I know, not really). Check! \n\nKona Crust seasoning (a little kiss of wood grilled goodness).Check! \n\nGauc, tomato, lettuce, buffalo chedder, ketchup. Check and Check! \n\nThis has all the makings to be a great match for my love affair of burgers to continue.  It doesn't quite beat Wingharts life changing burgers, but it comes pretty darn close!  The mix of sweet and regular potato chips really topped off the whole meal.  I was VERY tempted to try a boozy milkshake, but being the middle of a work day, I decided to be good (for once!). \n\nThe place is really fun inside.  It's very cozy for a rainy (or snowy, sleety, whatever mix of gross) weather you might find yourself in.  It's also going to be great for the summer because they have an open air side of the restaurant that they'll finally be able to open up!  Service was friendly and very fast for someone who could have eaten part of the seat cushions (maybe...not really) at that point from being so hungrg!  It was a great choice for a starving girl. \n\nIs it weird of me that I sorta kinda wished it was in the city instead of in the boonies??

We went in and found out you can sit yourself wherever you like. Waiters and bar tenders were nice, we ordered our food, and we had a good time with the music too.\n\nThey do have a dance floor, but never seen anyone use it maybe they do late at night.

The large size was enough so that we had a few pieces for leftovers.  Washed down with a couple of Blue Moons, it was a nice dinner.",125,3

"Great hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese joint. They serve all the standard fare, pho, split rice, vermicelli. I usually get the split rice dish with pork and at 8.95 the portion is very large. The only thing I've been slightly disappointed with at Tram's is the spring rolls. They weren't as fresh as I was hoping and some of the produce was slightly wilted. \n\nIt seems to be a family owned place, the service is quick, and the food comes out even quicker.",114,3
"Been there three times hoping its going to get better.\n\nHere is the lowdown...\n1st time I went I was told they had a game that was my favorite, when I got there they didnt have it.

Some of my friends had a booth and were playing playstation or some shit that we could all play at home and they were being charged per person at the booth. Since I had not came with them and I ordered al my drinks from the bar, and never even played the game...they still tried to charge my friend for an extra person because I was over there talking to them...\n\nThe concept is great, lacks management and seems like a free for all with the service and they way they treat people there.\n\nI will never step foot in there again. would rather go to pinball museum.",184,0
"I rarely review places to eat unless it's amazing or terrible. Sadly, this was a TERRIBLE spot. The service is hands down the worst in Las Vegas. Food was mediocre and the environment was laughable. \n\nOur waiter couldn't speak English, didn't understand English, and simply made our experience unbearable. 90% of the time our waitress was actually on her phone and ignored our request for service. She was very short when we asked her questions about the menu items, looked annoyed when we did order anything, and it seemed like she would toss our food in front of us when she \""served\"" it. I tend to give people credit, especially since I've worked in the service industry, but I couldn't ignore such God awful service. \n\nThe food was edible. That's all I could really say about it. We paid for AYCE and in all honesty, 50% of the food looked disgusting.\n\nNow what definitely put this place at the bottom of the garbage heap is the actual environment. The booths look like they were recycled from the restaurant that vacated this location previously. There's a random office cubicle near the kitchen and bathroom. And there's shipping boxes stacked up all around the restaurant. \n\nIf you're one of those people who just read the conclusion, READ THIS: AVOID THIS RESTAURANT AT EVERY COST. You'll be disappointed by the food, angered by the service, and questioning why this sushi place hasn't folded yet.",318,0

You can't fail with anything on the menu, and with most items, the portions are plentiful. \n\nTheir calamari is way way better than it should be-- very fresh and not chewy. Love the lamb lollipops. The fries are high class and irresistible. Mac and cheese is a winner along with the ribs and chicken wings. \n\nThis place is noisy downstairs in the evenings, but that works fine with the great energy here. \n\nHalf price wine bottles on Tuesday. Just sayin'.",121,3
"Michael is the best criminal defense lawyer!!!!!! I hired him because I was being charged with 3 criminal misdemeanors. I interviewed about 10 different lawyers, before deciding on Michael. I have a clean record and wanted to keep it that way.To make a long story short, I left my dog and my sis 2 Dog's in a covered parking garage at the airport at 8AM on a cloudy day for a short period of time w the windows cracked. Yes, I made a poor judgement call. I know. If anyone has ever dealt with airport police then you can only imagine my worst nightmare! The dog's were completely fine. Due to all the police officers leaving their dogs in cars lately to die, they are extremely  tough with dog laws in Phoenix. Michael fought for me tooth and nail and got everything dismissed! I was a little worried after the first 2 court dates and he wasn't getting back to me in a timely manner and neither was his secretary. I was frustrated there for awhile. Nobody is perfect. He went to court for me on 3 different occasions and only charged me a flat fee. He is very sharp, knowledgable and not cocky at all like a lot of lawyers. I can say that because I was married to a criminal defense lawyer for 7 years and from all the lawyers I called and interviewed. So many lawyers in the Phoenix area are truly shady! Don't be afraid to put your life in his hands! He knows what he's doing.Thanks a million, Michael!!! You deserve 10 stars!",324,4

"This place has the worst customer service ever!!  The store is only open Mon-Fri from 2pm-5pm and they mean 5pm on the dot!!  I arrived there about 3 mins after 5 and as I was walking up, the lady was about to close the door when I attempted to walk in and she stated \""we are closed.\""  I was ready to say screw this place and let my child find some other way to get a cap and gown! I mean really who runs a business 5 days a week and is only open for 3 hours in the middle of the work and school day.  Most students within a 5-10 mile radius don't even get out of school til 3pm and if they play sports or have some other school acitivties going on or working parents it is impossible for them to get there.  I ended up getting what I needed and it took them a whole 5 mins if that not to mention that the lady working the counter made it a point to tell me that they want to go home! As I was walking back to my car 3 other students flew into the parking lot in hopes to catch them but of course they close at 5pm not a min after! I feel bad for the students because they are required by the school to do business with these people and so they feel that they do not need to cater to their customers!! You would think that at this time of the year they would at least extend their hours so that they could accommadate their customers!! I will NEVER use this place again, thank godness my younger child can use my older childs cap and gown to avoid giving them one more cent!",350,0
"Came here with a prix fix menu. First up, free bread and butter. Then shrimp cocktail with three accompanying sauces. Shrimp were plump, fresh, and served at the right temperature. Good start, bad finish. \n\nNext dish was the Del Frisco house salad. Good balance of toppings and delicious dressing - minus the fruit fly. How does an upscale steakhouse allow that to happen? I was pretty embarrassed for them. But I let the manager know and he replaced my salad and treated the table to the infamous VIP martini. Nice recovery. Onto the entree. \n \nOrder the ribeye. Perfect amount of marbling for extra fatty juicy goodness. Pretty good portion too - I couldn't finish my steak. Sides were forgettable. Green beans were fresh but greasy, as were the cheesy potatoes. For dessert I had their cheesecake topped with strawberry sauce. Again nothing unique, but something sweet to finish the meal is always a nice treat. \n\nProbably wouldn't return again as there are plenty of other places in Vegas that are worth trying.",220,2

Be sure to wear headphones, there is one gentleman that frequents this location that moans and groans so loud that you can literally hear him from the other side of the gym, and  management won't do anything about it. Several other members have  approached the gentleman, sometimes getting a little heated. Things can get downright hostile. would you want to work out in this environment? The basketball courts are always full of hi school kids with no court etiquette or common courtesy of any sort. they leave their garbage everywhere, yell and scream like wild animals (im not exaggerating), and for whatever reason they expect whoever else is on the court to get out of the way when they wanna play a game. long story short, don't join la fitness unless you live across the street from one.",270,2

"Because of it's location close to my apartment, Pizzeria Romeo is the Montreal pizza spot that I've been too the most.  It's well located on Mont Royal close to many great water holes on the Plateau.\n\nPlace: Pizzeria Romeo has a sleek, open layout perfect with plenty of tables to accommodate couples or larger parties.  It's first floor location and large street facing windows ,which open during the summer, make for great people watching and a fun spot to grab a summer drink.  In the evenings, it has darker, refined atmosphere that isn't too dressy but a definite step up from a casual pizza spot.  \n\nFood:  An appetizer of bread and a flavorful tomato spread are generally brought out before the meal.  My wife and I generally split one of the varieties of pizza and order a salad to share as well.  The crust of most pizza in Montreal is for a lack of a better description, medium in thickness.  The meats and vegetables used by the cooks are fresh and delicious.  Even though the pizza is tasty, I find myself wishing the pizza was more like Chicago-style deep dish or thinner NY-style.  A bit of nostalgia that my tastebuds just can't seem to get over and that's why it's 3 stars instead of 4.  \n\nPizzeria Romeo also serves chicken, fish, lasagna and some other non-pizza entries.  But I have never tried them.\n\nThey also offer some excellent cocktails, a variety of beers and a decent wine list.\n\nService:  On our visits, we've found the waitstaff to be attentive and well-informed about the menu.  One minor gripe is that even though you order at the table, you must get up to pay at the central register. (Not sure why they can't take your cash or card at the table?)\n\nPrice:  ~$50 for a pizza, salad and two drinks.  The pizza, salad and drinks are all good and it is a very pleasant spot to spend an evening.\n\n\nTip:  Pizzas are $10 after 10pm if you can wait that long to eat dinner.\n\nIs it the best pizza ever?  No.  But if you're looking for a more upscale spot to take a date or the wife out for decent meal, I think they will enjoy Pizzeria Romeo.",514,2

Nice and clean room, only issue is the outdated and torn furniture makes it look tacky but I get it to keep up with the legacy. I called for an extra blanket, and to have my toilet fixed. Was fixed right away. My room was cleaned everyday.  I ate the R and steak during happy hour was good. Ate at the banana leaf that was good. Was it worth what paid for, It purpose was served for me to lay my head at flexible hotel while on my vacation.  Wi-Fi worked, was slow one day I assumed due to maybe an overload of useage.

on vacation in scottsdale - and this place was incredible.  it would stand up against the best restaurants in los angeles.  the place is family style where everybody shares.  you choose a few skewers and some main courses.  can also get some sushi or some noodle appetizers.  we got the miso cod and some sort of beef for the main courses and got a bunch of the skewers which were all incredible.  the flavor of everything was just awesome.  portions are tiny.  i can't say enough about this place!,112,4
"We visited on a busy Friday evening.  The place was packed and had great energy.  There was a wait which really didn't matter since we like to sit at the bar so when two seats quickly opened and we sat immediately.  The ambiance is worth five stars alone.  The decor, the open windows and the amazing wine room make this place inviting and attractive.  After ordering the wine and an appetizer (Wood Grilled Artichoke) we waited...and waited...and waited some more.  The bartender noticed how long we waited several times and kept checking with the kitchen.  After about 35 minuets and an apology from the bartender the artichokes we delivered by someone...perhaps a manager with another very forced and dry apology.  The chokes were OK, but not fully cooked but the ailoi was delicious.  As expected  two minutes after the app was dropped our entrees arrived...annoying.  The Grilled Vegetable dish was served with a goat cheese spread and overall was good but not something I'd order again (my fault for ordering).  My husband had the Steak Frites and enjoy it.  \n\nAs soon as the check was dropped the service dropped.  Not once did the bartender ask if we wanted another glass of wine when our glasses sat empty for nearly 30 min nor was there any further contact from any employee.  The best part of the whole experience was when the bartender who wad been serving us that night grabs her purse, clocks out and then sits next to the guy sitting next to us and starts having a conversation.  I guess she didn't care that we hadn't paid yet...she must not be hurting for tips?  I understand food timing issues and that kitchens get backed up sometimes but I don't understand poor service and the lack of recovery from staff and especially the managers.  If something is wrong at a table or the bar, it is the managers responsibility to take action and not ignore it.",407,1
"Small casino - Hopefully they're going to expand, but for now, it seems very small. Drinks here are awful. We ordered bay breeze, pina colada, captain and sprite, and all 3 were disgusting and we didn't feel good afterwards. Cocktail waitresses also go by the book and make certain that you're playing an actual slot machine or sitting on one before they get a drink for you. The crowd here is very lively, rowdy, and young. Seems like the roulette tables were money!! The bar the Quad was the only good thing (near poker table) - They did a lot of awesome tricks and there were performances going on. They were even giving people free shots (for tip of course) directly into their mouths! I'd come here only to watch the bartenders do tricks, but I'm sure there are other better casinos that have tricks & better drinks.",185,1
"Despite being one of the best buffets I have been to and especially in Vegas, there was not too many things for vegetarians although some would say what they have will suffice.  For the price?  Unless you want a lot of dessert, I suggest only go if your meat eating friends want a buffet.  They do have options for us veggie.  If you're a vegan, I would not suggest this place.  There is hardly anything for vegans outside of steam rice or salad.\n\nHere's the thing, if you ask your waiter to help you with vegetarian items, they will actually ask one of the chef to give you a private tour explaining all the food items you could eat.  Funny enough the chef pushed a few seafood items at me, so be aware of that.  I am guessing some of these chefs still think vegetarian means fish and other seafood as well.  Maybe if you go and you are a vegan, they can point things out for you too.  From my tour though, most of the stuff included dairy or eggs.\n\nWould I go back?  Yes.  Only if my friends really want to go.  Will I go back if it was my choice and my choice alone?  Nah.  I rather spend money at a place with more veggie options.\n\nThe best thing: the macaroni and cheese bar!  I got all the veggie with extra jalapenos.  Too bad I cannot eat too much of that cause it was heavy cream and cheese based, but dang was it good!",320,2
"Ok why do I need to go to Las Vegas ( actually Henderson) to get a good New York Pizza? Because there is NO Grimaldi's in Los Angeles! While Deep dish is my FAVORITE style, I do love me a good NYC pie and this is tops. The crust is just perfect, well done, not soggy, with a bit of char on the edges ( the way a good NY should be thanks to a coal oven) the sauce is very tasty, although I would have liked a tad more. You can get extra sauce for $2 which is kind of annoying, just put more sauce on please. My favorite little pepperonis that get all crispy at the edges.  We also ordered the antipasto salad and a house salad, that had an awesome mix of veg, and literally could have fed 8 ( there were 4 of us).  Alas, I have to go back to LA and not -so- great selection of New York style pies. 1 Star off for making me pay for xtra sauce otherwise outstanding!",213,3
"Pretty good ramen, big portions for the price... We liked the pork slices with the tonkatsu broth.  I would recommend skipping the beef slices (lacked flavor and was dry).  I will go back when craving Japanese ramen.",49,2
"The buffet is barely OK. Nice decor and space. Different stations but the only thing I really liked was the teriyaki chicken. Everything else was mediocre. Crab legs, watery; meats, flavorless, and Mexican, horrendous. Service was decent. \nThe damn thing is we had coupons and it was still pricey for a buffet. If you can, I try somewhere else.",78,1
"Awesome place to spend the whole day. You can get massages, hair done, nails, and a facial! Lil pricey for hair color and cut. Massages are great and relaxing. And I never had my nails done there because the lady is always booked. Which doesn't work for me because I have a busy schedule. \n\nJoAnne does the best facials ever! Told her I never had one. When I spoke with he on the phone she said a peel was best for what I wanted as results. Didn't know what to expect. She explained product as well as procedure telling me everything step by step. She was so awesome and had me relaxed. Very great with her hands. Gentle but gets the job done! This was my second facial and from now on I'm definitely going to her! I highly recommend her. She also does  Brazilian waxing. Definitely check her out. You won't be disappointed!",193,4
"....Dear God.\n\nM&M's everywhere.  All over the place.  In every colour.  And every possible combination.  And lots of M&M related gear.  OH MY!\n\nThe place is multiple stories tall, with different merchandise on each floor.  I had M&M overload while looking for a gift for my girlfriend.\n\nOne whole back wall was filled with tubes of M&Ms of only a single colour.  Silver, black, magenta, white....whatever you want, you can get it here.  And pick out your own sack of them.\n\nGranted, they're much more expensive than a local grocery store.  And they taste exactly the freaking same.\n\nBut seriously, you're in Vegas to spend (lose) money...why not do it on a novelty item like this?\n\nKids love this place.  Even at 10:00 at night, the place was slammed.  I mean, really!",214,3
"How many nice restaurants are there in Las Vegas on the strip alone?  A lot.  How many did we eat at?  ZERO!  Thanks to my husband's inability to wait 5 minutes once he's hungry and our friends who would rather spend their cash on beverages, rather than food.\n\nSo Aria's buffet was our Friday night dinner.  With unlimited wine and a lobster for every two people, $36 sounded like a pretty good deal.  Unfortunately, since we never made it back to our hotel room the night before, I was not at my best for eating.\n\nThe buffet had just about everything.  Multiple carving stations that included lamb, turkey, New York steak, pork tenderloin, and prime rib.  I had none of that, so I can't comment other than to say my companions were pleased.  Seafood options included crab legs, shrimp and oysters among other things.  \n\nThe \""free\"" lobster was a mess.  Our order was lost, so there was a long delay, and it was NOT worth the wait.  It was so overcooked, it was like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Minus two stars alone for the senseless slaughter of crustaceans.  If you can't prepare it well enough to at least be edible, don't bother offering it!",282,1
Drove all the way out there because it said it was open on Yelp. Turns out it was closed. No signage saying it was closed for the holiday weekend. Just emptiness.,37,0
"There were lots of empty seats for this show. The lower tier of the theater was full, but the upper tier was more than half empty. If you want to see this show, get your tickets from Tix4Tonight or a similar vendor and don't pay full price! Even if you have to get the tickets the morning of the show (and w/ Tix4Tonight you have to) there will probably be plenty to choose from.\n\nAs for the show, it was fun and entertaining. I didn't know much about the Four Seasons, but did recognize many of the songs. The performers were great and there were some funny comedic moments, but I felt the show ran too long. Or maybe I just got bored. The crowd was mostly older (50+) -- they probably have more of an emotional attachment to the music since they grew up with it. But, most people will enjoy the show regardless of whether or not you know the tunes.\n\n3.5 Stars",206,2

"We were really looking forward to some good Irish grub, unfortunately, it didn't happen here. The Shepherd's Pie \""gravy\"" was watery and tasteless, and there wasn't much meat. The irish stew was cold and and bland. The wait staff was nice, but service was lacking. Everything took a long time, and the most disappointing was dessert. Though the bread pudding was good, we asked for ice cream on it,  and the waitress waited too long to bring it to our table so the ice cream was almost completely melted. Won't be returning.",119,1
"Four for dinner and we had coupons! Good place to use them.\n\nWife and I were astonished at how different, upscale and better this chain is compared to a few years ago when we were customers.  I had a very nice restaurant feel, rather than being in a sports bar or a fast food joint posing as a restaurant.\n\nService very good, great menu, a wine list with decent wines and the food was very good.\n\nCaribbean chicken, petite sirloin and two blackened shrimp/steak combos. All got raves.\n\nA comfortable place for a family or date dinner or lunch.  Fine job, Ruby Tuesday.",136,2
"My friend and I went on a Friday, around 5:30pm, for dinner & drinks before a show at The Smith Center. It wasn't particularly crowed yet and we were seated inside where another group was also enjoying dinner. The hostess (a younger woman) seated us and after about 10 minutes were only greated with glasses of water from a bus boy, no server....nothing. Food was brought to the other patrons (couple different servers) but they were \""in and out\"" so fast neither of us could get their attention.\n\nSo finally after another10-15 minutes, at about 15 minutes with no service at all we went and got our own drinks from the bar outside...I decide to go back to the host/hostess station and ask when our server is going to come and take our order. A young guy with an accent looks genuinely perplexed and walks with me to where we were seated. He had NO idea we'd been put there, the hostess said not a peep to anybody to help us. He seemed truly embarrassed and apologetic and had a female server come to our table immediately. She took our order (we went for the tapas, not bad) and then the male host came back and again apologized, saying that a miscommunication had occurred and the next round of drinks were on the house. He also brought out an appetizer on the house as well. Definitely appreciated the gesture and he promised to put in our food orders ahead of everybody else's as we had a show at 7:00pm. Food came out very quickly, as did the second round of beers. The shift manager, older lady, came over and she also apologized for the mix up and told us that she'd take a further percentage off our final bill. Again, we appreciated that...the attention we received helped to make up for the earlier blunder. I'd read that the service here in earlier posts was very poor but it looks like they make the effort and go the extra mile when mistakes happen...and mistakes are bound to happen!!!\n\nI had the roasted tomato soup (which was especially yummy) mac & cheese, ribs and a pollo something or other. I wasn't terribly \""blown\"" away by the tapas as I've had better in town but would give the entrees a shot next time I'm in the area and want to stop in for a bite. Prices are higher that I felt was appropriate but I guess when you want to eat in the \""Art District\"" that's what you'd expect? If I could give a 2 1/2 star rating that would be more fair but even with the earlier service FAIL and recovery the food wasn't stellar so 2 stars it is.",573,1
Excellent food and margaritas!!,7,4

You are a fool if you like Chinese food and don't go to this place.  BEST CHINESE FOOD in the US.  PERIOD.  You don't come here for the service or ambiance.  This isn't Morton's.  It's Chinese food at its best.  What more do you want?,69,4
"We've been to Hayashi several times now with larger groups and we've always had a good time. We've always sat at the hibatchis  which is fun and lends for an interesting evening.  \n\nWe've been to Benihanas several times and honestly, the food is better at Hayashi. We all had different items and everything was cooked to perfection. Nothing was dried out or under seasoned like you often get at Benihanas. JC was our chef and he was funny, entertaining, and fit right in with our rowdy crowd.\n\nThe only reason why I didn't give this a 5 star rating is that the drink service was SO FREAKING SLOW! Granted, the restaurant was jumping but it was a really long time between refills and I really hate that and its been like that every time I've gone there.",180,3
"i had such high hopes for Tacos El Gordo and i left extremely underwhelmed after my recent late night/early morning meal here :( with such high ratings and raves from friends, i knew that when we were at encore for nighttime festivities that a stop at tacos el gordo was a must! its a short walk from the encore and the strip mall is so brightly lit that you wont miss the place haha. came around 130ish and it was already packed with people! i wasnt feeling too adventurous so i didnt want to try any of the 'crazy' stuff like tongue haha...so i went with one of my all-time fave dishes - carne asada fries ($10)! these fries just didnt live up to the hype and i've definitely had better in OC and SD :( the carne asada tasted bland and the guacamole didnt seem fresh like it just came out of a package. i tried a bite of my friend's adobada taco and did enjoy that better since the spicy pork had more flavor. overall though i just left here disappointed...maybe i should give it another try when im drunker haha",230,1
"No leg room But cheap ticket so I shouldn't complain about that.  The amount that we paid for the bags was rediculos... so the amount I paid for my bads I could have gone with a  lot expensive air line and been more comfortable.

"I heard about this place while researching the best places to go for breakfast in Vegas on Yelp, of course. =D Checked out the website and was impressed that it was on one of Rachel Ray's finds on the Food Network. Looking at the menu made me hungry so my husband and I decided to check it out the next day.\n\nIt was quite busy when we got there around 9:30 am. Plenty of tables and flat screen tvs...We were immediately seated. I was fascinated with the newspaper-printed menu. Quite unusual. Definitely stood out.\n\nI ordered the Waffle Works with bananas, eggs and bacon. My husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. When our orders arrived the first thing we noticed was that the portions were HUGE! To us, one plate was plenty for two.\n\nI was a  bit disappointed with my order. Nothing really impressed me besides the portion. My waffles were overcooked. The eggs didn't have enough seasoning and tasted rubbery. The bacon was okay.\n\nMy husband said that his biscuits were a bit hard to fork through. But, he enjoyed the Works potatoes. Overall our first experience at Egg Works was (sorry to say): Eh.\n\nThe Standouts: Hearty portions, attentive service, unique menu.\n\nWould we come back? Yes. Willing to give it another visit. Next time we'll share a plate and try out the banana nut muffin.",304,2
"Tried this place over the weekend.  The service was Excellent!  The chips and salsa were good. \n\nI had a red chile burrito enchilada style.  With all of the rave reviews of this place I was expecting a lot more, but it was just OK.  It was the same as all the other red burrito's I've ever eaten.  Beans and rice that came with the combo was about the same as any other place I've been to.\n\nBeer was nice and cold, and the service was great!  I'd eat here again, but next time I'll try one of thier specialties.",137,2

"I used to shop at Around The World Market in Durham and Cary and was really happy to find out they were opening a store in Charlotte. They have great selection of brands and products, the store is pretty big and service is good. I always find people to help me with comparing different products and brands. The owner Paresh Bhai is really friendly and funny! This place is a pleasure to shop at, unlike Patel Brothers in Pineville, which is almost like a fish market and is full of rude cashiers who don't really care about their customer base. They also have frozen Halal meat for sale, including minced goat!\nAround the World Market gets brownie points for having a little sugarcane juice machine ($1 per cup), 50 cents for a cup of fresh ginger or masala chai and for playing Radio City live from India!",169,4

"I had such a pleasant week in Vegas and stopping in this place for a last Vegas drink was just a mistake. I've had the shittiest service here ever. It is THAT BAD. \n\nMy boyfriend and I sat at the bar and after a few minutes the bartender asked for his order and didn't bother to ask for mine. She didn't even look at me. As she was preparing his drink, I said loud enough \""I'd like to also order something...I'm with him\"" and she completely ignored me. She was right in front of me! Maybe she wasn't paying attention but hello....I'm in your section siting here and didn't even acknowledge me? Wow! I had to order from a bar back and she had to tell the other bartender at the end of the bar to make my drink. \n\nThe spicy mango Marguerita I ordered tasted like straight syrup. Nasty. \n\nDo yourself a favor and do not come here if this is how you want your last memories of Vegas to be. Absolutely horrible. Thanks for a crappy experience.",233,0
"I was considering five stars. I really was. I've eaten at Lemongrass a few times, and the good is consistently great. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The service on my last visit was absolutely terrible. Brought it down to 3.75 stars, so I'm rounding up.\n\nThe food is beautiful, flavorful, delicious. Particularly recommend the red curry with duck breast and lychee, the crab fried rice, and the drunken noodle with seafood. Seafood central, but so delicious.\n\nThe selection of vegetarian options is scanty, and they don't really reduce the price if you want to sub veggies for the protein.\n\nThe mango and sticky rice is spot on! Temperatures were perfect, the mango was ripe and sweet.\n\nAs far as the service, things were fine at the beginning of the meal, then really started to slow down about halfway through. Then they just straight up screeched to a halt. After we finished eating, we waited over half an hour to get the waiter's attention to request our check. Then another ten minutes to actually get the check. Good thing we didn't have any pressing plans for the evening! No apology or anything. Good thing the food was so great or I'd be writing Lemongrass off my list for good.",275,3
"Zero stars. Difficult to stay even just to see Jason DeVore. Had to beg waitress wearing under panties up her ass to shut off tv over stage(less than a foot from singers head playing death metal). When the chubby chicks started to get up on stripper pole whilst being filmed by their male counterparts I kind of threw up a little in my mouth. All during an acoustic show...This was a display of vulgarity that I didn't sign up for. If I had actually paid the freaking five dollar cover- there would be hell to pay- \nNo thanks WestGate. PS: are the waitresses violating health code w their vj's half exposed while serving customers and being close to soda gun & supplies for service?\n\nI'm adding to this now that I'm home safely....I don't ever remember being at a bar that was, at best, 1/3 full- and nearly every patron was drinking multiple 'shots' bc they're only $1 if you buy a draft. I saw customers swaying and losing their balance, holding onto the table, while ordering 'another round'. By 1am, the crowd was zombie-like and sad to watch- --leaving at 2:05 am was the very worst and most terrifying part of the night. As I maneuvered my way through the drunken herd to the parking lot to retrieve my car- I saw a HUGE line of taxis...that were not going anywhere. The parking lot reminded me of the last day of school, in that, ppl were yelling & honking and sitting on the roofs of cars throwing cans and bottles and trash...there actually was police presence- not in the lot itself but on the street well before the lot. On my 3/4 of a block walk to my car, I saw no police cars, officers or even security. It was, as I said, terrifying. I sat in my car for a bit worrying about the drive.  Thank goodness it was uneventful and I'm here to talk about it this morning. \nAlso one last thing to add, as I read another review posted about 8 hours before my original- the guy said the place was 'really clean'. Well, have another dollar shot my friend. The lights are low for a reason. I would not eat food that was prepared here. \nThe 'stripper pole' by the sofas was being utilized by chicks w short dresses on and that's all I think I need to say...\nThe ladies room: oh dear...2 stalls, 2 small sinks. I arrived around 10 & used restroom then - in the stall I chose, there were 3 handwritten signs that instructed me to hold toilet handle down. At 10pm no seat liners-- but seat liner dispenser on wall directly above toilet. 4 paper towel dispensers but 3 were empty. The floor was disgusting. I took some photos...since I was there 10-2, I visited ladies room a few times and after each, I'd stop an employee on way out of hall to let them know about the paper shortage. Each person I stopped said \""oh ok\"" and followed up by stating something to the effect of 'that's REALLY not my job, but I'll tell someone'. \""Someone\"" never corrected the issue. 2 times in ladies room there was blatant drug use- large stall several ppl in there- chick at sink buying 'Vicodin' from other chick....\nEvery ashtray outside was overflowing w cig butts- \nI personally had 2 $3 rolling rock beers & 2 $2 small water bottles, bc I try to be responsible for my 11 mile drive home. \nMy guess is that this review won't be printed- and I don't usually tear a business up one side and down the other- my reviews are generally positive. I am writing this waytoolong review bc I read some really good tips & reviews and am almost in disbelief that this is the same place.",832,0
"\""Where everybody knows your name\""\nLoooove this place. As a local CA transplant, it was refreshing to find our new local hangout, where the staff is personable and attentive. The food is amazing, and the beer list spectacular. Every time we've been since moving to town, all the fab bartenders were sure to get our names, and greet us every time. Hubby loves the Kobe burger. I love the wings and fries! Haven't had a bad meal here, yet! And their machines are great! Definitely worth visiting! We are on our way in a few ;)",123,4
"Ugh this location is so frustrating. It's the only one on my long commute to work that's easy to get to. It's always busy but not for the right reasons. I can only speak for the drive thru but it seems as though there's only one person running the register and making the drinks. The other 5 employees are standing around. Guess that's why I never see the same person at the window for too long. They must hate being the only one who works and eventually quits. \n\n3 times out of 5 my drink is wrong. For some reason they can't get a regular mocha and a white mocha straight. For me, Starbucks is a treat. I budget for one or two stops each month. So, I look forward to it. Unfortunately I haven't leaned I need to budget more time for it too because I can't usually wait for them to remake my drink. \n\nTerrible customer service too.",203,1
"The food is very good, but the service leaves MUCH to be desired. I visited with six family members on my birthday a few weeks ago. We waited about 45 minutes for a table to open up, but I figured it was so there would be a table to accommodate my grandmother, who was in a wheelchair. Eventually, the ma\u00eetre d' called our name, and we went to our table to find that my grandmother's wheelchair would not fit. I snuck away to go to the bathroom, and I returned to find that the ma\u00eetre d' split our group into four and two, putting my grandmother and grandfather at a table about twenty feet away from where the rest of my family was seated.\n\nI ordered the pancakes, which were not only excellent, but about ten minutes later than everyone else's food. We asked a waitress where my pancakes were, she offered a flustered explanation that many people order the pancakes, which made it difficult to keep track of where they all go. (Perhaps I should be surprised that the rest of my family received their orders, since everybody ordered hotcakes.) \n\nAnother five minutes passed, and the pancakes finally showed up. They were a bit more buttery than I like, but they still retained a light, fluffy flavor. (I should mention that as a person who lives about thirty minutes from the Vermont border, I'm slightly let down when restaurants have table syrup instead of maple syrup. Pamela's hotcakes aren't worthy of ordinary table syrup, so the lack of maple syrup was more disappointing than usual.) However, I only was able to eat half of my order because I was so stressed out about the poor service.\n\nLater, I spoke to a manager who was working in the kitchen. He was very nice and very apologetic about what happened. However, the ma\u00eetre d' came back and started to try and defend himself, saying that he offered to split us up and that we accepted. I replied that he not only waited until we arrived at our table, but that he let in many groups of two and four (and even five) that had arrived after we did. The manager apologized and explained that this ma\u00eetre d' was new to the restaurant, and later gave us $25 in gift cards, which I'm not sure I will use. On the way out, the ma\u00eetre d' gave me a quick \""take it easy, bro\"" response. I kept myself from yelling at him and left, probably for the last time. Until service improves and handicap-accessible seating is improved, I cannot see myself returning to Pamela's.",568,1
"What a bummer. I came for lunch, and ordered a Hot Hero for something like 7.99. When a tiny sandwich, on a big plate found it's way to my table, I couldn't help but giggle. A little roll, with sauce, a couple slices of sausage, and some cheese. Taste wise, I give this thing a 2.5 out of 5. Portion wise.. a 2.. Service was service. Our waiter had no personality. I am curious about the dinner entrees, cuz that shit did sound amazing. Lunch was wack as f*** tho. I don't want to detour you from eating here, cuz I imagine the dinner is probably decent, based on other reviews I have read. Just don't get a sandwich.",162,1
"Through its wooden latticed windows you'll often find flickering candles, couples chatting away and if you really squash your nose up against the window you'll see that the foods aesthetically pleasing too.  The wines in here are exceptional including a memorable Rioja and a deep, rich Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.  Dishes include a scrumptious platter of freshly baked breads accompanied by balsamic and olive oil dip. There's an equally tempting sweet potato and chorizo risotto that is easily complimented by the above wines. Prices are affordable and the staff strike the right balance of chattiness and attentiveness. Perfect for a date.",126,4
"Went here the other day and here is my opinion on the place.\n\nMaybe because it was their soft opening, it was kinda all over the place but:\n\nThe place is small but nice, easy to ready menu and lots of options(Soft opening so not all were available)\n\nThe Sisig which I normally am a big fan of was hard. Not crispy like I've had before but HARD. not pleasant to eat but did have alot of flavor.\n\nAdobo was good but missing a little flavor to be honest. Had it in tacos form and on my bowl.\n\nWe were charged extra for some reason. The garlic rice was .50  extra and that was fine but that didn't explain the extra $3 charge  and on our receipt as the order was cut off where it showed the items. Didn't want to wait in line to go back and argue since we had already waited 10 min.\n\nThe kitchen staff and front were completely all over the place and no one was really focused on the customer. Waited in line for 10 min before even ordering. They were yelling at each other back and forth and the guy kept yelling at the cashier though she seemed as if she just started but instead of yelling, he could have explained it to her in a calm way...\n\nReceived food and we were missing some tacos. They did quickly give them to us but it seemed everyone who went here had to go back since they were missing an item so CHECK YOUR ORDER!!\n\nI will try again as maybe they were having issues with it barely being open but so far unimpressed :/... Was super excited after having great food and service at their food truck.",362,1
"Hot n juicy what? Crab corner who?  That's what u will be asking yourself after tasting Lola's crawfish. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned\n\nSo after we went zip lining at Freemont Street this afternoon, we were HONGRY...As we pass by a sign indicating that Lola's have Louisiana Style boiled crawfish, Friday and Saturday, I quickly yelped Lola's. Called and learned that 200lbs of live crawfish is flown in to be boiled for perfection. Sounds good to us so we made a U-turn.  \n\nWhen we walked into this little restaurant, we immediately feel as if though we were somewhere in Louisiana.  The decor was mardi gras-ish.  We looked at the menu and saw that 5lbs of crawfish, w/potato and corn for $41.99.  That sounds pretty awesome but we played it safe and ordered 1lb to see if it meets our expectation prior to going for the big bang.  After 5 mins or so, our 1lb of crawfish along with a corn on the cob and a cute little potato came out.  We each grabbed a crawfish...it smelled right...snap off the tail and peeled off the shell, took a bite and WOW.  The meat was tender and juicy, was seasoned perfectly.  They were not drenched in oil and/or butter like the competition.  No need for any condiment.  Lola made it right.  We then quickly flagged our waiter down and politely asked if we may take advantage of the 5lbs deal by adding another 4lbs to the order.  He asked Lola and she was so awesome to allow it.  10 mins later, Lola brought out the 4lbs of crawfish to us herself.  She is such a wonderful and funny lady owner.  And, best of all, she knows how to make delicious crawfish.  \n\nWe also ordered a dozen wings with fries.  We liked them naked fried so we asked the waiter beforehand if they were battered fried or naked fried.  He responded that they are naked fried.  WRONG!  They came out battered fried.  BOOOOOO.  But the flavor was there so we let it go.  We learned that our waiter has only been there for 2 weeks so it's ok.  The crawfish was so tasty that it didn't matter.\n\nTo end this wonderful lunch at Lola's, we   ordered the bread pudding.  It was warm and moist, with a hint of Mr. Jim Bean secret concoction.  YUM.\n\nIt has been hard for us to find a place that makes crawfish like how we remembered it to be in the South.  All the other items on the menu looks delicious, but we can't find ourselves ordering anything other than crawfish!  As soon as crawfish season is over, we will delve into the other menu items, like the red bean and rice, jambalaya, and so many more...\n\nIf you love crawfish, this place is a must. You will not be disappointed.",659,4
"You walk in and immediately think you've entered an Elks lodge.  The food is solid but I'm not sure it is good or unique enough to pull you away from the gravitational pull of the two superior Italian delis in the area, Defalco and Andreoli.  Also, that 'Cash Only'  policy isn't earning any customer service awards.",77,2
"We ate at Beso during our recent trip to Las Vegas.  We thought it would be a good experience based on the menu and the ambiance.  We were very disappointed.  The restaurant is loud and unimpressive compared to similarly priced restaurants in Las Vegas.  The pictures on the Beso website make the restaurant appear much nicer than it actually is.  It took our waiter more than 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order, and it took about 15 minutes after he took the order for him to return with our drinks in hand.  After all of that waiting, two of the drinks were wrong and he forgot one of the drinks.  Our food was mediocre and too busy with spices and garnishes.  Our waiter did not pay any more attention to our table after our meals were served and we had to ask another waiter for refills on our drinks.  The experience was not a good one and certainly not worth the money.  We could have had a better meal and better service elsewhere.  We won't return to Beso and we recommend that you spend your time and money elsewhere too.",231,0
I made the mistake of revisiting 1130 for lunch yesterday and immediately regretted it.\n\nBloody Marys were on special so we ordered up a round.  Big mistake.  They were chunky and revolting - mine went back.  I ordered the turkey burger and my companion had the salmon sandwich.  After a wait that was infinitely too long we received our rather sad looking meals.  My turkey burger came completely dry and solo on a squished and soggy bun.  It was obviously a frozen patty and not from a reputable brand either.  My fries were even worse as they were both undercooked and greasy at the same time.  My companion's salmon sandwich was overcooked and served with rancid looking lettuce.  Not a good way to earn our favor.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.,177,0

"We tried the teriyaki chicken and Asian spicy chicken. Both were very good!  If this was located a little closer to us, we'd definitely come back on a regular basis. Wide variety to choose from on the menu including crab puffs, edamame, etc. If I could rate 4.5 I would - the only downside is that it's small inside so not the most welcoming place to eat, but if you want something delicious on the go, this is it.",101,4

"Why are almost all the movie theater in this town located in casinos?\n\nOh, well, not to worry, since this once is strategically located so that you walk in from the parking garage and don't have to traipse through an entire hotel, just a food court, which is pleasant window shopping for us fatties.\n\nThe theater itself is clean and well maintained, and while we didn't go on a Monday, the matinee prices were still noticeably lower than most.\n\nUnfortunately, the concession prices are not.\n\nWe were here because I had promised Little Guy an an after-school outing if he could go an entire week without showing up on the Most Wanted List at school. Imagine my surprise when the little bugger actually did it! So how could I turn down his request for popcorn even though I had smuggled my usual contraband Snickers, Kit Kats and Reese's in my purse?  \n\nI bought it, but it hurt.  Especially when I found out a few days later that he was just concealing his latest transgressions from me.\n\n\nI have no idea where he gets his criminal proclivities from.",249,2

"Everyone deserves a second chance, despite my previous review/comment about second chances at such exorbitant prices.\n\nI get it...I really do. The fancy dining sofa's, ass kissing service and iron skillets. It's all good. But what's the use of iron skillets if they don't provide heat? My $60 filet was cold...once again. I hate sending food back. I won't do it. I shouldn't have to.\n\nSorry, I got ahead of myself. I jumped to the main course.\n\nThe bread is very good. That particular iron skillet delivered. I'm reluctant to Yelp anything is good in a sentence because that may become a YELP restaurant highlight.\n\nCraftSteak's beet salad is bland. I don't necessarily like salty food, so that says a lot. Maybe add a chunk of goat cheese. Not daring to be different, but it's a classic pairing. But hey, beets are good for me, so I'll move on...\n\nThe risotto was good, with all the tomatoes, bits and pieces, but was served CRUNCHY al dente. \n\nThe filet...well you know about my filet. Other than it being coldededed, it was, yes, under seasoned and BLAND. Try a Ruth's Chris steak, so hot, moist and buttery.\n\nOh, oh, oh....my Dark and Stormy, ginger and rum drink was great.\n\nThe service was very good, but I sat at the bar. That's my thing when I want great service. That's a no brainer.\n\nNo dessert tonight, even though the Monkey Bread is fan-fuckin-tastic! YELP highlight that!\n\nLucky to be alone tonight. Only $146 for one.",398,1
"If I were to rate *only* the food then I would have given a 5-star rating since I find the food really good. But its not only the food that makes you come back or appreciate a place.\n\nThe service of this place is very poor. I believe the servers should be given some training on how to interact with guests, how to behave with them, how to serve them. But no, the owner doesn't care about it. It happens with me all the time, the servers \""hands-me\"" the plates, bowls, curries, breads everytime without fail, insteading of keeping it on the table even when I am in the middle of my meal. \n\nAnd the most irritating thing, they always ask you to pay while you are eating. ALWAYS! Why can't they wait for me to finish and then let me ask for the cheque or if it can't be avoided, why can't they be courteous while asking for it. Last time when I went there, the same thing happened and instead of complying, I complained, asked the server that I wanted to speak to the manager. This really spoils *the* experience for me.\n\nI keep going back to this place since it is walking distance from my place, but after the last time, never going back!",276,0
This place is great and the service is excellent. I had the falafel and hummus and hubby had the schwarma plate..both are excellent. The ambience is quaint and the server was so friendly and warm. I would go back again in a heart beat and will tell all that visit Vegas to try this place out.,65,4
"I travel to Vegas regularly for work. I've developed a taste for smaller locals casinos off the strip because it allows me to focus on work and save some money. \n\nI stayed here a couple months ago for 2 nights and won't be going back because I had a bad experience at the buffet.\n\nOne morning, prior to the buffet opening we stood in line. There were two long lines each going out either side. There was a handicap sign on the side that I was standing in but nobody standing in line was handicapped, and I asked the people behind me if I was in the wrong line. They were tourists, and were just as unsure as I was.\n\nAfter about 20-25 minutes in line I get to the front and the (heavy set black) lady says the line is for VIP and disabled people only. She refused to let me pay and said we had to go to the back of the other line.\n\nWe walk away to the other line and wait expecting to see the middle aged (white) couple be sent back to this line too. But surprisingly I don't see them making the same trek that I did.\n\nNow I'm furious and I walk up and I call her out on it. I say hey, why did you send us to the back of the line but let the other couple go?\n\nShe claimed they had a disabled veterans card unaware that I had chatted with them in line, and discovered that they were tourists from Utah, and they too did not know which line to stand in.\n\nI walked away appalled and pissed off. This was absolutely the worst experience I've ever had in Vegas. \n\nIt's been a couple months but that experience still lingers.\n\nI regret not going  to her manager that same morning and filing a complaint. We ended up not eating there as it was a work morning and we were now running late. We got food to go at the cafe that took a while next door and of course they forgot to add stuff to our order as well.\n\nWould I recommend this place? \n\nEek! Methinks not.",459,0

"One star is really pushing it.\n\nKRISTINA was our server's name and she was as terrible as they come. I only got her name because I actually saved our receipt with her name on it. Let's just get right into it.\n\n*I am a server too and I STILL am sooo upset about this experience. \n\nI came with the boyfriend to grab brunch yesterday afternoon because I heard they do amazing red velvet pancakes. We went to the hostess and they were polite, told us it would be a 15 minutes for inside and 20 for outside. We said we'd take first available. \n\nWe got seated sooner than expected outside on the patio (which is beautiful by the way; the only reason why this restaurant should even receive any stars). We had some time to look at the menu prior to getting seated so we knew what we wanted. Kristina came by about 5-10 after we had been seated, we ordered water,oj and coffee for the each of us. We also put in the order of the red velvet pancakes and and sriracha fried chicken. \n\nThen we waited....\n\nIt took about 5-7 minutes for our drinks. No biggie, she's busy. No sugar caddy for our coffee. We wait to catch her. We don't see her. No biggie, my boyfriend just goes all the way to front of the restaurant to grab some. \n\nOur coffees go empty but it's ok since we ordered OJ as well so we have something else to drink. Our food finally comes; served to us by a different server of course. We have no utensils. Awesome.  The guy who brought our food was so kind to bring us some.\n\nThe pancakes were good, nothing that special. Boyfriend's chicken had obviously been sitting at the window forever since his sriracha sauce was dried up on his place and his cole slaw was warm. Whatever we don't complain, it's fine. Up to this point we STILL haven't seen Kristina anywhere. \n\nShe finally appears when we're about half way through and asks how the food is, we say it's fine and she disappears again. \n\nWe're done with the food and we just want to get out of there now but of course our server is no where to be found. We see another server bussing a table and politely ask if we could get our check from our server since we had been waiting sometime now. This server was so apologetic and mentioned that everyone was quite busy and that she would find our server for us. She finally comes out with the bill; no apologies whatsoever and says \""here you go\""\n\nWe give the card right away an then she goes missing again for another 10 minutes.\n\nI've had busy days myself but this server was just awful!!! I'm still so upset about my whole experience and how it ruined my whole afternoon. I'm pretty sure I'll never be back there and if I had Kristina as a server again I would be sure to peace out with a quickness!!!!",665,0
Just came back stay at the aria thought was real glitzy my room was on the 3rd floor overlooking not the drip air vent type stuff was dirty window was very pricey hotel plus snacks in the mini bar 5$OMG buy your pop at the shop they have second night they did not come in and change  sheets and towels still on floor when back around midnight see some shows will not be staying may visit and gamble did win there was right next city center looking no buying.

"This place has really good food and some of the best oysters I've ever had but the only reason I give this place three stars is because the way they prepare the food looks really unsanitary. It's like there isn't any soap here at oyster bar and not too many things get washed or cleaned. You'll probably cringe when you see the dirtiness of the kitchen and the work areas, but if you're able to ignore that, then you'll love this place. \n\nWhen ever I'm here, I usually share the Palace Station pan roast and a dozen oysters.",127,2

"If you want to drink beer and roast marshmallows then this is the place. IF you want a nice dinner and a decent mixed drink then GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. The food is ok as long as you stay with the bar food stuff, There high dollar food is a joke (Stay Away). As far as drinks go if you stick with beer you are good, If you are into a good mixed drink then you are in trouble they have no idea how to make drinks here and charge $7.50 for a watered down Margarita that has a 1/2 shot of booze (SAD). They measure there drinks and for that price they really need to get a real bartender there.. All in all if you just want some cheese sticks and a beer and have some cowboy atmosphere then this is the place. If you are trying to impress a date then go somewhere else and have a mush better experience.. My bottom line is this is a overpriced BEER BAR.. I paid $11.00 for 1 crappy margarita and a beer in plastic cups..... WEAK",214,0
"My husband and I were in town and come across this restaurant..loved the name and we love Mac & Cheese so we decided to stop for dinner there. It was a Sat. night around 7:00 pm when we arrived, the place is small (container) so I would say there was one family sitting next to us, one person inside just standing waiting for his order and I am not sure how many customers sitting outside waiting for their order.\nWe order the Gourmet Toasted Cheese Sandwich, the 3 Cheese Mac & Cheese and the Sliders also 2 beers. The young lady taking our order acting like she really didn't wait to be there and didn't even ask if we wanted our beer as we waited so we just sat down.  \nAfter waiting 15 minutes and seeing another guy get his beer as soon as he ordered I went back to the young lady and asked if we could have or beer, she asked me if I wanted to order 2 beers I said no we already did and payed for them she then asked me what kind and finally got them.\nNow the family that was sitting next to us has received their food, ate it and had left and we are still waiting for our food, plus a worker from the BBQ place in Container Park came over order food after we had ordered and received it before it before we received our food..it is now 7:20 and we see a cheese sandwich sitting in the window and my husband says he is sure this one must be his..after about 5 minutes of sitting in the window the young lady finally brings the sandwich over to him....which was cold..had no taste, there was suppose to have basil on it..nope no basil..it was cold and dry sandwich...next came the mac & cheese...a little hotter but again if there was 3 cheeses in there I will eat a hat!   To me it tasted like a cold Macaroni Salad.\n Most of the time when I have dinner with my husband I like to eat with him not in this case after my husband received his sandwich and mac/cheese and was eating while I still had to wait for my sliders..which I am happy to say were really good..I ended up letting my husband have one since his meal was so bad. So we thought would be a quick dinner turned into more than a hour, I would say they have some work to do, faster service and trained your staff to be a little more warmer. Would we eat there again, maybe I really did love sliders and my husband would like to try the pork and beans..so I hope next time is better.",541,1
"This place is worse than the Keystone cops--a total, disorganized clusterf**k.  Where do I begin.....Hmmmm.....to start, no one was around their MASSIVE parking lot when we attempted to return our car.  NO ONE.  There was a sign that said \""E-receipt here\"".  Sounded OK.  It took forever just to get the car, and we got a free tank of gas because of it, so an E-receipt sounds good, right?  Just drop off the car and catch our flight, especially since there was no one around?  Hah!  no.  Apparently, when we approached the customer service desk to turn in the keys,  the customer service guy said that using that line was for preferred customers only, and we needed to get back in the car and FIND the check out employee!!!  We asked why it didn't specifically say that E-receipts were for preferred customers, and were told that \""if you were a preferred customer, you would've just known.\""  I don't need to guess what their stupid promo lines mean, not my job, I'm a CUSTOMER.  We also mentioned to this guy that we couldn't find anyone to check out our car.  He begins arguing that there IS someone out there---a woman--he \""swears\"" she's out there, somewhere.  My husband, fed up told the guy to either check us out officially, or we were throwing him the damn keys and leaving to catch our flight either way.  We don't need a manual about what their signs mean, and we don't need to go chasing down their employees so that they can do their jobs, so he better get his ass on over and check us out, because we'd had it with him and AVIS.  He checked us out.  THEN, the (manager?) came out to see what was up.  He was one of the guys who didn't have it together when we got the car, and gave us a tank of gas for taking forever.  We let him know how pathetic the checkout procedures were, how pathetic their signage was, and how unavailable their personnel was.  Enterprise has these guys beaten hands down.  We will NEVER, EVER rent from AVIS again.  If you do, then just know---you've been warned!!!",491,0

"Back here again with my monthly ladies' lunch group. I ordered the lunch combo: 1 pizza, soup, and a tropical ice tea. The soup was chicken noodle soup today, it was loaded with goodies (carrots, onions, celery, chicken and lots of noodles). The soup was good, not too salty. I ordered the pepperoni pizza. Unfortunately, it is on the extra crispy side. The tip of the pizza was a black and the crust was super crispy. I did not attempt to eat the crust, way too hard. It was better last time. The soup and nonstop flowing of ice tea was good. The service is always excellent.",133,2
"Had eaten a ton while visiting but still wanted to try this place.  I'm not a huge pork belly fan so I couldn't quite enjoy the fattiness but I can see this being very delectable to those who do.  The sauerkraut is a nice touch.\n\nApparently the original chopped salad has its own Facebook page, which is fun and kind of annoying because I hate having to go to Facebook for everything nowadays.  Fortunately the waiter explained what was in it, which included things like smoked salmon, sunflower seeds and raisins.  I'm normally not a fan of smoked salmon or raisins (no, I don't hate everything, I swear) but it worked out well in this salad.\n\nShared the filet mignon with my wife as an entree.  Absolutely delicious.\n\nWe got the Moe'scow Mule and a Sazerac as drinks.  Both were made well.",190,3
"Nicely designed space, very good food, inconsistent service.\n\nWell designed not only for aesthetics, but functionality.  The low glass back to the bar makes the kitchen noise almost unnoticeable.  The lighting is beautifully done, settings inside and on two outside areas are great for conversation.\n\nThe music on one visit was sophisticated background theme, went well with decor and ambiance.  Another time it was sappy 1970's love songs turned up to a.m.-radio-at-the-lake levels.  When we asked to change the music, they put on something like Deadmou5, and we thought we were supposed to jump up and down by a hotel pool.  We finally got them to at least turn that down.  They were willing, but didn't actually know how.  \n\nThe place seems very well thought out as to design and menu, but understaffed and undertrained on the wait side.  One inexperienced waitstaffer served us regular pasta as gluten free.  It's nice that they offer a gluten free pasta, but it defeats the purpose if the staff doesn't know the difference.  Thankfully we did, on sight, and sent it back.  They were very apologetic and picked up the tab for the gluten free pasta, which was shows some sophistication at the management level.  The server was new and she was doing her best but  seemed to need more backup.\n\nThere are a few bugs to work out, but the location, design, menu and capability seem to be in a good place here.

"The experience of walking into this river-front homage to a traditional German bier hall feels less like my idea of Oktoberfest in Munich and more like Bill Murray's life a la Groundhog Day.  I can say this because I've been there 3-4 times and the story always plays out the same way...it's up to you to somehow drive the plot in a different direction.  Perhaps I'm missing the point...after all we return to most establishments seeking a consistent and memorable investment of our time and money...but I like to think we as Pittsburghers take more pride in our small locally owned watering holes than the same hoopla you'd find at Busch Gardens.  \n\nThere is no formal parking lot at the Hofbrauhaus, just several nearby multi-level parking garages and a handful of metered spots in and around the Southside Works complex.  Chances are you'll pay something to park within walking distance.  \n\nOnce inside everything seems larger than life...the tall ceilings, medieval sized tables that seat dozens, the shameless display of cleavage, and most of all...my disdain for boring and flavorless lagers.  I'll admit...I am a total beer snob...always hunting down the hoppiest of imperial IPA, but I will gladly find comfort in a nice malty dopplebock if it's available.  Alas, i've learned from the Seasonal release schedule that February is the only time of year when the style is on tap. \n\nThe food is exactly what you'd hope for; variations of wursts, schnitzels, potato pancakes and pretzels as well as some \""American\"" choices - Burgers, Salads, etc.  It's the cavalade of starch and sausage that you'd want while eating cafeteria style to the tune of Journey's \""Don't stop believing\"" honked out on accordion.  \n\nWho doesn't like to have their meal-time conversation interrupted by yinzers of all ages shouting a mispronounced \""ZICKE ZACKE\""  atop the same wooden benches that make it near impossible to \""shimmy\"" yourself out to use the restroom.  \n\nThough I've never taken part in a shot-ski...I get the appeal.  The overall sense of merriment at the Hofbrau is perfect for getting large groups together as an impersonal celebration of special events, birthdays and a place to party with absolute strangers on any given weeknight.  For my money, I'll stick to Penn Brewery to get my fix of German fare with house-made brews...but thats just me; The hop-head whose personal nightmare is accepting being just a predictable part of the crowd.",571,1

"There is only one reason why I didn't give 5 stars. I will explain at the very end of this review. \n\nMy husband and I have stayed at the W in our past travel including NYC, Hong Kong, Sydney and many more. Yes, we have always been a fan. However, on our recent trip to Montreal we almost opted out of staying at the W. We thought we would stay at a hotel more classic, less trendy sort of thing. So happy we stay true to our long term love. You are everything you claimed to be.

"Do not use this company to rent your property. \n\nI contracted with the Milwaukee division of the company and deeply regret it. After ending the contract two months prior, the management informed me that I had 3 days to pay them 2200.00$ or they would place a lien on the property. They insisted that I had been contacted multiple times for non-payment. When I pushed the subject over several emails by asking that these requests for payment be forwarded to me in case they had been sent to spam, they could not provide the information. Instead, they made up an elaborate lie that I had requested a financial statement (which I never received) be sent to my home, and later admitted there must have been a miscommunication.\"" In fact, the final financial was not emailed to me until the day after they requested the huge payment, and they had no other documentation of attempts to collect monies from me through email or phone.\n\nThe financial conflict is just the tip of the iceberg, I recently visited my property and started to question the management's work for the entire year. I found that several of the things they charged me for at the beginning of the contract were not done- blinds were not hung, debris in the basement was not removed, etc. \n\nCurrently, the manager insists that the house is in \""great\"" shape for renting or selling, but this could not be further from the truth. The carpet was destroyed by the tenet, the walls were dirty and needed re-painting, a new door was broken, the kitchen and bathroom sinks were leaking, and the bathrooms were filthy. The property received multiple citations from Neighborhood Services about the lawn. The condition of the home was only \""rent ready\"" if someone is a slumlord, which I am not.\n\nThese people do not expect the owners to ever return to the property to check on it. Fortunately, I have friends in Milwaukee who kept an eye on and record of the property. \n\nFurthermore, the company has refused to send me copies of the invoices for the work they insist was done in the house.  In the final invoice they charged me for the management's gas expenses to and from the property, even though there is already a charge for their services attached to the contract.\n\nAgain, do not use this company to manage your home or other properties. You may be horrified and ashamed at how they represent your interests and far worse off financially.",509,0
"On Sunday my family was here visiting from California and after a day of shopping, this Wal-mart was the most convenient location for me to shop for some quick groceries. \n\nUpon walking into this Wal-mart, the unprofessionalism of the staff at this location was shocking to me, and this Wal-mart was very unmaintained.\n\nThe door greeter was hitting on some girl and they had an \""Asset Protection\"" employee going along with it.

I explained to the cashier that the purchase was being made by my father and I was not going to be involved in the consumption of the liquor but she still demanded to see everyone's IDs. I understand that stores can set their own liquor policies but the rudeness of this staff member was ridiculous. I also explained to her that their policy was faulty, and asked her why she is carding all the adults but not the children. I walked away to avoid further confrontation while my father purchased everything else.\n\nUpon exiting this Wal-mart, their \""Asset Protection\"" asked to see my receipt. Obviously this Wal-mart is run by idiots who do not understand that they cannot ask to see someone receipt without either a written statement placed in plain view explaining that they reserve the right to see receipts (Fry's Electronics), or written in the contract upon joining a club store (Costco, Sam's). \n\nThis Wal-Mart is a joke and should be avoided.",322,0
"Authentically tasting, inexpensive Chinese food amongst a humble collection of restaurant and stores. We ordered the steamed pork dumplings and chicken stir fry noodles. \n\nFood: 4 Stars. I thought the pork dumpling flavors were excellent. The moist and chewy wrapping conceals the steamy tender pork that is spiced just right. They are quite hot, so use caution before biting into the dough. The noodles were also quite delicious and easily deemed \""Asian comfort food.\"" They were somewhat greasy, with that stick to your bones consistency. The noodles are dense and best shared by at least two people. \n\nAmbiance/Service: 2 Stars. Maybe it was just this particular occasion, but I did not feel very comfortable sitting in the restaurant. Here's why: we were positioned at a booth near the wall, where one side was padded and the other was a wooden bench. It was fine enough, but then, through the padded side, you could feel every wiggle and squirm from the people in the booth behind us. At one point, I found myself battling against them to keep my back support in a normal upright position! Meanwhile, my wife ordered a coke (served in a can) and I had water. Neither were refilled nor did we see the servers very much to even ask. These aren't deal breakers, but a little added attention would have done wonders for the evening. \n\nOverall, I like what I tasted and would be willing to come back and try out more from the menu.",313,2
"If you're looking for traditional greek food, then this isn't the place to go to. But the people who go here aren't looking for that and for what they offer, they do it all very well. The gyro pita is amazing, I've probably had hundreds of them.",62,3

The food here is very good. I've loved nearly everything I've tried. I will say that I only ever get take out. The restaurant itself is really small and often packed. If you are in the mood for a pasty though this will hit the spot.,57,3
"Definitely not impressed. Haven't been here in a long time and a lot has changed. There has been a redesign in the layout. There used to be granite tables now it's cheap tables covered with a cloth, which would be ok until you sit down and notice the butcher paper used to cover the cloth; what a cheap move!! \nService was incredibly slow even though they where only about a quarter capacity. Most of our food came out before our drinks and we had to constantly ask for all the necessities for our food. Chili, silverware, saucses, etc..\nThe flavor of the food was as good as I remember, but when considering the price of what you pay versus the portion size I rate this a fail. Be prepared to pay a good $20 per person for your food, drink, and tip then walk out still feeling hungry. As of right now I say avoid this place and find some place else to fool you up.",196,1
"It's 115 degrees F outside and you've got burn marks on your butt from sitting on the leather seat in your car trying to make it to Chinatown through the underpass as fast as you can. There's traffic. \""Damn tourists are everywhere!\"" you mutter underneath your breath. You think that waiting for the light to change at Paradise underneath the monorail shade might just help....especially since your a/c went out the other day. But the traffic pushes you just barely out of the shade and into the blazing noon sun. You cry out in pain, \""Dang this sucks!\"" They keep saying it's a dry heat...but it still hurts. Solution? You need a cool refreshing fruit slushy boba....and you need it fast!\n\nAs far as boba goes....I prefer mine with fresh fruit. I don't subscribe to the powdered mixes that some people prefer b/c I find them far too saccharine. Even other boba shops that purport to make fresh fruit slushies make it far too sweet for my tastes. If you're like me, this non-descript, unassuming little shop inside the Chinatown Plaza mall (just to the right, 2 stores down from the entrance) makes some of the absolute best fresh fruit slushies with boba I've ever had in the bay area, NYC, Houston and elsewhere - prolly a near perfect 10 for me!\n\nThe boba itself is done right - not too hard, not too soft. It comes a bit warm like all places, which then melts the fruit slush a bit more....tempering the sweetness even more. They have an extensive menu choice for fresh fruit - mango, watermelon, etc. (Just look to the side shelf and you'll see all the fresh fruit they buy to make their creations!) They even run seasonal specials - look for the signs near the counter. My fave? The watermelon with boba. Otherwise, the kiwi or the honey dew melon are close seconds! \n\nThis is totally a mom & pop joint and not some bubble tea mecca like Tea Planet just a few doors down. So not much space to sit in...but just order a couple and sit on the steps of the plaza near the entrance to cool off from that Las Vegas summer heat..or walk around and peruse the store next door for some pretty kitschy stuff - we once saw a belt buckle with the LV sign saying \""Welcome to fabdau Las Vegas\"". That's awesome.\n\nI don't like their coffee, or black tea versions of boba. For that I'd go elsewhere (TP seems to be the best), but they do one thing better than those other places - cheap, fresh fruit slushies that aren't too sweet. 5 stars for the \""No. 1 Boba\""! They're \""fabdau\""!",598,4

I have had the misfortune of eating at this buffet twice (the second time because I arrived at the hotel for a show and got there too late to eat anywhere else). For $12.99 for a dinner buffet you would believe that at least something decent would be put out. About the only reason I give the place two stars is that the service is decent. For food I would give it zero stars if that were possible - and I'm not that hard to please.,99,1
"Went here for 3 day conference in April, this is a nice Embassy Suites located not too far from the strip of Las Vegas. This is a corporate hotel rather than a gambling hotel. Thank goodness because work and gambling does not go well together. The suites were spacious and some of the amenities included; refrigerator, microwave, working desk, separate living area and bedroom. What I love about Embassy Suites hotels is that your stay comes with complimentary cooked to order breakfast buffet and evening manager's reception with complimentary alcohol beverages and light hors d' oeuvres. The breakfast here is my favorite...not the type of complimentary continental breakfast where you get some fruits, bagel and muffins...this is the real thing. Bacon, sausages, amazing cut potatoes, French toast, waffles, and pancake (depending on the day) and everything else you can think of. Of course you can't forget the famous cooked-to-order omelet station...you tell the chef what you want in your omelet and chef makes it for you right there. What's what I call excellent services. Where else do you get an awesome breakfast and drinks for free? Not anywhere in Vegas that I know of. Complimentary internet access is offered in the business center for all guests of the hotel, this includes printing, faxing and etc. really great for business travelers. \nStaffs here are all very friendly and accommodating, the banquet captain was excellent and the event food was great. This is my second time staying at an Embassy Suites property and I would not mind staying here again in the future for business and not so much for leisure. \n\nThe one thing that threw me off about this place was the palm tree in the living room of the suite...it did not belong there and does not look good. I am confused as to what theme they were going for and I still haven't figured it out yet. The other thing that I had a problem with was my hair dryer was not working as a hair dryer...more like a vibrator with the sound of a jackhammer. I called the front desk to have it replaced and the new one worked just fine. I guess my problem was....did housekeeping not check to make sure the hair dryer worked before checking someone in? Maybe the last guest did not complain...at least now the next guest will have a hair dyer instead of a vibrating jackhammer. \n\nOverall I had a nice experience and the hotel offered everything I needed during my stay for the conference. My review on this hotel is based on business travel and not leisure travel since I did not even get to leave the hotel to do any Vegas type of fun for entire week I was there! Maybe next time...",549,2
"I have really mixed feelings for this office. I want to love it, but at the same time I absolutely hate it. \n\nFor one, I can completely agree with Amanda B. that Dr. Agarwal is a great doctor. We gave birth to our daughter at home so we did not receive a routine hospital newborn screening, and had to make her an appointment for the day after her birth. We were easily able to make an appointment for that morning (she was born Sunday night at 11, we called at 8 Monday am and had a 10 am appt). We were seen by his assistant, Brita Overly, and then by Dr. Agarwal himself. His newborn screen was thorough and he was very genuine and worked so well with our teeny tiny babe. I was so happy we had found a great doctor.\n\nFollowing visits were not as excellent. While I still believe the doctors and assistants are great, I find the office to be highly unorganized. We always had extremely long waits (anywhere from 45 - over 60 min), and we had a lot of issues with our daughter receiving her vaccinations. We first went in and they were out of one so they recommended waiting until they got it in to do the rest. We were supposed to have gotten a phone call in the next couple of days to schedule a time to come in, but after a week we hadn't heard anything. Finally I called and they scheduled us to come in for the shots. The morning of the appointment the office called and said they were still out of it and wouldn't have it in until the next day. So we rescheduled for the following day. \n\nThe next morning I get a phone call that they still didn't have them and wouldn't until early the next week. Ooookay......so I rescheduled YET AGAIN. After all of the rescheduling and miscommunication, my daughter was TWO WEEKS LATE receiving her vaccinations. I'm not sure why I didn't consider another office after that. \n\nNow our daughter is due for her 4 month immunizations, with an appointment this week. I received a call Friday from the office saying they were AGAIN out of one of the shots so they would need to reschedule. At this point I just cancelled her appointment and began researching another office. We'll now be seeing Dr. Alexander at Camelback Pediatrics. \n\nI really wanted to love Desert Ridge Children's Center, but their complete lack of organization worries me when it comes to my daughter's wellbeing.",532,2
"I effing hate this place. Of course, I was in grad school and not an undergrad. I guess if you are just turning 21 and have nothing to compare an inexperienced nightlife to, perhaps this place could be one of those places for you. However, for all others that have lounged in NYC or upper Chicago, this place is loud, sticky, smelly, and just a big meat market for international students. I am an ethnic Asian myself, however, it was a big turn off when they acted very pretentious (like u \""made it in life\"") because you are partying and seen at Clybourne on fucking Green St. I found the whole demographics off in this place. It just boiled down to slutty drunk Asian girls and the yellow fever people chasing a wanna be geisha into the smoke and mirrors dance floor. All around sloppy. Pass.",176,0
"I saw pictures of the drinks and it won me over. The goblet drink was big enough to share with one other person. Each item on the menu had something sweet to it.

"This is what YELP is for and the Baladie cafe is for Yelpers!  I can really appreciate a small privately owned place.  I appreciate a place where the owners appreciate my business. \n\nIt is a small place in a Vons plaza - but the Vons is closed.  I have been by here a million times but never even thought about going in here for lunch. \n\nIt is a tiny place with 5 or 6 tables.  They have mediterranean food and greek food.  I had the Gyro plate with some fries.  The fries were seasoned and served with a flavorful dipping sauce.  The Gyro plate had all the fixins for a gyro but it was unassembled.  I liked putting it together.   All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful.\n\nThis place offers a great value.  The food is quality eats... something you would expect in a finer establishment with higher prices.  So for a quick serve place and quick serve prices - you get great food, real plates, and great service!\n\nSince I live in the general area it was refreshing to find a mom and pop joint mixed in with all of the chain restaurants.\n\n(I have been staring at my computer debating whether I should do 4 or 5 stars...)",273,3

"Growing up in Texas, I'm a pretty hard customer to please when it comes to barbecue. Lucille's did not do it for me, but with limited options in Vegas, I wouldn't completely write them off.\n\nOpted for quite a variety of menu options, don't know that I'd highly suggest any of them. Definitely consider starting with an alcoholic beverage, the house margarita was tasty- I forget it's clever name though.\n\nComplimentary BISCUITS upon seating- topped with cinnamon sugar why? Would be so much better unseasoned with regular butter, as others have said.\nBRISKET CHILI- large portion, tasty, but brisket isn't as flavorful as I'd like. Adding cheese and sour cream kind of covers up some of the flavor. Cornbread is sweet, which isn't my preference.\nPULLED PORK SANDWICH- large and juicy, top bun is disposable as there's nothing on it and the bun is quite large. Not really a sandwich you can easily pick up to eat. Served with fresh-made chips, which were actually quite delicious. \nTRI SALAD- salad topped with tri-tip and grilled veggies, gigantic in size and fresh. Worth a try if you're on a salad or health-centric kick, the meat is a good portion and isn't dry, which still makes it enjoyable for a steak at a bbq joint.\nCHICKEN QUESADILLA AND GRILLED ARTICHOKE- had high hopes for this meal made of two half-size entrees, but was underwhelmed. Barbecue chicken in the quesadilla isn't particularly flavorful, despite simply being accompanied by grilled peppers and onions. LIghtly topped with a mostly-decorative design of red pepper sauce and barbecue sauce, this simply had too much going on and the chicken seemed bland, easily overpowered by everything else in the dish. Artichoke was artfully presented but a little difficult to eat, all but diehard artichoke fans need not apply.\n\nLayout is a little odd, with a street entrance and a casino entrance- on a weekend afternoon, signage at the front of the latter instructed us to go through the restaurant to the other side of the bar to the other hostess stand for seating. Having never been there before, it was difficult to find and we basically wandered the dining room until we turned the corner making the stand itself visible. Not such a great plan- maybe have staff on the lookout to escort guests to the right place.\n\nService was fairly attentive despite a shift change during our meal, bonus points for the classic Ball canning jars used as water glasses. We were seated facing the bar, which has three TV screens above it, someone please change the middle TV from cartoons- bizarre choice of programming as this isn't really a child-friendly place.",590,2

"Will never shop there again. Worst customer service ever. Went and bought muscle tech protein and had to return it do to swallowing large chunks of something rubbery in the protein. Drove back the next day and exchanged it for lean body protein. What do you know, large chunks of this nasty rubbery substance in them as well. Went back to return it and she told us that all the protein is from the summer and had been out in the Arizona heat during shipment and that's probably what did it. I almost threw up in my mouth but she didn't seem to care one bit. Before I left, I grabbed some Atkins m&m's and I could hear them rolling around in the box and the box was also pretty damaged. I brought them to the front desk and she said,\"" hmm, that's weird,\"" and put them back on the shelf. Reallly??!!! All of the male employees are ZERO help and are constantly on their phones texting and Facebooking away. When you ask a question, they look at you as though you have disturbed their precious time. And to top it all off, after two batches of nasty defective protein they would only give us store credit no refund. We have been shopping with vitamin shop forever and just recently moved so had to switch locations. It's been so bad I refuse to shop at any vitamin shoppe ever again.

"So we went there last night for my bday. We had reservations at 645 and then had to change them to 715, when we got there they only made us wait about 2 mins to clean the table, which was nice!  Allison was our server, which we had her last time as well- super nice, once again:) Great service! \nI started with their Bloody Mary not spicy and my husband got a Fat Tire on draft. The bloody mary was sooo spicy even adding tomato juice hah so I ended up getting something else, which they were very accommodating. We started with the chix lettuce wraps, which were awesome as always, then I ordered the Changs spicy Chicken and my husband ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Rice. I was a little disappointed that the Changs spciy chicken seemed a little dry and I have gotten it in the past with success and the Shrimp and Chicken had 6-7 pieces of meat in it. Bummer. TONS of rice tho, you should see the bowl it comes in, so if you like rice with a taste of meat, its your meal, I wouldn't advise for men! Then they brought out a dessert shooter for my bday which was nice. I only had two bites and my husband ate it, which he loved. All together a good place to go, just bummed that the food was a little blah this time. The manager usually comes to the table and asks how everything was and what not, I would have told him our service was great but he was hanging out at the hostess station... but like I said all in all a cool place.",337,2
"I'd give the food 4 stars but the service a 3. It's worth stopping by if you're in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go too out of my way. The coffee was delicious and the espresso menu was amazing. Unfortunately we waited 30 mins for our food and an additional 10 for mine. On the bright side, they had accidentally added meat to my plate (I'm a vegetarian) and they remade the entire plate without me even asking, hence the extra 10 minutes.\n\nSpoiler alert: the tables are not orange",123,2
"I guess as I'm getting older I'm seeing the value in things a little more clearly. I used to really enjoy going out to eat and didn't ever stop to wonder if I was getting a good deal. Lately, though, I've been paying close attention to what all of the foods cost and comparing them to other eating establishments.\n\nMy daughter's school was having a fundraiser at this Chili's last night. It was the kind that they donate a certain percentage of the total bill to the school. We try to help the school whenever we can, so we decided to make it a fun night out with the kids. My daughters enjoyed themselves and saw a few friends, and we all got to relax and let other people do the work.\n\nMy issue with this restaurant, though, and why I gave it two stars, is strictly with the value of the food. I understand that the costs of everything are increasing, so business establishments have to raise their prices accordingly, but they should still be able to offer a decent value.\n\nWe ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger for my wife and I to split, and the kids ordered a corn dog and a quesadilla. My wife and I usually split meals because they are so big and calorie-laden, and it helps to keep costs down. Most of the time we leave feeling full and happy. When they brought out our food this evening, though, my half of the burger was tiny! The burger was supposed to contain bacon and onion straws, and according to pictures, was supposed to be packed with them. There was a tiny piece of bacon on my half, and a few scattered onion straws. I looked over to my wife's plate, expecting to see the bulk of the toppings on her burger, but her toppings were as pathetic looking as mine. The size of her half of the burger was not much bigger than mine, either. She said hers was exceptionally greasy and didn't taste how she expected it to taste. This was a little burger to start out with, and splitting it only made it worse. And it was $10.99!!\n\nThe burgers are, like most places, served with french fries. When we split meals at other restaurants, they usually give us both a full portion of fries. I know it's not the healthiest thing to be chomping down, but because we go out to eat so infrequently we don't worry about it. We want to get a pile of fries with our meal. The amount of fries delivered with our meal last night was a joke! My wife had maybe fifteen fries on her plate, and I had about eight. Seriously?! I know this restaurant is in business to make money, so they don't want to give everything away, but how much does an extra handful of fries cost for the few people that are splitting meals.\n\nThe kids meals were, in their opinion, good. The corn dog and celery sticks were quickly devoured, while the quesadilla and oranges were left mostly intact. (typical kids!). I tried a few bites of the quesadilla. It was ok, but was pretty small because of the meager amount of cheese. The kids meals, with the included drink, are $4.99. Not cheap, but not outrageous either.\n\nI like to leave every restaurant feeling that I got a good value for my money. I know that a good restaurant can give me that, while still making a decent profit off of me. When we left last night we looked at our bill and reminded ourselves why we don't go out very often. My wife said that she's going to keep the bill, so that any time she craves this type of food she can look at it and remind herself that we can eat much better and cheaper at home. Or at least at a restaurant that gives us our money's worth.",806,1

"Just got married here in February..... and it was a diaster! I should've been more concerned when everything was so laid back, but that's me so I wasn't stressing.\nFor starters the package we purchased came with a one night stay that the chapel is supposed to book... Which they did not! They're reasoning was that we didn't tell them we were staying any other nights at the hotel. I'm not sure what difference that made but they fixed the error. \nThe ceremony itself was fun and the officiant really made it feel like it wasn't the same thing he had just done 30 minutes ago which I really liked. \nAs for the video.photography it was rotten! Our contract says no recording and no flash photography during the ceremony... the photographer announced NO PHOTOS period!!! NONE!!! After the ceremony the photographer was doing all the typical wedding photos that are wanted. Unfortunately she was relying on me to tell her what to do and when I finally said \""Ok, I just got married, never been married before this is your job why don't you tell me what pictures I should be doing?' Her response was \""Ok we're done here\"" With full on attitude... Umm I'm sorry but weren't we paying you to handle that part?\nSo we go the next day to check out the photos and was ready to have to drop some serious money as we assumed they wouldn't be cheap. We walked in to a desk with 2 8x10's, this cheesy collage thing and some other random stuff. We had 24 images that came with our package so we decided to go thru the 120 or so pics the photographer got. (Which was actually quite a bit for a 30 min ceremony) We seperated them in have to have & maybe & No.... WE HAD 12 HAD TO HAVE PICTURES!!!! That was it! 10 Maybe!!! The edited ones were elemntary photoshop... thr ironic part was that in one of the black  white images my flowers were the only thing in color.... my flowers should have been lavender.... THEY WERE PINK! I didn't catch it until then!! My best man should've had a lavender boutenierre and it was white! Long story short we left with strictly the 24 that came with our package and I had to call her again to get the photo album that was supposed to come with it as well..... which was recieved with yet another attitude!

"If cleanliness is next to godliness then The Betos is perched on the rim of the 6th circle of hell.\nThat doesn't mean it's bad mexican food. In fact, it's decent enough to be a \""guilty Pleasure\"". But you will be guilty (you will also not be constipated the next morning, ahhh, the lubricating effects of copious amounts of animal fat).\nI was helping my daughter buy and assemble some IKEA furniture (and I use the word \""furniture\"" loosely in conjunction with IKEA) and she bought me lunch at The Betos (are they a family, or what?). She didn't realize that I had been here before (as I said...it's a guilty pleasure...I don't advertise things like this as a general rule).

There was no TV in the female lounge, but there was one in the Men's-which I heard from my boyfriend was actually very nice, and everything was in its place.  If you can manage to dodge the many employees loitering the area it can be relaxing.  \n\nOn sat 12/15 afternoon i got a ginger lily sugar rub- don't let the name fool you, its just an overpriced showerhead \""massage\"" they throw some sugar on you, not exfoliating in the least and rinse you off for 20 minutes of the 25 minute service at a whopping charge of $85 not including the 20% service charge of $17 which stated on the price list \""has been added\"" - but it's false advertisement, they add that charge later once you've been billed.   \n\nNo matter I will not return, and would prefer to try a better spa next time in Vegas.  But if you get the chance visit the Bacara Spa in Santa Barbara, now that will exceed anyone's expectations!!",313,2
"I had lunch here the other day and over all my experiences was okay. Nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about either. \n\nMy friend and I both had the Grilled Steak, which was flavored very nicely.  \n\nThe wait staff during the lunch hour were extremely nice. If you in the area and looking for a place to eat, give this place a try.",82,2
"I think this place deserves a sound review for the adventure's it has taken me over the past couple months since it's renovations. Before AMC bought out this theater, it was known as Rave Motion Pictures or something of the sort. I'm not going to lie, I loved the old theater because they had become my comfortable norm. Now, well, at first it really let me down. I know it's not the best thing in the world to shut down a place just to renovate the area, but at least do it step by step and don't leave the place looking all janky. \n\nWhen they first started remodeling after the \""AMC TAKEOVER\"" everything just seemed blah. I'm not not prissy princess who has to have everything of certain quality, but I did grow up in Detroit and have seen some of the shadiest movie theaters and this one was running a close second to some of the ones I've seen. The concession stands were in disarray for a good couple of months. \n\nI won't lie, this renovation process made me not want to come back to my beloved Town Square theater. BUT, as time went on I have increasingly been impressed by the steadied improvement of the quality of the theater. I understand that it takes time to take a place and make it your own, and in AMC's case it did take a little longer than I anticipated. Maybe it is because I do go see a lot of movies but I am glad that I didn't lose faith because I've always enjoyed my experience at this particular theater.\n\nSo you're probably scratching your head. Looking at my review in disgust huh? You're probably wondering why I gave out a 3-star review. Well the only reason I am giving out that rating is because on numerous occasions the movie I am supposed to be watching is delayed. For whatever reason, the move is supposed to start but it seems as if everyone in the theater is awkwardly trying to be quiet while no movie progresses. Another thing is that some of the staff aren't the most receptive. I happened to walk out of my theater at the same time another movie got out. And security kind of made it seem like I was movie hopping. All I was doing was visiting the concessions stand and didn't have my ticket for whatever reason and they gave me a real hard time. I didn't appreciate the jump to conclusions, but I guess I can understand if it's been a problem. \n\nAnyway, I don't mind at the end of the day because this is my favorite place to watch movies, especially midnight premieres!",551,1
"I recently went here for reverse happy hour with my friend, Jason, on a Friday night. Now, north Scottsdale is not our normal place and we rarely venture up there but my friend wanted to go. As a girl, I wish he gave me some warning as to what to wear because i noticed the girls there were slightly more dressed up while I was dressed in a t-shirt, jeans, and boots. A pair of heels would've been better to go with the crowd. The place had a good atmosphere, ambiance, and were playing some fun music to get you in the mood for the night if you were going out afterwords. I know I lip synced to a song and serenaded Jason so if his ears were bleeding, from my \""singing,\"" his hearing must be going from something else. Or he was too distracted by the cute boy next to us. There was some eye candy there, also why I felt like I should have dressed a bit more.\n\nAnyways, the place was nicely filled and we didn't wait to be seated at a table. We ordered a Diamondback roll, the calamari and the veggie tempura. I've gone to a few sushi places for happy hour and some don't give you the appropriate portion size, but here it was a good size for apps to be shared between two people. The calamari and tempura was all right. The tempura had a nice heat to it as well as our Diamondback roll. We were fairly full from our order. Jason also ordered the witch doctor drink, which he loved. I didn't try it, but I intend to next time.",338,2
"Smelled great at first, but buffet selection was below par and having the runs for 2 days afterwards just killed it.  Listening to poolside techno at an Indian buffet was also weird.  DO NOT eat there before you go to the airport or a club, unless you're prepared to lay down some serious toilet paper on the seats.  Worst decision ever.",77,1
"Unfortunately my experience was not good.  The front office staff was nice and the waiting room w/ games and a movie was a great diversion while waiting for their appointments.  However I felt like since this was our first experience at this office, the hygienists and Dr. Rezakhan should have spent a little more time warming up to the kids and making them comfortable.  It was more of the get them in, get them out mentality, which I found to be disappointing.  Secondly, my kids have both had excellent dental care in the past and with our first visit to Dr. R - they had an excessive amount of cavities (they had been seen six months earlier by our family dentist out of state with no issues).   I immediately took my kids for a second opinion at a local family dentist and each child had one small cavity....not three or four!!  I would definitely use caution if considering this office, I will not go back again.",194,1

"Terrible customer service! I liked the one in Aliante so I figured centennial would be compatible. First, centennial is more expensive per garment 3.99 versus 1.99 in Aliante. However, wgen i dropped off my clothes , the lady, Dianne told me that I can print off coupons - which then would drop it down to 1.99 upon picking up my clothes. When I picked up, Vicki told me the coupons should have been presented when I dropped off the clothes. I told her what happened and what Diane had told me about the coupons. Vicki said Diane would not say that and she would not change the price unless it was their fault! Um... But it was their fault. In addition, she told me to then pick up my clothes when Diane was there. Furthermore, I asked to speak with the owner or her boss and she told me the owner would not want to talk to me and the General manager, Grace is not available on weekends. Great! I see now how valuable my business is not ! I paid full price for my cleaning and went on my way to Yelp!",231,0
"Went here with some local friends who are regulars at BJs.  I'd driven by it a hundred times and never gave it a second thought.  Looks like a typical dive bar from the outside.  Inside, though, was a pleasant surprise.  Open and comfortable, acceptable noise level, clean, and friendly.  Drinks were priced reasonably, and I believe there's a yelp check in deal.  We had a bunch of drinks, and I kinda dreaded the arrival of the bill, but I was again pleasantly surprised.  Probably less than 1/5 of what it would have cost us across the street at any MGM bar.  Good place to hang out for a little while and talk with friends.",149,3
"Pure bliss!  Great location, ever better service, and a lovely pool. I will say that if you like a quiet room, don't take one that faces the front of the hotel. Nearby bar patrons line up there for cabs, and light sleepers will be woken up by their revelry.",62,4

"El Burrito should have a much higher rating. It has a few problems though.\n\nMost of the staff seem very impressed with themselves (with the exception of one very nice older lady who I have seen mentioned in someone else's review elsewhere) and there's general awkwardness thanks to a few messy situations, such as pre-added mandatory tips when using discounts, coupons etc. \n\nThe food tastes good (the deluxe bean dip is spectacular!) but the prices are quite outrageous for Las Vegas. $18 bucks for a plate of Nachos when I can get a larger serving elsewhere for almost a quarter of that price and it would have to be stellar food to win me over.\n\nWorth a look, particularly if you have a coupon, but there's a bit of a weird vibe to the place.",173,2
"Good tapas... I loved the eggplant parm.  I would go back... it's a pretty fun atmosphere for drinks and a meal.  I like that they have outside seating on the terrace... from what I remember, it provides a pretty good view of the city, too.  \n\nOh, but the service was sloooooow.

"Agave Blue!  Where do I start?  So many things to mention that went into this 2 star review.  The West valley is lacking in FroYo places apparently - we are recent transplants to the area and in our previous state, places like these were a dime a dozen and apparently, all of that competition really drove up the quality and the customer service.  Here is my breakdown:\n\nYogurt selection:  4 stars- not too many choices - but selection is well thought out and everything is fresh.\n\nToppings:  2 stars - the only fruits available tonight were candied pineapples (blah) and cherries.  \n\nCustomer service:  2 stars.  I have to say - I am impressed watching the teenagers that staff this place clean.  They keep that place spotless. Unfortunately, they some have no customer service skills whatsoever. Tonight, my husband asked if there was anymore fruit available (several of the topping bins were empty in the fruit section) and the worker just said \""Nope.\""  No further discussion.  Depending on who is working, sometimes you get a welcome or a thank you, but more often than not there is no positive customer service interaction at all.  :(  \n\nLocation:  4 stars:  quiet location, easy parking, tables and chairs outside.  \n\nAll in all - 2 stars.  Raise the bar with customer service expectations and I would love to change this to a higher overall rating in the future :)",313,1

"Ok, I have to start by telling everyone this - if you were stupid enough to agree to the timeshare presentation, and furthermore, stupid enough to buy the damn thing (like we were) - please know that YOU HAVE 5 DAYS TO GET OUT OF IT!\n\nIt was a terrible experience and ruined my vacation. My vacation that I paid TONS of money for. We were in Vegas for Memorial Day weekend on a whim as I really just needed to relax. This trip was beyond stressful thanks to these horrible people.\n\nA guy (I think his name was Austin) in a booth in front of our hotel (TI) waved us over, asked if we were married (odd - but we are not) and offered us free show tix, etc - we were told we'd be getting a tour of a new resort for the purpose of word of mouth advertising. Had no idea this was a timeshare presentation.\n\n1. They kept us waiting for over an hour in the lobby - I asked whether this hour+ wait time was included in the 2-3 hours we were told we would have to be here in order to receive our \""free\"" gifts. NOPE! Should have demanded a refund and ride back to TI at this point, but we were already there (if you want an upgraded package you pay a bit and are promised tons more stuff)...\n2. They had told us not to eat beforehand as we would be fed lunch as part of the tour. By the time we got there my bf was beyond starving. Buffet at the Silverton was definitely subpar.\n3. Way far away from the strip. Why did I agree to buy this bs again?\n4. Pushy Pushy Pushy! High Pressure. It was hell. \n5. Lots of old people here. Didn't seem very fun to make up for the distance from the strip. Reminded me of a retirement home.\n6. We were there for a total of 8 hours. On Saturday. After a long drive the night before. After being told 2-3 hours. Ended up extending our hotel stay (which was super expensive) just to try to salvage our trip after this.\n7.

We had a driver take us back to the hotel at 8pm (on them luckily) as the shuttles had stopped running. I had instant buyer's remorse and vocalized this in the car. THANK GOD for this driver, I'd go back and tip her more if I could - she goes, well, I believe that by law you have 72 hours or something to get out of that.

"Due to a heavy footed neighbor upstairs in our hotel, I was up and about around 6am.  I knew I needed some coffee and donuts.  Dunkin Donuts is right near my hotel so I went and got a cup of coffee there.  Then headed here to get some donuts.  The Yelpers of Scottsdale did me right.  These donuts were very good....not Marys donuts good (Marys holds a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite), but maybe 2nd place ;-).    Still a 5 star joint! Placed my order for a chocolate covered buttermilk bar, a glazed raised, a chocolate raised and a crumb raised.  Total was $3.70 for 4 donuts.  Not shabby at all.  Here is how the donuts stacked up.\n\nChocolate Buttermilk Bar-  DAMN!  This was one of the best donuts I can ever remember eating!  This thing was crisp on the outside for a little crunch, dense on the inside (almost like a pound cake) for a good \""cake like\"" chew and had a ton of chocolate on it.  During the bites you could pick out the distinct buttermilk flavor.  This thing was awesome and I'm definitely coming back before I leave to get more of these.  They also had them in maple frosting and something else too.  Delicious!\n\nGlazed-  Not too shabby.  Very light and airy and not too sweet.  Definitely a good donut and I would get it again.\n\nCrumb- Pretty tasty also.  Good crumb topping and light and airy like the glazed.\n\nChocolate Raised- My wife ate that one and I didn't try it.  She liked it though and that's good enough for me.  If it was as good as the other 3 donuts, I'm sure it was great.\n\nThe lady at the counter was nice as can be and they even have a drive through!  If I lived in the area, this would definitely be my go to donut spot.  Bravo for the recommendations Scottsdale Yelpers....Bravo!",439,4
"This has to be the worst experience in Las Vegas.... I don't mind waiting, but I was quoted a 5-10 minute waiting time and was stuck there for ten minutes when they moved me back to a chair and waited over 20 more minutes while no one even looked at me while sitting in the back.  The man that did my nails ask me what I wanted and told me later he dreaded doing my nails because he thought I was a picky type.  Normally Glitter top acrylics and pink bottoms.. he suggested the easier already made tips and plain white bottoms for the SAME PRICE because he said it would look better.  I am not picky so I let him change up the way I normally get my nails done.. \n\nWell end of nail session... the nails were incorrectly sized leaving  some were larger than others and some longer than others, the acrylics were not dried correctly and have been pealing ever since,  there did not file the underside of the nail and two broke within the two days even after I told him there was a distinct line on the back of them from squeezing the tip too tight and they have within a week and a half almost all lifted and are breaking.  \n\nI went to my usually nail spot today and abruptly thanked them for problems I never thought I would get by trying a place closer to my house.  \nI wish I would have pictures of the crap they did.  \n\nDo not do it.

"To be fair, I have only tasted their restaurant week menu.  There regular menu might be executed better, though I doubt I will be back to find out.  For those of you trying to select which restaurant to try for Restaurant week a word (or many) of caution.  \nI decided to go with the wine pairings, which were ok though nothing to write home about.  Let me start with the bread, as I have come to judge a restaurant on this initial offering.  While not offensive the baguette had a chewy almost stale exterior-nothing like the crust you would find in any boulangerie in France.  I do wish that American restaurants would serve homestyle bread or even focaccia, rather than a poorly executed artisanal bread.  I did appreciate that the butter was salted and at room temperature rather than ice cold.  Onto the appetizer: I opted to start with the ravioli with truffle essence and fine herbs.  The only redeeming element of this dish was the faint flavor of truffle.  The pasta itself was tough.  It actually reminded me of the refrigerated ravioli you can buy at Trader Joes.  The broth that it came in was ok, but nothing that you would want to soak up the extra with your bread.  The best part of my dinner was the 2nd offering-the scallop mousse.  It was seasoned well and had a texture that would remind you of a cross between a panna cotta and egg custard.  The flavor was fresh, though the few peas on top were a but starchy.  I ended the meal with the sole entree. The sole lacked even the tiniest bit of salt or pepper, as did the steamed cauliflower beneath.  The sauce swirled around the perimeter of the plate was quite tasty, however, each element of a dish must be seasoned properly for it to be enjoyable to eat.  Given that I had expected to gorge myself on delicious food, I had eaten a very small lunch.  After leaving over half of the tough pasta and an entire filet of sole, I left the restaurant still hungry and set back $70.  If in the Biltmore area and looking for a nice meal, I would suggest Seasons 52.  Although not as trendy or fancy, I also have had much better food at Zinburger and True Food.",473,0

"On first glance, you might be inclined to compare this small, local farmers market to the larger, close-by Kings Drive Farmers Market. Don't do it. This market, begun several years ago in Plaza-Midwood, is where the locovores and organic farmers intersect. It is still relatively small as farmers markets go, but it has grown exponentially since its beginning. In fact, the move to South End last year signaled a new wave of growth for local food, especially Slow Food.\n\nAlthough the quantity and type of produce varies week-by-week, depending on what's in season, the place is packed with local growers who are generally very proud (and rightly so) of their eco-friendly farming practices. It is also the best place, in my opinion, to find locally-raised eggs and meat.  Yes, the meat is somewhat more expensive than what you'll find in the neighborhood Teeter, but the taste, quality, and general satisfaction you'll get from partaking of food raised right here in the Charlotte area, more than compensates for the higher price tag.\n\nAlthough its small size and sometimes erratic cast of vendors prevents me from rating it higher, this market is one to watch and support.

"Botero - this can be a magical place! The ambiance is very lovely overlooking a nicely landscaped faux water feature. The inside is trendy and there are obviously a number of artworks by Botero. The reception desk was less then welcoming and friendly but that was the only hitch. Once seated (we opted for the outside as the temperature was perfect). From that point on the service was impeccable. A visit from the sommelier proved helpful. They have a very large and nicely chosen wine list with a couple of hidden gems in the more modest price ranges (sub $120). Thank you. \n\nWe tried the Iberian pork appetizer which was amazing. Served with cold asparagus, toast, grilled red peppers and a cheese flan. A wonderful item to share. For dinner I chose the crusted fish with truffle dumplings and white asparagus. This was nicely executed and tasted great...but didn't wow me. My dining cohort, on the other hand, had a foodgasam with her choice of lamb chops. I managed to get a taste and can vouch that this was a strong choice. Also, need to mention the breadbasket...very nice assortment of breads and they were prepared with love. Definitely not an afterthought.\n\nOnly thing I found a bit odd was their music choice..I believe it was European club techno pop or if that's not a real category you get the idea.

"Ok, this is my 3rd time here in about a month.  I went today for lunch with the family which included Sweetie, my 2 young children and my Mother in Law.  We came back for lunch because my 2 kids are hit or miss on the behavior meter, luckily today was a good day.\nVine has been open now for a few weeks and some \""kinks\"" are starting to show.  Here's what I noticed today.\n1)  The service today was slack and unorganized for the most part.  It didn't flow properly.  i.e. It took us forever to be greeted by our server and take our drink orders.  We asked for a gluten free menu and our server instead of bringing it right to us went and took 2 other tables orders so we had to wait which prolonged everyone ordering.  Our drinks also went dry a few times and towards the end of the meal we didn't see our server for refills.  I was displeased with a portion of my meal and when they returned with the replacement nobody checked it prior to bringing it back to make sure it was better than what I returned which is a huge no no.\n2)  I ordered the Prime Rib Sandwich which was delicious!  Nice shaved Prime Rib, Caramelized Onions, Horseradish Aioli all put together on a nice bun.  It came with shoestring french fries.  The fries are, to say the least, horrible because they're mismanaged in the kitchen.  They arrived cold and stale along with my sandwich.  When I found my waitress, I explained that I didn't like them and the reason.  I was in the middle of eating my sandwich and she goes to take my whole plate (DUH) back to the kitchen.  No, Ma'am please just bring me a new plate with some hot fries.  Did you expect me to hold half my sandwich in my hand while I wait for you to come back?  When the fries came back they were equally as cold and stale as the first serving.  These fries are very thin and must be made to order IMO because they will not stay hot under a hot lamp.  The waitress even said it herself that they're hard to keep hot because of the way they are.....well CHANGE THEM you can't serve awesome sandwiches like the Prime Rib Sandwich with crappy fries, it sours the meal.  Seasoning on the fry that I tasted was different and tasty, it had a smoky backnote that would have been enjoyable had the fries been served hot.  The au jus served with the sandwich was also a bit thick and vinegary for my liking but it was fine.  \n3)  They don't seem to have a lunch menu which would be nice to see a different menu than what they provide for dinner.  I also would like to see something separate for the kids which they don't have.  When asked about a kids menu the waitress said that they can \""do a kids mac and cheese\"" which is simply their skillet mac and cheese side served on a plate\n\nEveryone else enjoyed what they had.  Napa Chicken Salad, Salmon sandwich and margherita flatbread for the kids.\n\nI still like this place, I guess I am always searching for perfection.  It has potential here and I hope it does well in this seemingly cursed location.",706,2
"I love Baker's window! The selection keeps on growing and every time I've stopped in I've been delighted to find several new items to try. I have a weakness for scones, so it's hard not to go for the door county cherry almond scone, which is delicious and the best scone I've had in Madison. I've managed to stop myself from getting the scone on a couple of occasions to try the croissants and the lavender-lemon tart. Both were outstanding! I've got my eye on a piece of pie for the next time I stop in. The owners and staff are also very friendly and inviting. Overall I can't say enough about the Baker's window!",149,4
If you love an authentic French restaurant this is the place because they are rude & stinky,19,1
"Really truly not my favorite. Check-in takes so long that you have to wait in roped off, winding snake line (like at Disney World) just to give your name and get to your room. After a long day of travel that is the last thing I wanted. The front desk staff were also unhelpful-- I had to ask where the gym and the pool were, no one offered that information and the gym is hidden inside the spa (way back), and the pool is randomly on the 6th floor so you'd never find it alone. The lobby has hideous lighting that is constantly changing and made me feel sick while I waited. The room was huge but the space was all wasted-- there was no refrigerator so we threw tons of leftover food away during our stay (not what you want in a city known for food), the television was positioned so that you couldn't watch it from the bed without straining, the decor was hideous and my back hurt every morning when I woke up from the terribly uncomfortable beds. My husband's company booked the room for us but I'd never stay here again even if it was paid for-- the tackiest hotel in the tackiest mall on the tackiest part of the Vegas strip, it just doesn't get any worse than that. The wifi was apparently free but also really really bad-- not fast enough to stream a movie or do work from the room. \n\nThe only reason I thought of giving the place two stars instead of one is because Koi (restaurant on premises) was delicious-- but all of the other food was mediocre at best. The pool also wasn't scenic or particularly clean-looking but the staff was super nice and attentive out there and it was really big so there was plenty of room for guests to relax by the pool without being on top of one another, which was nice but it was just such an ugly pool space. The one staff member working at the gym was nice as well and they gave out free water bottles and apples. The view from the room wasn't so hot so I hope no one paid with that in mind. I'd go elsewhere.",438,0

"This place is AWESOME! Everything was fantastic, from the cute waitress, to the friendly cooks. I ordered the Coconut Chicken with naan, dal, salad, biryani rice and yogurt sauce. My goodness, they really hooked it up. They will make your dish as spicy or mild as you like. The crispy and soft naan is something to experience. Even the condiments were delicious! We will only be in Scottsdale for two more days and we are definitely going back tomorrow. The price is very reasonable for the portion size.",106,4
"Okay, so I have a Pho craving like twice a year...called this place about 9:45p asking to get take out.  Lady told me they close at ten so I told her my order and she didn't want to accept it because she thought I would have gotten there after 10 haha. Denied! \n\nSo, obviously I'm never going there I told myself if they don't want my business...but out of convenience and considering a vegetarian friend we went and it confirmed my prejudice. Waiter told us they do not have a vegetarian broth, which the chef easily took care of after we told him to ask. He didnt know what kind of fish that they would put in a seafood veg soup. Friendly but knew nothing. Food was average. Safe to say I will not be satisfying my random Pho craving here again haha",178,1

"We got to the buffet around 1130am on Sunday for the brunch. The line wasn't too bad, I guess because we got here pretty early. We waited about 15-20 min. The service was good and they were pretty organized.  I thought the food was mediocre. They have a guy that makes an omellete fresh for you, but I've had similar experience at a Marie Calendars. The best thing during the brunch that was even worth mentioning is the herb crusted prime rib.  Other than that the selection is okay, they have salads, pizza, a little bit of Asian cuisine and some fish.  I wasn't a fan of their dessert.  It's not that huge and their dessert is not worth mentioning either; it didn't look that appealing.  The best thing they had was the strawberry and peach sorbet, which was very refreshing. Sorry Bellagio, brunch buffet for $23 sounded good, but the only thing I'd be coming back for is the prime rib.",218,1
"This TJs location seems bigger/better than others. The layout of the store is wider and seems as though it has more inventory.\n\nI did try a new Grab-n-Go salad the other day and am hooked!

Believe there was some quinoa in there also for more substance and protein. :)\n\nFriendly associates and unique/healthy food are always comforting to me. I still don't know why they ring that bell.

"I took my dog here twice (pit bull/lab ret mix) she goes crazy!\nThe idea was right on...to have a dog park like a resort; different sized fenced in areas for dogs, an obstacle course, a LAKE and a place to bathe and even a fake hydrant that spills into a big water bowl.\n\nThere are too many problems with this park:\nA: except for where you have to have your dog on a leash ALL of the grass is dead and non existent,  so every time we'd go she'd be up to her belly in mud.\nB: I've heard too many stories about the lake.  Its infected, disease ridden, stagnant, etc.  At first I didn't want to believe any of those stories because that meant breaking the bad news to my baby (dog), and thats when the tail would come to a stop. :(...\nSO when I saw the doggies hydrant area with trash inside and brown water, the no grass areas where the dogs are able to play (btw no sprinklers set up either) I quickly realized \""this park is not a very clean park-even for dogs.\""  Nope another tactic to get money from tax payers and a seemingly nice place for you pooch until you really start to smell it out for what it is...\nWe wont be back.",281,1
"Great service, Great smell of bread, Free samples, cant go wrong here.\n\nThe one thing that made it one star less than a perfect five was the breads they had on sale made specific to each day. \n\ni was craving the walnut coconut bread (as I saw on the menu). Come to find out that it was only made on tuesdays and sundays. :(\n\nI got another bread to sub for the bread I wanted. Its not the same. Also, I find it weird that they closed the store when they sold out of bread. I thought whoever owned the business should know what their sales are per diem and make enough product for that day.

"This Safeway is nice and is close to my house, but after visiting this weekend I have to stay I am going to stick with Bashas. The prices are definitely higher on my normal items at Safeway. Also, I know Safeway can't really control this, but the vibe is not as friendly. The parking lot was packed, there were grumpy folks looking for spots. This is the same Safeway that my husband was at when a guy and his girlfriend walked up to him and offered him $5 to help get him a hair cut. My husband's hair wasn't even that long (maybe an inch or two). I don't know what it is that draws that type of crowd, but Bashas has a much more home-town feel.",158,1

The pork brisket is the best to try. \n\nService, \n\nGood service in the beginning, but after a while the server stopped coming to us even when I had both of my hands in the air, maybe because I presented 5 pork briskets? ......

"Wow has the Pink Pony changed!  \n\nDecor: 5 star\n\nI remember driving by the old pepto bismol pink building with the giant wood horse.  It looked like a place where people came to play bridge.  The new restaurant front is awesome.  It's completely open to the street with modern touches, but it still keeps alive some Old Town Scottsdale charm.  The decor feels like a happy marriage between Ocean Prime in City North and Olive & Ivy at the Waterfront.\n\nThere are high booths for privacy when sitting inside.  The lighting feels a little museum like with spotlights, so I felt like I was on display a little bit.  There's a warm color palette with a neat all glass wine rack in the back. \n\nService: 4 star\n\nService was great.  Hostess greeted us with a smile and showed us to the table.  They give you an old milk glass full of water to refill yourself.  The drinks came quickly, and the staff was always available.  The pacing was also correct, and they never bothered us towards the end as we were finishing our wine.\n\nThe only dink is that they left the menu's on our table all night which was fine for me.\n\nDrinks: 5 star\n\nThey have a lot of beers on tap.  I was pleasantly surprised they were doing a special draft selection with Goose Island (from my home town of Chicago).  They also had some wines I have never seen at an AZ restaurant.  One of my favorite wineries in Sonoma is Gundlach Bunschu, and they had one of their table cuvee's on the list.\n\nThe mixed drinks looked interesting, but I stuck with beer and wine.\n\nFood: 2 star\n\nFrom what I heard, the menu has been \""dumbed down\"" due to spring training clientelle.  Everything had the old Pink Pony steak house feel on the menu, except for a few appetizers (brats, grilled cheese sliders).\n\nWe ordered scallop crudo, beet salad, spinach and kale ravioli, and debris pizza (duck bacon, pork belly).\n\nThe scallop crudo was by far the best of the bunch.  Beet salad was typical.  The ravioli was very dry and the cheese on top overpowered all the flavors.  If I closed my eyes, the pizza would've tasted like a sausage pizza.\n\nOverall:\n\nI would wrap it up with what my fiance said before we left... \""I'd come back here for a few drinks after work.  The scallops were good though\""\n\nUnfortunately, I put more weight on food.  There are plenty of places around town with great service and scenery to grab a drink.  I'll do a second review again when they change their menu after spring training.",610,2
Excellent food. Great atmosphere. We live close and will definitely dine there again. The reason for the four-star review is they were 15 minutes late in seating us. We were seated outside on the side patio and it was a little crowded. (Lights from the cars in the parking lot were also a little distracting) Other than that everything was perfect. Sam did a good job on this one but there is room for improvement.,89,3
"Just an update. And a warning: I was contacted by corporate. At first I thought great maybe they will redeem themselves. But nope! After giving them all the info they completly missed the point of what took place , offered no compensation , told me it wasn't their policy to do what happened to me and to check with my bank!! Bad move! Though in the end I WAS ONLY charged the amount of my bill. THE RESTRAUNT/SERVER put a HOLD on my credit card for an extra amount of money to guarantee a tip until it could be varified we paid one (cash)..=this happened and was wrong!!!!. TIPS ARE NEVER GUARANTEED!! Unless it is shown on the bill as when there is a large party. I signed for one amount and another amount was held hostage by this RESTRAUNT!! Bad business..",172,0
"I always drive by this place and decided to see what it's all about.  I wasn't hungry, so decided to buy a loaf of sourdough bread.  Granted it was a few days before Christmas, so I guess it was busier than usual.  There were less than 10 people when I came in, but I waited about 10 minutes to pay for my bread.  Maybe I was a little impatient, but if I waited any longer I would've walked out of that place.  In my opinion, the workers were really slow.  I've worked in retail and you never want your customers waiting too long to pay, especially if it's bread!  I'm mean, don't they want my money?  \n\nOn a positive note, the sourdough bread was really good and would probably continue buying my bread there.

I posted a picture, you can see it's a fresh gel mani from the cuticles. Don't waste your money here!

"What! $5.25 lunch special? Soup, eggroll, wonton, then fried rice and entree? You've got to be kidding me right? Sorry, Charlie, but that is correct!\n\nThis sit down Chinese Restaurant is near my school where the majority of teachers get their lunch fix. I joined some of them during a summer planning day. The restaurant is small, but the service is big. You can usually hit or miss with Asian service. Why do I say that? Because I'm Asian. Although they are friendly, smiles all around, and know their repeat customers.\n\nI chose the hot & sour soup. What do I look for in my hot & sour? I'll tell you what I don't like. I don't like watery run down soup. It has to have a level of thickness. It also can't be too hot or sour (obviously). Both flavors need to compliment one another, not overpower. I do like a heavy dose of tofu and veggies as well. As a result, this soup seemed to meet the criteria, and was quite nice to taste.\n\nThe eggroll and wonton were not overly breaded, and the crispiness had a nice crunch that did not get messy. I chose the orange chicken for my entree and it hit the spot. The flavor from the sauce was right on, and it was evenly deep fried to provide a subtle crunch that did not take away from the chicken.\n\nOverall, I like the lunch special and service. I don't want to say typical Chinese food, but they are above average at what they do in regards to service and quality of food. I will definitely be back again and look forward to good Chinese food.",363,3
"I feel as though this place needs a little more love.  First of all, its nice to go to a Chinese restaurant that specializes in Szechuan food.  If you haven't had food from this region of China, it kind of like comfort food.  It tends to be spicy and, yes, a little oily some times.  Most of the spicy dishes are also complimented by the nice floral flavor of ash berry, also know as Szechuan peppercorn.  Some people have complained about oil but when I have not ordered the spicy and hot, the food has been less oily than most places.  Everything I have tried, I have enjoyed.",136,3

"We went here with a group for my girlfriend's birthday and had nothing but great things to say about the place when we left.\n\nUpon arrival everyone on staff new it was her Birthday and promptly wished her a happy birthday before we even sat down. The menus, created just for our party also had her name on them with a celebratory theme. Sure its a small detail but the amount of effort they put in to make her feel special was truly top notch.\n\nOn top of the amazing customer service the food was top notch and  well prepared. I recommend the Filet if your willing to spend the extra coin for it. Easily one of the best I've had in town.\n\nOverall, in case you can't already tell, this place earns its five star rating from me and I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone back here!",179,4

"Came here for lunch on a business trip out to Charlotte, NC.  I'm from California, so I had no idea what to expect when we went here for a quick bite to eat.  \n\nThis place is situated in the middle of a shopping plaza-like setting.  We were seated promptly, however, there were 6 people in our party and we had to squeeze in to a table that normally fits 4 comfortably.  They do have a decent menu with normal lunch items you would find at any chain restaurant.  Wait staff was polite. Food on the other hand was mediocre and a bit on the greasy side.  \n\nOverall it was a fast lunch, nothing really special but also nothing really awful.  I'd suggest though that if you're looking for a nice lunch worth talking about then you should find somewhere else to go.",182,1

"This review is based purely on the venue and not the productions held here. I have seen many shows at Gammage. Recently I have seen War Horse and Beauty and the Beast in the orchestra section which have both been amazing! Gammage itself however is not so amazing. The outside of the building is beautiful and eye catching but the inside not so much. \n\nThe restroom situation alone is enough for any woman to go crazy. Gammage has two restroom locations. One is on the second floor and quite a walk from the orchestra section seats especially when you only have fifteen minutes during intermission and the second location is on the third floor near the top balcony. Once you get to the bathroom, no matter when, before the show, during intermission (is the worst), and after the show, the wait is at least 25 to 30 women waiting, 10 to 15 minutes. Forget having time to purchase a drink or snack. The bathroom itself has only six stalls which are dimly lit (more like you need a flashlight to see anything) and old as can be. Once you are finally done using the facilities and need to dry your hands after washing, good luck with the paper towel line if the dispenser is even working. Bottom line, use the bathroom before and after the show not at Gammage which I know can sometimes be difficult during a 2 to 4 hour show. Note to Gammage - Immediately do a renovation on the bathrooms! Ticket sales will increase as a result!\n\nThe seats are just okay. The performances are usually amazing and it usually does not matter where you sit in that regard but the cushions on seat backs once again could use some renovation. I will continue going to Gammage because it is one of the only locations in Phoenix to host Broadway productions but I do hope that they make some improvements in the near future.",381,1

"\""Do you like Mother Nature?\"" This question came after the check. It was on the heel of a discussion about mountain biking and camping. South Mountain. Camelback. San Francisco Peak. He liked it all. In fact, he liked to talk. He being the owner, I mean. \n\nMy friend and I arrived around 5:30 for dinner. We were greeted right away and shown a table. Our Kirin Lights shortly followed. The sushi menu offered nigiri, sashimi and their roll selection, which included one called \""Phoenix Suns.\"" The owner soon embarked on striking up a conversation with us. His English was somewhat broken, though. I let my friend do the talking. I added, \""We'll trust you\"" when it was decided that we'd let him pick a roll for us and put together a sashimi platter. \n\nWhile we waited, we sampled the miso soup and drank our beer. Soon, a brightly colored roll came to our table. \""Spicy Slim\"" is what we were told it was. We had no idea what it was, until the owner came over later to chat some more. Crab on the inside, tuna on the outside - covered in spicy sauce. Well then. It was pretty tasty, especially with the coating (like small, white crunchy flakes). It got pretty spicy the more you ate. \n\nSoon the sashimi came. We had peppered and seared salmon (yum), extra white tuna, ahi tuna, yellow tail and salmon. Each piece was very good. The sizes were generous, too. The sahsmi came with two small dipping bowls, too. Sort of a mild spicy sauce, an alternative to soy. The sauce was a great complement to the meal. \n\nMy friend wanted more. Man, she can pack it away! So, we ordered some mackeral nigiri and a caterpillar roll. The mackerel was very good, although I thought the rice it laid on was a bit too sticky - hard to chew. The caterpillar roll was good, though. It was your basic eel meets avocado. The eel sauce was sweet without being overly sweet and overpowering the taste of the roll. \n\nOverall, a great meal! The service was also great - although a bit too attentive. Considering we were the only patrons (minus a couple sitting at the sushi bar), they were just waiting around to serve us. In fact, they tried to take our miso soups away twice before we were actually finished. \n\nAlso, there was the chattering - the owner striking up a conversation after we paid, when we are about to get up from our seats. First it was about basketball, since on the big screen I saw that it was about to be Bedlam (Oklahoma State vs. OU). Funny, considering I went to OSU and my friend is a big Sooners fan. I think the owner wanted to see us throw down. Who knows. In any case, basketball talk soon turned to travel (Hawaii was a hot topic) and the outdoors. We gradually weened the conversation to a flutter and left. \n\nAs we were pulling away, my friend said, \""Oh god, he's outside waving to us.\"" It was true. He was outside, alright, bidding us adieu. Some may call that spectacular service. I think that was over doing it a bit much. Yet, what else had he to do? It seems the FBR had devoured most of his dinner patrons. Besides, he did admit that Ichi Ban is more of a hot lunch spot for the surrounding businesses. \n\nAs for the bill, it came to about $100. True, we did order some more expensive fish (like the white tuna), but it was not worth $50 a person. No way, no how. Especially since you felt like you stumbled upon an obscure shopping plaza and into a sushi diner, not a restaurant. (Case in point: They have a seperate counter to take orders for teriyaki rice bowls and the like.) The decor didn't so much bother me, though. It was the extra attention. I guess I just don't like being spoiled (that's one way to look at it). \n\nPlus, the owner is Korean. We know this because they were speaking to each other in another language, and my friend picked up on it. He was Korean alright. She should know. She married one.",921,2
"If I could, I would become a professional gambler. However, I think that would land me homeless and send me straight to divorce court. Needless to say, I enjoy going on over night trips to local casinos. \n\nI stayed here on a Tuesday night, which happened to be my anniversary. My husband and I went to the pool. I really liked the pool bar. Drinks were a little pricey. We ended up only getting one round. It would be nice to see cheaper drinks at the pool.

"Terrible. That sums up my experience here. \n\nFood used to be so good here, back in the Aladdin days. The seafood was fresh and there was lots of it, all different types. Now you are left with crab legs and shrimp; my guess? both from the same distributor that does all the buffets. In other words, flash frozen, not much flavor, ordinary not extraordinary stuff. \n\nThere wasn't one item I ate today that I would consider tasting 'good'. Not excellent, just 'good'. That's how far my standards have fallen here. The prime rib piece that I got was well done. I would say it once had a chance at good flavor, but not when it reached that temperature. The sushi consisted of three types all stacked on top of it other in one tray. Other than that, everything I ate, I literally took one bite of and then stopped. Even my 5 year old son, who loves desserts, stopped after one bite of his creme brulee and fruit tart. He didn't like either. Doesn't that sum it up? And I haven't started with my two major complaints. First is the price. My son, who again is 5, costs a whopping $19.99. That is highway robbery. Our dinners costs $36.99. Again a huge gouge fest. This buffet, in terms of quality and taste, I wouldn't pay more than $9.99.\n\nAnd since the line was so long, they had an upstairs line, then the escalator, then it continues to a downstairs line. My cousin was waiting in line for us, and she had gotten to the downstairs part. The idiot who was controlling the top of the escalator wouldn't let me pass, even though my cousin was downstairs. In fact he didn't let many people pass, who's families were already in the downstairs line. Do people really f you over so much that you are a dick to all the families? Do you think I'm trying to bs you, as I am pushing my aunt in her wheelchair? Did you think the wheelchair was fake too so I can get some sympathy from you and try to steal my place in the front of the line? \n\nAs I write a letter to corporate to complain about this establishment, I will now write the same here on yelp. I will never again visit this buffet, and I would advise any living soul, for as long as I live, never ever come here.",529,0
"Hands down, best STEAK and Egg place in Vegas. Wayy better than buffalo bills! I heard about this place from my roommate and decided to try it. I am not really sure if I like it because of the price but this is my go to steak and eggs place in Vegas.",60,3
"Holy Crap they've done a lot with this place! Having grown up in this neighborhood, I remember this building being Katz deli. Man it is so different from the yellow brick deli in my memory.\n\nOf course we ordered the bruschetta: \nfig, mascarpone, and prosciutto- so good! I love sweetish/savory combos and the rich, creamy mascarpone was the perfect compliment.\nWarm artichoke- good\nsalami and pesto- really good, simple. I really like their pesto\ntomato, basil, mozzarella- really nice, classic. The sea salt very complimentary, gives a pop of flavor\n\nI ordered the autostata panini on focaccia. Oh how I love Italian deli meats. So good. Huge portion. I took half home and it was still so good for lunch the next day. I tied my friend's nine iron and it was also really good. \n\nAll in all very good!",200,4
"The sexy Hubby and I stopped by late at night for some sweets, and oh man it was packed, like I couldn't get to where I needed to order or get sugar for my coffee... I really did not like the setup, but it was cool lookin... I liked the chocolate croissant, the cheese danish and nutella brioche a lot, the coffee was ok, the price was steep, but to be expected.  I was not wowwed though, it wasn't something more amazing or wonderful that any other I have had, and the service was nice, but pooly organized, I was ignored for a long time...",129,2
"Slightly overrated, but pretty good stuff. The food and beer is expensive for the C-U. Better than Giordanos. Get there early and be prepared to wait b/c it is popular and can get very crowded, especially on fridays.",53,3
"First Friday had certainly gone downhill in the past six months.  It was as if they took a giant homeless shelter put up a bunch of booths to sell bottle caps and keychains disguised as art, and only invited people from all of the nearby trailer parks to attend.  The entertainment appeared to have come from a grammar school talent show.  What a disappointment!!",74,0
Beautiful park!,4,4
"I had gone to LA last year and was pretty bummed I didnt get to visit the famous Pink's Hot Dogs.  So naturally, I was pretty excited when I realized they had a Pink's in Planet Hollywood, where I was staying.\n\nCheese fries: AWESOME\nI had the Showgirl dog and I forgot the name of the dog my boyfriend had, but I liked his better even though they were both yummy. His had jalapenos, all I remember. Sorry guys! LOL. My only complaint is that they put TOO much of the condiments on to the point where it took me a few minutes to strategize my game plan on how to actually eat the thing :)\n\nI definitely recommend a trip to Pink's!",157,3
"Awesome new spot in Old Town! The retro feel in this Mexican restaurant was super unique. Patio seating with a fireplace is always an added bonus in AZ. The margaritas were exceptional. We had the traditional poke appetizer, good for a couple people. For dinner we tried the braised pineapple pork bowl and the shrimp tacos. Outstanding! They have a nice selection of homemade salsa/dressings to try with your meals, too. Really enjoyed this place and will definitely be back soon!",98,4
"Every year we choose a different hotel to stay at during our visit to Vegas, unfortunately we chose Flamingo. We stayed at the Flamingo three nights in august and the hotel gave us one of there remodeled rooms on the 25th floor. Im not going to complain the rooms were very nice (modern) the bathroom was very spacious, but the bathroom door was a sliding door that did not lock so if your sharing a room you have to make sure there is no one in the bathroom. The flamingo pool is ok, they have a pool for kids which has a slide and a pool for 21+ which has a cave (GO Pool) while in the GO pool I saw vomit in the pool and a man hurl while he was walking through which I considered a huge health hazard! The flamingo food court was under remodeling so the only thing open was the caf\u00e9 which didn't really have much and closed early. My biggest pet peeve with this hotel was the parking!!!! the first two floors are valet parking and the third floor was only for Hertz rental cars, we spent an hour looking for parking till we finally gave up and decided to go to the valet, once were down there's a sign that said valet parking full! How is this possible the Wynn hotel has there own staff parking and yet guests at the flamingo don't have a place to park there car! The parking lot at the flamingo is just disgusting, no parking, the elevator gets stuck at times so you have to carry your heavy luggage down flights of stairs, just terrible! Either they remodel the entire place or tear it down because that kind of hotel does not belong on the strip.",341,1
"We had a large group (14) or so.  I was really appreciative that the restaurant was willing to accomodate a large group and our server even split the checks that evening.  The first item (guacamole uniquo) which had guac and crab was so salty it had to be sent back.  The second order came out beautifuly and was delicious.  The rest of the entrees seemed hit or miss.  A girlfriend had to send back a glass of one twice since both glasses had turned.  The burger was tasty.  I am mixed on the tacos which seem pricey (three tacos without any accompanyments left many of us hungry).  The flatbreads were tasty but overly cheesed, and tended to be oily.  I'm still wanting to try out their brunch which looks tasty.  \nService was not great.  To be fair, we were a large party and there was another realy large party on the patio, but we would put in orders and wait and wait and wait about 20 minutes before someone checked in on us only to find that our drink orders hadn't been put into the bar.\nI'm excited to have this addition to the neighborhood but probably won't go back for dinner for another few months.",263,1
"I used to love this place. I've been here quite a few times over the past year or so. Quality has gone down and service always bad. I've yet to have my water refilled here, ever. You have to flag someone down if you want a to go box, extras, a napkin, anything. .. Sometimes I've been ignored. I went recently and the soup was cold, broth not as great as it's been and my meat looked old and had spots??? On it.... There was also something in identifiable in the soup. I always order the same kind so not sure what was up. I'm very disappointed and may just find a better place from now on.",145,1
"Kanpai hides it's light under a bushel, being such an unassuming little restaurant tucked away on Grindlay Street.\n\nI was immediately welcomed by, what must be, the friendliest waiting staff in town. Combined with the sleek and stylish interior it proved to be a very relaxing and enjoyable place to be. The tables are all set with chopsticks on little marble rests, soy sauce in miniature kettles and little dipping bowls dotted around. Pretty *and* functional.\n\nNow the important bit; the food. I have been binging on all things raw and seafood-y recently and Kanpai does this to the highest standard in Edinburgh. Not only that, it easily compares to some of the best in the UK.\n\nI had surf clam sashimi, sashimi salad, aubergine in a sweet miso sauce, wakame salad and miso soup. The surf clams were a first for me and I will definitely order them again next time. They were reassuringly fresh, juicy and sweet . Elegantly served in a bowl over crushed ice (with a cute little bamboo ice scoop to boot) with a flower (my botanical knowledge fails me as I have no idea what it was or if it was edible and I didn't have the courage to try it) Likewise, the sashimi salad consisted of a fresh and tasty mix of tuna, salmon, octopus and scallop and gorgeous little balls of salmon roe. All served atop a crisp radish and cucumber salad, with a sesame and soy dip. The wakame was no less crisp and fresh, dressed in sesame oil. The dark horse of the table was the aubergine in sweet miso sauce. I don't like aubergines but this is now the exception to the rule. It was creamy, crispy and very more-ish. Very sweet, though, and got a bit sickly after a while.\n\nKanpai, reassuringly, doesn't mess about with fusion cooking, anything elaborate or experimental. Its menu is streamlined to offer the best sushi, sashimi and Japanese food it can. Which also happens to be the best in Edinburgh.",431,3
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!\n\nThe coolest place to shop in the Valley.  Very Rockabilly centric which is waaaay cool by me.\n\nAnd thank's to Thomas I was able to buy me some \""Jesus hates it when you smoke\"" ashtrays!  Don't walk but run to this place!!!",71,4
"I'll start off like this, there was a short time to wait, the atmosphere was nice, and if you are on a date the set you up with this amazing 1 pizza and a bottle or wine/pitcher of beer deal for $35 AND its good pizza, and I don't like pizza but it was delicious.  The ONLY drawback is the extremely small parking lot, part of it which is shared with the neighboring bar, so try not to be too fashionable and late or you'll be walking a country mile.",112,3
"What a crazy trip. Got the chance to stay in Encore for three nights, we did most of the partying within the resort. Room is fairly good, not the best have seen. Area is clean and neat. The only downside is the price.... one order of crab leg with the room service is $186~~ and we forgot to put the room service sign up and they never came in and clean the room, after three days, the whole room smells like crab. We literally clean out the freezer (alcohol) looking forward to come back again for a better experience. P.S. The view of the room is really nice, we stayed in 3642.",139,2
"I was really really torn on whether to give H&H 3 or 4 stars!!  \n\nThe cocktails are standard quality craft cocktails, but without any frills and nothing particularly spectacular about it.\n\nThe atmosphere/decor is just ok.  It's very bare and, due to the lack of crowd, empty feeling.  I suppose we did go out for drinks at around 8 on a Sunday evening, but I mean, who doesn't do that? right? :p \n\nService was pretty average as well.  There was only one bartender/staff, but it was sufficient for the small number of people.  He also didn't seem too interested in telling us more about the cocktails and basically told us all the cocktails were great.\n\nIn the end, we choose the Agnatha & Anni and the August 21st, 1959.  I really liked my Agnatha.  Crisp, tart, strong.  I didn't like all the tiny ice bits in it though, but that's easily remedied as the ice melts.  The August 21st was ok.  I'm not a fan of smoky flavored drinks, but if you are, this one would be a good choice.\n\nOverall, I would come back again because it's just too convenient.  Plenty of street parking, closely located, solid cocktails, and no worries about finding a table.",307,2
"Don't waste your time going there. I generally couldn't care less about the price of food in a restaurant but this was the most overpriced streak I've had in my life. I could do better in 10 min at home with costco steak.\n\nThe entrees weren't good either.\n\nEveryone at the table is disappointed with their food. The service is worth a C- note. They didn't even know how to price their off menu items they were offering. There is clearly a lack of training.\n\nTerrible, terrible. But hey, at least we're laughing about it.",134,0
"Wow... Talk about a great service and quality of work. I use these guys for all my dry cleaning and alteration services.  I would strongly recommend trying theses guys for your dry-cleaning needs. Guarantee you won't be dissatisfied......2001 team, keep up the great work!!!",61,4
"Okay, I lovvvvveeeee chipotle! And I been to this location twice. Most of the staff are nice but that dang short cashier girl is SO rude. She has an attitude every time or just hates her job, i don't know. But I work in the restaurant industry and even if I'm in a bad mood I don't act like that. I try to avoid this location just because of her. Otherwise food is always yummy!!",96,1
"I have to agree with the other users; therefore, not too much more to add.\n\nLove the staff, they're really friendly. I also love the fact they carry items from the \""Fred & Friends\"" line.\n\nParking can be \""interesting\"", as they share a lot with Thai Taste.\n\nI'm happy to purchase things here, since it's a local business.",87,3
"One of the more disappointing wrap experience that I've had. \nI got the lamb wrap. Barely any meat, mostly pita and lettuce. No distinct flavor. \nOrdered for pick up and told them that I was going to pick it up at noon, when I got there it was waiting for me, but it was luke warm at best, so my guess is that it's been sitting on the counter for 45 minutes. The waitress was short and impolite on the phone, and her demeanor in person wasn't that great either.\nCosts over $8 with tax and doesn't even come with a side. \nIf I wanted a bland luke warm sandwich, I would have gone to Subway and paid less. \nNot worth it for the prices that they charge. \n\nThe only positive, the lamb was pretty tender; the two tiny pieces that I actually tasted in my sandwich.",192,1
Let me start by saying I love this place! Why 2 stars? Because the people who answer the phone are as dumb as dumb and rude as rude can be! It cost you you a catering order today! Wasn't just one it was 2 different people 2 separate calls!,60,1
A nice selection of his own wines and others. Food was fantastic!   Had the stuffed mushrooms and pulled peek sliders. Yummy!  And everyone was very friendly!   Great combination. . Loved the atmosphere!,43,3
"Well that was a disappointment. We used to dine here often when they first opened. Then we ventured off to other options. (Dave's) The service was always great. Well it has changed. We are Passport members and received a coupon for a Cheeseburger & beer for $10 on Tax Tuesday only. The husband called ahead and asked if we could use the coupons for our non-drinking members but still have the beers for us. He was assured they were flexible with coupon. The fine print said: one coupon per person. So after a 20 minute wait to sit, our waitress arrives and tells us no that won't work with the coupons. We order drinks and try not be annoyed. We decide on three cheeseburgers and pizza. Then the waitress returns (without the drinks) and says the manager said the coupon deal will work. Oh well we've decided differently. So we order and wait for our beers.....................................................................and wait..............................................................oh here they are. Warm. No apology just 'here you go'. Then we wait..................................................................................................and get our dinner. The WAITRESS realizes we have no utensils or napkins. So we wait.............................................but I see some on a clean table inside, I walk in and take them off the table. As I'm walking out I run into her she says \""oh, sorry\"". So I finally dig in and it's so blah, we ordering the beef medium and it was overcooked very charred on the outside with a slice of cheddar, a bit of shredded lettuce, slice of tomato, on a big bun. I had garlic fries as they used to be so good. These were cold, greasy and mushy. The waitress never came by to ask how the meal was. But she finally showed up and stated \""you are welcome to one more beer would you like it\""? Yes, and then we ............you guessed it! WAIT..........................................................................................................................................................................................Sigh. She finally brought it and it was a least cold this time. Then we were done and yes, we waited and waited and waited for the check. Until we got up and could have left but we went inside and ....waited. The I think the manager went and found it for us. So dear waitress, we are good tippers even for unspecial service but never, never for complete disregard for any customer service. \nI can't see us going back any time in the near future.",518,1
"This particular RA has confused the difference between an appetizer and an entree. I ordered both an app and an entree. The entree comes out with nary an app in sight. The explanations ( yes multiple) 1) this app takes longer than entrees to cook ( then why is it on the \""starter\"" menu???) and the other is \"" we serve family style so we bring things out when they are ready\"". Really ? It doesn't say that on the menu which CLEARLY has \""starters\"" and main dishes delineated. That's just lazy restaurant operations.",119,1
"Can I just say WOW! An upscale looking and trendy restaurant without the pretentious and price of one. \n\nI had almost lost all hope in finding a great restaurant in this side of the valley (Arrowhead), and NoRTH really swept me off my feet. The sangria is worth ordering; with the blend of raspberries, blueberries and blackberries- tastes just like juice! The warm + soft bread with their tomato dip is addicting, I couldn't stop eating it even after they brought out the roasted artichoke as our appetizer. \n\nOur dishes were delicious- the moist salmon was cooked perfectly atop a bed of roasted squash and spinach in a light creamy sauce, while my friend's baked ziti bolognese looked just as good as it tasted. We topped off the night with the panna cotta, truly the cherry on top of a wondrous meal. \n\nIf you're looking to impress your friends without breaking the bank or wasting gas driving to Scottsdale, I highly recommend NoRTH. Word on the street is their happy hour is pretty bomb, I will be back..",228,4
Stopped by for lunch with friends from work.  \n\nI had the Jamaican jerk chicken.    The chicken was very flavorful.   The festivals were every bit as good as those I had in Jamaica.\n\nThe food was slow to arrive.  If you are going for lunch and are on a tight schedule this is not the place unless you arrive early enough for the buffet.\n\nThe price was high for the serving size.  Overall it was a nice change from the usual lunch fare.,106,1
"The pros: The steaks were of good quality, our server was very well informed, cocktail and wine list was fantastic and the  ambiance was sexy and hip.  \n\nThe cons: The brussel sprouts were greasy and disgusting.  The large 2 inch pieces of fat were rather unappetizing, the whipped potatoes looked like soup, the loaded baked potato was unique- not in a good way and the desserts were butter overkill. \n\nI expected more from Chef Ramsay.  I felt like this was less of a gourmet culinary experience and more of a mainstream financial tourist trap.",124,2
Great time and atmosphere. Had a nice table on the patio. Our waiter Chris gave us some great recommendations. The scallops were absolutely divine! As were the braised short ribs. Don't miss the mussels. They came in this light creamy broth that was OMG-good when dipped with the toasted bread. Wow!,65,4
I thought that the beef panang was a little weak. The soup needed more tamarin. Still the lunch special was ok,26,2
"Really good tortas but not the best, service was fast and I will definitely be back.",19,3
"I have just discovered yet another reason to love Tami's. I recently tried their Shelack (sp), which instead of being just a regular polish is a gel, it does require more work to apply as they must first manicure (35$ me thinks), but the serious bonus is that once applied it dries instantly (I am use to paying before getting polished to avoid messing up whilst rustling through the purse to get wallet), but Jenni (another of my faves there said. \""don't worry you will see dries fast\""), and so it did.  The look is awsome cause it has a very high sheen, and remains looking brand spankin new for up to 3 weeks.  My last time was a good 15 days but my nails grow really quickly so you can see the gap, I have done neutral color,  and bright red and am planning on french manicure for the next one, so if you like me have a busy schedule and are not particularly carefull (as in I garden and serve food so my hands are constantly in water), this is a great solution to keeping your nails pretty and polished.",232,4
"Since I had some poor customer service experiences at Cartel, they've really made an effort to improve. There is still some snark, but I haven't seen any rudeness in a long time. They're making a definite effort to educate or work with customers.\n\nTheir coffee has always been top notch, and if they continue to develop the service side of the equation they are going to be solidly one of the best coffee shops in town.",95,3
"Nothing special. Awkward line set up if you just want an ice cream cone.  Would be nice if they had line markers so everyone didn't block the door. Also would be cool if you could just pay at the counter instead of then having to wait for the cashier. Anyway, just a place to stop in downtown Scottsdale which is kind of on the lame side anyway. IMO.",80,1
"Oh my gosh..  This restaurant is amazing.  Love the patio and the atmosphere of the restaurant.  The blue corn tortillas are totally yum.  (Mouthwatering just thinking about it.).  They have great margaritas and menu. \n\nIf you have not been here, go like NOW!!! If you are ever in the Phoenix area, you need to try this place out.\n\nIt is a casual place with a higher end price (otherwise if you are on a limited budget, this is a special occasion place).",111,4
"When we relocated to Las Vegas, I read many reviews of veterinarian clinics around town. Dr Mauro/Haven Animal Hospital came highly recommended on Yelp so I gave them a try. I feel compelled to write this review, in order to pass along my experiences and possibly help someone find a quality vet for their furry kids. \n\nDr Mauro is the most thorough, thoughtful and compassionate veterinarian I have ever met. Being an animal owner for my entire adult life, I've had my share of dealings with many vets in a number of states. She and her staff have taken wonderful care my animals (a dog, Mischka, and a cat, Boo). From the amount of time the doctor spends examining the animal to talking about treatments and/or overall health care, I'm amazed she has time left in the day to eat a meal!\n\nRecently, Mischka was having issues and I took her to see Dr Mauro. It was decided that the dog need to see a specialist, which Dr Mauro recommended. The care for my dog did not stop there. When Mischka needed special meds over at the specialty vet and I could not make the pick up and drop off myself, arrangements were made to transport the needed medication. (Thank you, Heather). This truly was above and beyond what is expected of a veterinarian clinic. This is THE place to take your animals. Proficient, empathetic and gentle, Dr Mauro and her staff are a committed team in caring for animals. Thanks, Dr Mauro!",306,4
We had a great experience with Kristi's food tour.......13+ co-workers and a great time had by all.  Learned about Charlotte as a city and new cuisines.  Outstanding experience; would highly recommend!!,47,4
"I recently discovered this place while seeking out a place to have lunch while working in downtown Phoenix. Featured on an instant redeemable coupon app on my phone I decided to give the little guys a chance. Although slightly more expensive than a Mickey D's, its worth it. I got the \""Frankenburger\"" which I believe was invented for shock value more than anything. It's a standard hamburger with the usual condiments but where it takes on a life of its own is the generous addition of ham. Not quite a cold cut, not quite a carver's select, but something in between. The whole thing is sandwiched between a bun (top AND bottom) that has been sliced and stuffed with with cheese. For a dollar more, you can order a half order of the self-proclaimed \""Best\"" fries which is a sufficient helping of freshly sliced potato, fried and salted. Tasty, but being stuck in a Styrofoam to go box left them limp. I also got a Bean & Cheese burrito because they do claim to be a Latin American restaurant. I was too full after my burger, but by the looks of it, it could give any of the local \""Bertos\"" a run for their money.",251,3
"Had a great meal here in Jan 2012, but our return visit this year was disappointing.  No standout dishes, nothing memorable, nothing great.  Whereas the year before we walked away totally satisfied on every level, this time out was just a letdown.\n\nAlso, the bartender did nothing but try to push stuff down our throat.  I've never had such an aggressive server at any establishment, made us feel like we were being \""sold to\"" -- at dinner!?!\n\nThat said, some clever dishes, and they serve nicely sized portions.  Perhaps we came on an off-night?  Only gave it the 2nd star due to memory of the first visit.  Proceed at your own risk.",156,1
"If you're eating here because you've never been to Chase Stadium, walk in, see the stadium, take your picture and get the hell out.  I just saved you about two hours of frustration. You are welcome.  Or you can dine here, like my wife and I regrettably did.  We walked in, and requested to sit by the window... They told us it would be five minutes so we told them no problem at all.  We sat at the bar for 10 minutes, and though the bartender did wave at us, he never took our order.  Then the manager finally came and sat us at a regular table.  I told him we had been waiting for the table with a view, and it was almost as if I had asked him for his social security number.  He fumbled his words, and hesitantly spit out the words \""I have a waiting list\""... There were three empty tables and the restaurant was not full AND THEY DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS! So...WTF???  So we waited a bit longer and finally the nervous un assertive manager found us a table.  Cool...now we have been seated and decided to leave that little first impression behind us.  that's when we met our waitress.  Literally had to tell her every aspect of her job, step by step.  It was like we were training her on her first day of a waitress.  I literally would have gotten my food faster if I was waiting in line for a dodger dog on opening day....and only one hotdog stand was open.",323,0
"It looks like I am not alone...I absolutely LOVE this place!  I have purchased many unique items here and stop in every time I am in the neighborhood.  The staff is very helpful - have helped me ship items to my other home in Dallas too.  The merchandise is ever changing and very reasonably priced.  For anyone that loves France or Paris, you must stop in and take yourself away...really feels like you have stepped into an antique store in France.",96,4
"I really wanted to give them a good review based on the facts that so many yelpers love them but I just couldn't get myself to do it.  After the first bite of their seafood pancake, I knew my expectations were too high for this place.  The pancake was bland and it tasted more like an egg fooyoung (sp?) than a korean pancake.  It was soooo thick!  I also ordered their beef sondoobu but they gave me the yook kae jang instead.  Again, very bland with lots of spice (I liked the spice).  I'll stick to my regular korean spot on the southwest side and chinatown.",136,1
I have been here for three times. never get disappointed by the food. the fried chicken is a must try.,24,3
Came here for dinner with a rather large group of 12 but the waiters kept forgetting things we ordered such as not bringing my friend's beer that we eventually had to cancel and not bringing half of our group's dinner. Overall the ambiance is fun an the food is good. I highly suggest you get the catfish sandwich,67,1
L'ambiance \u00e9tait correct . Le syst\u00e8me  ne bogue pas. Il n'y a pas une une grande s\u00e9lection menu si on veut boire ou manger et il n'y a pas assez de choix de chanson. Il faut payer vers la fin . Nous pouvons avoir de  mauvaise surprise car  par rapport au temps qu'on est rest\u00e9 a chant\u00e9 . Il  faut  vraiment  surveiller  notre  temps  car  cela  devient  vraiment  cher  .,136,2
"Wow. So they were open on Thanksgiving which was awesome. However, the food was meh. There were a few vege options, the food tasted mediocre. I would not eat here again if my life depended on it. There is so much better (like Sawad). The wall next to our table needed work - the corner was so banged up, the drywall was was coming off. There were mysterious brown stains on the wall next to me, hanging dust lines from the ceiling (have you ever been to First Ave in Minneapolis? Yea, it was like that) and it was just dirty inside. The table cloths under the glass were also stained. Save your money and go elsewhere.",138,0
Had my car worked on for multiple issues.  Bob was my mechanic.  He flushed my transmission and replaced my fuel pump.  It's an older shop but the guys are very friendly and the owner Mark is personable.  A customer of mine recommended Milford to me and I'm glad I used them.  I'll be next taking my Suburban for some service!,78,4
"What the hell happened to this place!? Man, what a dump it has become. The service is absolutely awful. It was freezing in there the entire time, so much, that I had to wear my jacket for the painful hour I was in there. Our drinks came out about 20 minutes after we ordered them. Our appetizer came out first and we had A)No drinks B)No water C)No silverware. You would have thought it was our waitress' first night on the job - it was terrible. I will not be going back any time soon. And seriously, fix your decorations! They look like crap and they're falling apart. PS, the food was not great either. Such a bummer, I used to like this place.",154,1
"I've been to Uncle Sal's for both lunch and dinner, and have never been disappointed. The food has always been great, as well as the service. The place has been around for a long time, and through several owners, but you have to give the place credit for being owned at one time by the wife of John Gotti. Not many out-of-towners may know that after Gotti testified against the mob, he was placed into the witness protection program and relocated to Tempe. \n\nUncle Sal's is a little difficult to locate (as are most mob hangouts). It's located in an unassuming strip mall, which doesn't add to the credibility of the restaurant, but Sal's is an exception. I've taken family, friends and friends of friends to Sal's and everyone loved it.",177,3
Luxurious as  a YMCA in the 80's. Pool has low water level and too warm. Shower backed up. \nObviously I am motivated to get a workout in spite of the grunge.,44,1
Wow-I am writing this review because I have had a lot of frusterations at this location-mainly is just the pharamacy.  I only go to this location and gave it a star because it is conviently located and they have a drive thru that stays open fairly late.  I often debate whether or not to find a new location though... \n\nI have been going to this pharmacy location for several months and it seems to me that all of the pharmacy people are very short tempered-I don't understand why they all seem to have bad attitudes???  Something about what's going on with the staff in the pharmacy is not right.  I've had to go inside and complain to the manager it was so bad..he told me the day that I complained that I was the 3rd person to complain that day...shocking!!!  I wonder how many complaints they got the rest of that day or any other day for that matter...I went back probably a week later and their bad attitudes still persist..\n\nUnless you know exactly what you want and are ready for a quick in and out-double charge on your visa card at the drive thru pharamcy-I don't recommend filling scripts here on a regular basis!,261,0
Carls air conditioning left my family in the cold. I can say they were on time but the technician had a difficult time figuring out why my heat wouldn't  turn on.  He spent over 1 hour and said it was a switch. That wasn't the problem as that night the temps dropped and the heat didn't work. We have two children's bedrooms that are freezing and our master bedroom.  They came back the next day which was on a Saturday and the technician spend over 2 hours to finally tells us it was the board that needed to be replaced. Ok great we'll it's a Saturday and we can't get the part. We'll now my family will be sleeping in the cold for 3 days. Why come on a Saturday if you can't fix anything.  The manager was rude and didn't care that my family had to sleep in the cold. I will never use Carls again.,197,0

"The roomie drags me to Hard Rock to check out the new poker room.  Haven't been to HR in several months - a frickin' nightmare trying to figure out where to park ( finally opted for valet )\n\nafter a few hours of craps and poker ( wtf is the deal with paying a $1 to change out one of your hole cards ?!?! ), we opt on some din-din at Pink Taco.  I seem to recall eating at a pink taco in Scottsdale, i assume related.\n\norder a hornitos margie on the rocks ( $9.50 ) carnitas platter ( i believe $15 ) guacamole ($7 ).  roomie gets the shrimp taco platter $12.75\n\nthe chips with the 2 salsas - decent.  the guac - ehhh, a little strong on onion but ok.  The carnitas were good - i prefer carnitas that is simply the salty  roasted pork  variety with no sauce and then i'll add the salsa when i rolled it up in the tortilla.  this had a sauce and the pork was in chunks as opposed to shredded.  it was still tasty.\n\nthe shrimp tacos - very average.  coated shrimp, a little too greasy.\n\noverall, i liked the place.  if i'm in the HR and want a quick bite, this place is worth a visit.\n\ntotal bill ( incl 2 margies and a virgin strawberry daiquiri for the roomie ) \n\n$61",327,2
"Horrible! I was hungry for a green chili burro and remembered this place was right off the freeway. Pull up to the drive thru window and see a sign saying, \"" 50 cent charge for debit credit\"", no big deal as im hungry. The lady opens the window and i see flys creepin out. I counted at least a dozen, which prompted me to leave but again i was hungry so i decided to stick around. \n\nI get my burro and to my surprise its heavy! Im thinkin ahh yea bout to grub. First bite into it and all i get is rice!  Not good rice but rice thats bland as all hell. Who puts rice in a green chili burro?!?! I unwrap it and all there is is rice, beans and shredded beef... no green chili... how is this even called a green chili burro with no chili..\n\nIm leaving one star for the fact that..\n  Tons of Flys were present inside the building\n Rice was bland and overcooked\nMeat was flavorless\n No green chili!\n\nOn a brighter note the beans and tortilla were pretty good.. but not $6.51 good..

This place has gone downhill since AMC took it over.   They run a ridiculous amount of advertising before the movie.  No thanks.   The popcorn is not very good anymore and I hate to have to add butter and salt after they scoop it up.   It is impossible to do this way.   They used to do this while they set it up for you.   No longer done here.   Seating is still ok but we will be going elsewhere from now on.\nSome nice staff though.,103,0
I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody unless you like getting the stomach pump in the hospital and the shits for a week first time and last time I Went To That hole I had the curry goat with rice lunch special  their were more bones and fat then meat in the dish. Then the meat was very dry and very oily and the rice had a fishy aftertaste and the vegetables were semi frozen in the sauce. Never again .,87,0

"I've been anxiously waiting for Pink Box to open since it's close to my office.  Sure enough, they opened while I was out of the country and I made coming here my top priority as soon as I got back.\n\nThey're open at 6am and today I got a cup of Pink Box Blend coffee, Fat Elvis, Chocolate-filled, Raspberry-filled and Campfire Smores doughnuts.  I liked them all and I love how they have the classic flavors and also unique ones.  My favorite is the Campfire Smores doughnut - it has blow-torched marshmallows, chocolate and graham cracker crumbs on top.  I was worried that it'll be too sweet but it wasn't.  The Fat Elvis has chocolate, caramelized banana on top and peanut butter inside.\n\nYou can get a dozen doughnuts for $8.50 and a cup of coffee for $1.50!\n\nI wish they would come up with other flavors too like green tea doughnuts!  I'm all for supporting local businesses and I'm hoping they would reach Top Pot Doughnuts is to Seattle, Pink Box is to Las Vegas status.  Just add a few more flavors and coffee options.",258,3

"We found this place on a different website. Urbanspoon. It was listed as new and reviewed very well.\nCame here for lunch with Hubbie and the fabulous Shirley Martin. Shirley had chicken tacos with rice and beans, and said it was good, more food the she could eat. Garry had chick a chick a boom boom. He said it was delicious, spicey and made his nose run. I had the light combo. Just right. ( no rice and beans)\nAshton was our waiter and he made us feel very welcome, he was attentive, but not pushy. He clerked on our food and offered us dessert, carefully describing some wonderful selections.\nYou should give them a try.",146,4
"so many times driving by this place.....and each time thinking this place seems silly...who would have a giant face on the front of thier business staring down motorists?\n\nI guess when your food is that ridiculously good, go ahead and post whatever you want on your business!!\n\nMy recomendation for this place is not only because it is huge, has a beautiful interior and super friendly staff--no, no--the food is damn good.\n\nI went for breakfast and ordered a pork machaca (an egg scramble) which came with rice, beans and freshly made tortillas along with a larger than life horchata for around $10. \n\nMy significant other had the Huevos con Chorizo...and that too was dynamite.\n\nI know I'll return to Henderson in September and will definitely stop by this place again for my Mexican fix!!",184,4

"Yum. Yum. Yum. I just got back from a trip to Hawaii a few weeks ago and have been craving Hawaiian food. I had heard about this place awhile ago so I was hoping could cure my tastebud's island blues. I'm not even kidding, this place was just as good if not better than some of the places I tried in Honolulu. Mahalo Mai Island Grill, you made this mainlander's day.\n\nThey are only open for lunch (too bad) and it was packed! I thought maybe because ASU is on winter break it might not be as busy but I was wrong. The place is tiny - only 4 tables inside that barely seat 3 and a couple tables outside.\n\nI had the grilled mahi-mahi. Each order comes with a scoop of rice, a scoop of mac salad, and some lettuce under the meat. The fish was very tasty, not dry at all, and the serving was two decent sized pieces. The rice was a tad bit mushy but still good. The mac salad was delish! It had almost a sweetness to it that balanced the saltiness of the rest of the food.\n\nMai Island also serves Hawaiian Sun drinks which I have not seen anywhere else so you can enjoy guava juice or other tropical juices with your meal.\n\nSomeone else had mentioned that they had spam musubi. I didn't see it on the menu so either they don't serve it anymore or it's a special off menu item.\n\nI will most definitely be returning to Mai Island Grill. I can't wait to try the Loco Moco! I just wish they were open on weekends!!",349,4
"The place was fun, the DJ was good...but the staff are jerks.  Someone stepped on my foot, and it started bleeding everywhere (a surprising amount of blood, considering it was my toe), and instead of being accommodating, they hassled us about leaving through the closest exit, since that was the front door.  They all just took turns looking at my bleeding foot with their flashlights.  Finally, after some convincing, they let me and boyfriend out the front, but made my other 2 friends walk through the entire club to get to the normal exit.  Lame!",120,0
"I went here today for lunch with some friends to celebrate the end of our first year of grad school (yay!). The place has a nice atmosphere, and it was nice sitting outside, especially on such a nice day like today was. This place was really busy when we got there today at around 11:45. One of my friends got a burger and said it was pretty good, another got a salmon sandwich which she likes a lot, another got the grilled chicken beer bread sandwich, but she didn't care for it. I tried hers and I thought it was good, although a bit bland. I ordered a special, the BBQ chicken beer bread sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was good, it had chipotle bbq sauce, chicken, cheddar, and fried onion strings. The onion strings really made the sandwich (well, more like a wrap...but whatever). I got the balsamic dressing, and it was really good. It was probably the best thing we got. At the end we all split the stout tiramisu. This was pretty good, but I like the classic better. It is tiramisu made with chocolate mascarpone and with stout beer. I couldn't taste the stout much after the first couple bites, the chocolate took over. I would definitely come back, as it was decent, and they have beer and whatnot, but it wasn't the best place ever, just alright.",287,2
"A bar and restaurant opened at Tempe Marketplace that differentiates itself from the typical outdoor mall chains-Thirsty Lion Pub and Grill, the first location in Arizona with only two additional ones in Oregon. The Thirsty Lion is populated with sexy female servers in cute outfits and has an extensive menu of pub fare and 52 draft beers. \n\nI had soup and salad for lunch, with a garden salad and beer cheese soup ($8.95). This was my first time trying this kind of soup, and while it was probably made well, the beer taste was a little overwhelming for me. Don't order this unless you're a huge fan of beer.\n\nMy salad was great and came with cucumber, carrot, red pepper, onion and croutons. The portion was generous, and the greens were leafy, and as far as soup and salad at sports bars go, this combo was one of the best I've had based on the portion and ingredients.\n\nMy pal tried the Southwest Smoked Chicken Salad ($11.95), which was also an enormous portion and looked mighty tasty.\n\nThere were a ton of other menu items that made me salivate, and I wish I could have tried them all. If I go back, I'm going to have to decide between the brick oven pizzas, the ultimate nachos and the chipotle mac and cheese. Everything sounded really great, and the service was friendly, too.\n\nIf you don't want to sit on the patio, the dark interior features lots of sports televisions and a masculine atmosphere of wood furnishings. The place reminded me a little of D'Arcy McGee's, so if you're on the other end of Tempe Marketplace, you have another option for pub fare.",366,2
"I couldn't be more pleased with my experience with Dr. Mar and her staff.  Honestly, I'm blind as a bat.  The most memorable part of my testing is that I didn't have to have my eyes dilated.  Why?  Because this place has every piece of modern technology known to man.\n\nMy examination was like an assembly line, moving from one machine to the next.  Quick and efficient, which is really important to me.\n\nEric, Dr. Mar's assistant, was terrific.  Personable, warm and friendly (which is hard for some to do at 9:15am) and informative (not just someone operating a machine.)\n\nDr. Mar herself?  She's wonderful.  Soft spoken, obviously well-educated and she gave me some great options regarding my lens choices (which I didn't realize I had.)\n\nMy wife is bugging me to get a pair of glasses to wear instead of my lenses.  Because of my bad eyesight, the strength of my lenses make my eyes so small I look like a rat.  After telling this to Dr. Mar, she completely agreed and said any glasses I got couldn't take that effect away.\n\nIn my opinion, most doctors wouldn't even comment and if they did, they'd be trying to sell me a pair of glasses and downplay my concerns.  Dr. Mar gets extra points for honesty and putting the patient's needs first.\n\nThe fact that the store is in my neighborhood gets the fifth star.  I'm all about convenience.  When I do business with someone, I want to be treated like a person, not a number.  That's exactly my experience with Dr. Mar and her staff.  Great job!",383,4

"My vehicle broke down and was left at a shopping center late night. It was enough stress trying to figure how to get vehicle fixed..but along with that comes the worry of getting the vehicle towed to my auto shop by a trustworthy..and affordable towing company in the area. After researching companies on google and Yelp..I came across Quik Pik also known as All Over Towing.  They were the only placed I called and was very impressed with Meghan at their office, and Eric the driver. I was quoted 45 mintues and he was their in 20 minutes. Even called me when approaching the area where my car was located. It was quickly transported to Advanced Tire and Auto on 8th st and Greenway Pkwy whom the towing company and I do business. It was a relief to have such professional people to deal with in this business considering there are a lot of shady ones out there. Thanks again !",187,4

"I enjoy the quality of food. It is always consistant and they have friendly people taking your order. Beware of Sat and Sun afternoons. And lunch hours.

My fave is the sweet pork burrito. Always a winner.",85,3
When I came to this location only one girl was working window and front. I literally waited 10min to even get an order and while I was ordering she was trying to make a milkshake and get drinks for the drive thru. I felt bad for her I could tell she was stressed so I bit my tongue. But sadly they messed up my order too. I wanted the new 6 burger with the homemade bun but instead I got the regular bun. Which is the whole reason I went there was to try it. I then had to wait another 10 min for them to get me a new burger. \n\nTip to management: you are running your floor thin and understaffed. You may not have a lot of hours to use cause of a slow location. But experience of customers is key. Plus over working your employees! Get someone else in there to help with the windows so the people who do choose to come in and enjoy your service can actually enjoy it!!!,201,1

"Las Vegas is known for The Strip, several miles of massive resort casinos that will do just about anything to catch a visitor's attention.  City Center complex is no exception.\n\nThis ultra modern, sleek design mixed use area is home to the Mandarin Oriental hotel.  Upon entering the MO, guests travel up to the twenty-third floor to the Sky Lobby a refreshingly unique concept.  However the Tea Lounge is just sort of there by the check-in desk.  It has all the charm of a Starbucks kiosk in any lobby in any hotel in any major city in the country.\n\nOnce seated guests are treated to an amazing view of the city.  The couches are extremely comfortable for lounging, not necessarily ideal for eating.  The tea selections are seemingly endless with different herbal/floral combinations.  The food offerings are meager to put it nicely.  This is after all a high tea experience not a true meal.  One would be advised to skip the full tea spread and opt for scone which are, by far, the best thing on the menu.  The tea sandwiches began life as unimaginative snacks, then they dried out and lost any appeal or zest.  The dessert offerings seemed like a frozen sampler that might be put out in the lobby of a retirement community.  The scones were different, they arrived warm and buttery and were a delightful accompaniment to the many selections of teas on the table.   The mixologist at the MO is also quite creative and one should sample one or more of the unique drink selections on the menu.    \n\nThere is a feeling of refined class in the City Center complex and the Mandarin Oriental is no exception.  The fixtures and displays are beautiful.  The choices in furnishings and surfaces throughout reek of class and sophistication; however, the servers have soaked in a bit too much class.  During one tea service, there were at least four different servers that touched our table, and I cannot remember one giving our table a genuine smile.  I believe the meter has tipped over to the level of snooty.\n\nThis experience is one that would be nice for a couple or small group staying in the City Center, as a break from the typical Las Vegas itinerary.  However, it was not particularly memorable.  Unless you are a tea aficionado, and you take high tea daily, save your money and experience some of the truly special experiences Las Vegas has to offer",499,1

"LOVE LOVE LOVE Kristin! I discovered Kristin via a Groupon deal that she had for $35 for either a facial or a massage so I decided to give it a try. She is so amazing with her facials which are customized to your skin type and really leave you feeling all nice, clean and smooth and she takes so much time massaging all the products in your face for maximum results. I have really weird sensitive skin that does get congested if I don't get a facial every couple of months or so and with Kristin my skin looks amazing and fresh. The facial always include a neck and shoulder massage which she really does take her time on. I've also had a full massage with Kristin and I feel so light and relaxed after that. She has a great package on her website for a massage and a facial which does end up saving you a little money. I loved Kristin so much that I bought my mom a massage and facial package too and even she's hooked. Her appointments do go fast but usually scheduling a week or so ahead has never been a problem for me sometimes if you keep checking you might find an appointment for sooner too. I will never let anyone else touch my face ever again. Kristin has my business for as long as I live in this city.",260,4

Pad thai..well...what can I say, I've had better..but it was decent.  \n\nOverall, it was okay.  I would come eat here again if friends want but when i think of Thai food, I don't think of this place.  That says a lot unfortunately.  \n\nIf you are in the area, and you are in the mood for decent thai food, this would be it. Otherwise, I say skip it.",212,2

I simply ordered the boneless wings appetizer for dinner.\n\nAll of my friends food came out together and my wings came out about 8 minutes after everyone else's food. Due to me not being overly  hungry it was n big deal. There were about 15 or so little pieces of chicken in the basket and a small side of ranch.  I ate about 5 pieces with the ranch.  \n\nAbout 30 minutes later I started to sweat a little and did not feel so good. I then excused myself and went my my officer where I spent the next 3 hours in the toilet with diarrhea and the drive heaves.

"Long story short, I only like coming here to drink.\n\nShort story long, well, when people talk, drink and sit there for at least 2 hours, they get hungry, so they want to eat. I've been to this location several times, mostly to drink and once on Tuesday $1 burger night. Like I said, I prefer to come here only to drink but when I do eat, their food is what gives this place the 3-Star rating, it's OK.\n\nI've had other items that I've tried on the menu but they were so 'awesome' that my brain totally blocked it from my memory-- yes, sarcasm. $1 burger night, it's $1 for the bun, top and bottom and the patty. You're able to choose what you'd like on the burger, little did I know that they charge for all the rest of the stuff. I forgot how much they charge per item but I added onions, tomatoes & guacamole, it was beyond $1 at that point. Alright here it is, the burger was-- BLAH. I didn't care for it. The patty was dry, seemed like they cooked it and put it in the warmer for a LONG time. The bread fell apart, as if it were old, dry bread. I liked the fillers than I did the rest of the burger- the part that mattered!\n\nAt least I'll always have my beer, mmm, beer.",311,2

Getting happy over soup - it's just that gramazing.  \n\n**Note: When the staff inquire how hot you would like your meal, (even if you like your food spicy - as I do) reply: not spicy thanks. Rather than enhancing the flavor of the food, (if you order your meal \""Thai hot\"" - I think they have 5 levels and I had ordered \""4\"") it will make you sneeze/cough unceasingly. They pound the food with pepper and your body will violently rebel.",137,3
"Went there for the first time last night and was unimpressed with the service. Our waiter never came back to our table to check on us, see if we needed any refills on our drinks or ask if we would like dessert (assuming they have dessert.)

The restaurant wasn't busy enough to account for it either. Won't be back.",104,1

"The rooms are amazing at the vdara for the price, the trouble comes when dealing with guest services.  They are pretentious across the board and really unpleasant outside of trained politeness.\n\nCompulsory 18% gratuity on 200$ cabana rentals (not just the service/food/drinks but *everything*) is ridiculous and the staff act like they know it.  You're giving a ~40$ tip for the honor of paying 200$ for a few lawn chairs and a tent (and couple waters and and apple or two also).\n\nPros:  The rooms are amazing for the price and you are in the heart of everything south strip.\n\nCons:  The pool is crowded  on busy days and the staff is insufferable.  Just the initial dealing with cabana reservations was a very off-putting experience.\n\nAny billing issues seem to be handled by some call center the service is even worse there.

"I have been to Mad Mex several times with mixed results.  Unfortunately, yesterday was definitely the WORST. I ordered the nachos with taco meat.  It looked awful when it was served and tasted worst.  Still undeterred I ordered the shrimp taquitos.  Again, the presentation was horrible, the exterior soggy and oily, the interior looked like cat food and tasted like it (I'm sure).  We were sitting at the bar, 3 of us and our service was mediocre. When I told our young bartender that my food was really bad she said nothing and did nothing.  I will never eat there again!",130,0
"= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =\n\nStopped back in here today, this time joined by Mike C.  Again, this place is a hard one to rate as there are both good & not so good things about it.\n\nOk, let's get the negatives from this visit out of the way:\n\n*  Again there were empty spots in the serving line.  There should be SOMETHING in every available tray location, even if it's just some celery, hardboiled eggs or whatever.\n\n*  Our table steward didn't offer to bring us complimentary Dosas this time.\n\n*  There are foods that amount to soups, but the nearest thing they had available to function as bowls were little white styrofoam cups!  What's a restaurant with \""classy\"" atmosphere, as this one has, doing even having such containers in the building?\u00bf?\n\n*  One of the soups was only lukewarm.\n\n*  As before, the Buffet price is a little high at $10.95\n\n*  I like nice hot garlic flavored Naan, but all we were offered was blah, completely plain Naan, served at room temperature.\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = \n\nYes, there were also some positives:\n\n*  The decor here is classy, and this may be the nicest Indian Restaurant in the Valley.     :-)\n\n*  The selection of food was larger this time, about 30 items, which is generous for an Indian Buffet.\n\n*  The food is good overall & some dishes are unusual compared to what is served at most of the Indian Buffets in the Valley.\n\nAll in all, I feel that the negatives pull this one down to 3 Stars this time.  We have lots of choices for good Indian Buffet in the Valley.     :-)",428,2

"I had planned to have Thai this past Tuesday (10/28) when I met an acquaintance at work who told me he'd been inundated with phone calls all day from friends and relatives wishing him an Indian \""Happy New Year.\""  (10/29- time in India is 12 hours ahead.)  Since I had wanted Indian cuisine for some time, I decided I'd hold off on having Thai and go for Indian that night.  I first thought of going to Royal Taj on Broadway, but I wasn't looking forward to the slow service.  I've wanted to try Taj Mahal ever since a coworker told me how good the samosas were there, though she had admitted that she's never had samosas before.  I figured what better time to try a new Indian restaurant than on their New Year!\n\nI noticed one other couple besides me that night, and they were waiting for their entrees.  I greeted the host Jimmy, who turned out to be one of three siblings that ran the restaurant.  He was very welcoming, and we exchanged \""Happy Divalis\"" as he led me to my table.  I liked the subtle lighting in the main dining area, where most of the light came modern Indian music videos displayed on TV.  I thought the yellow curtain upon which a silver-studded likeness of the Taj Mahal served as a nice alternative to a regular door- this apparently led to the restrooms, which I wouldn't find out until the next day, when I took my Mom to have dinner there again.\n\nI decided on having an app for dinner- samosa with channa chat: a crisp vegetable patty consisting of potatoes and peas with channa masala, a dish made with chickpeas/garbanzo beans, onions, tomatoes, garlic, garam masala, cilantro, and spices (turmeric, cumin, peppers, and coriander, to name a few).  Waiting for my entree, I munched on a papadum with chutneys of mint and tamarind and chatted with the couple next to me, who expounded the details of the celebration of Divali, a winter harvest festival honoring the return of good Lord Ram from exile and his triumph over demon-king Ravan with fireworks, flowers, worship, and with sweets.  I chose to do my part in the celebration by having rasmalai and gulab jamun later on that night :D\n\nI found the samosa quite delightful with the channa masala (aka chana or chole, as in chole bhature), but it would be equally delicious without the garnish.  For dessert, I couldn't decide between the gulab jamun, a favorite, made with homemade cheese cubes fried and swimming in sugar syrup and the rasmalai, also made of homemade cheese, but not fried, and cooked instead with condensed milk and rosewater sugar syrup sprinkled with crushed pistachios, so I had both!  \n\nJimmy was very accomodating as I asked my usual questions regarding my food allergies, and he happily obliged me with the details of their lunch buffets- from 11a to 2:30p, $8, each day with differing 5 veggie entrees, 3 meat entrees, 2 breads (plus your choice of plain or garlic naan, which is served to you at the table), basmati rice, a dessert, and the usual accompaniment of 4 or 5 chutneys.  If menu options do not satisfy you, the kitchen staff will gladly oblige as long as your requests are of northern India origin- it is a Punjabi restaurant.\n\nI enjoyed my experience here so much, I returned again with Mom the next night.  Mom was open to going there, not knowing much of Indian cuisine, bec. I had brought home keema naan (stuffed with minced lamb) which she enjoyed.  Since she and I like lamb, I ordered the lamb rogam josh, a tomato-based dish, curry-like, with onions, garlic, chilis, and spices.  I had hoped to speak with Jimmy to get his lamb suggestions, but as it turned out, he was busy helping out in the kitchen.  (He actually cooked our dish and remembered speaking of making the lamb jalfraize too late into the preparation of the rogan josh dish.)  $13 price tag didn't include rice, which was disappointing, since Udupi Cafe and other restaurants I've visited in the valley do, so I ordered garlic naan.  \n\nAgain we were served papadum and chutneys while we waited for our food.  As usual, Mom thought everyone else's selections looked delicious as they were brought to their tables.  They certainly SOUNDED terrific- sizzling chicken tandoori and a salmon dish I cannot recall.  The dishes arrived, but Mom did not enjoy the samosa chana chat for she had found it too spicy (I thought it was perfect!).  It wasn't too late to alter the spice level of the lamb dish, which also did not appeal to her.  I found it to be good, if a little too gamey.  I only had a taste since the samosa app was very filling.  At least Mom enjoyed the wonderful garlic naan.\n\nI will definitely be back to try the lunch buffet.",1113,3

"This is a fantastic sushi restaurant.  I've never really been a big fan of sushi but Naked Fish has made me a convert.  When my fiance and I are in town, we have to have sushi and a good bottle of sake at Naked Fish.  \n\nMy fiance and I love it.  We've been there three times so far.  If we waited for seat, we didn't wait long and we always enjoyed ourselves.  The place is small, cozy and has an all around great atmosphere.  The wait staff is very warm, friendly and helpful.  Food is fresh, flavorful and always beautifully presented.  I have to recommend the house special, \""Happy Ending,\"" and \""Bonzai.\""",153,4

"I signed up for Yelp specifically to give this review.  If I could give zero stars, I would.\n\nI've had the opportunity to stay in many luxury hotels in the past, and although there's been a fair share of hotels that have not lived up to their name/hype, Trump definitely takes the cake as far as crappy service and hideous accomodations.\n\nI stayed there for 2 nights with three other girls to celebrate a bachelorette party.  My friend had booked 2 adjoining suites through www.hotels.com and since I was flying in 2 hours earlier, she called the hotel and put my name on the reservation.  Needless to say, when I got there, my name was nowhere to be found.  When a manager was called over, he said that my friend was suppose have called www.hotels.com instead.  What the hell?  Why shouldn't you be able to call the hotel directly?\n\nI sat in the lounge for 2 hours, waiting for my friends to arrive.  When they finally did and we went to check in together, guess what?  My name had miraculously appeared on the reservations.  Of course, the SAME GIRL who tried to check me in a couple hours prior was the same one we had to deal with - and she never bothered to tell me that my name finally appeared on the confirmed reservations even though she knew I was waiting in the lounge.\n\nOther front desk nightmares: there were no adjoining rooms left but when I started to complain (loudly), suddenly one opened up.  It took the girl 20 MINUTES to check us in.  No joke - I was timing it!  When we checked out, they messed up on BOTH our bills.  And charged us a RESORT FEE PLUS TAX for each room, each night we stayed.\n\nOn to the rooms.  Talk about run-down and disgusting.  Let me just list a FEW things that were broken: alarm clock didn't work, closet door wouldn't open, remote control was broken, mattress was too small for the bed frame so our comforter kept sliding down into the huge gap at our feet, and our padlock didn't even work!  The best thing is, we got one king-size bed instead of two beds in each room.  Umm, hello?!?!  There were four of us checking in!!!!\n\nThe \""best\"" part of the stay?  Complaining (in a VERY long email) to the general manager and having her offer us a \""good rate\"" at our next stay and refunding only our resort fees.  Please!  Like I would ever stay at your poor excuse for an establishment again.",565,0
"Imagine reclining in your own remote controlled chair, in a row and seat that you purchased ahead of time, while resting your popcorn or wine on your personal valet table at the movies. \n\n Now imagine a movie theater that takes the experience so seriously that if you are caught texting, playing on your phone or being loud, they won't warn you, they will kick you out.  That is how they roll - guaranteed courtesy at the movies. \n\nBecause of their strict courtesy rule, I am not sure if I would bring young kids to this theater.  But I know it is great for date night!\n\nMy best advice - buy your tickets ahead of time because the good seats sell out quickly and you want to make sure you can sit next to your friends or family.  That is my only complaint and reason for 4 stars.  We have come a few times and walked away to another theater because of the seating issue.  But as long as you know ahead of time, it's all good.",214,3

"Well, I hope the owners of the UPS Store at 7065 W Ann Rd will read this.  Yesterday my brother and I went to this store for notary.  There was a young man there and a woman.  The young man told us there is only a notary there until 330pm and referred us the adjacent bank inside the grocery store. Apparently, this is a common practice. On the way my brother told me the female in there is a notary because she has notarized for him before.  He also said his friend had gone in there before and she refused to notarize for him.  I cannot locate the owners of this store as they are a corporation.  I would not want an employee like this working for me.  Needless to say, I won't go back there again for any reason.",173,0
"So after we left The Town Square, we came here to the Outlet. We walked around checking out different stores and kiosks... Needless to say, we walked from one end of the Outlet to the other end just because we had nothing else to do for the day. We ended up buying two little monkeys that are magnetic for the frides (for my newphews).. The oldest one keeps asking for the monkeys that can wrap around you.. one that we saw at the stores in the airports,....I got him a mini version, but will get him the big one as well. We got them from the souvenir spot. Then we bought these slimy balls that when we you throw then down on the counter, they splat then return to their original shapes. $4.99 plus tax for each one.. But there was a special... if you bought two, the third one was free. We also bought tshirts that had gangsta Mario from Super Mario Bros on them for Lil Man and the two of them. They were $14.99 for each shirt plus a extra $1 to have \""Las Vegas\"" added. And of course I had Las Vegas added to all three shirts. The last thing that we bought was a model of a Chinook (Army plane). We chatted with the sales guy for quite some time. He was trying to convince my son and me why a little plane (not the Chinook)...one that could fit in your palm, was a bargain... Telling us that it normally runs $79.99 plus tax, yet he was willing to let us walk out of the outlet with a price of $40... YEAH RIGHT... Lil Man asked about the Chinook...And the guy gave his pitch about how it costs $139.99 plus tax, but was willing to give it to us at $80. Well well well, we walked out of the outlet with only paying $70 for it and called it a day so that we could go home and test out the new gadget that we bought. Both of us had fun last night playing with it. It is a remote controled Chinook. We had a fanatastic time hanging out and playing with it.",449,3
Of all the food experiences while staying at the palazzo this was the worst. Staff seemed to be rushing us and then we couldn't find them. Next thing we knew they were closing down and it was still early. Seems when the last game is over they shut it down. Tried again another night to go down for a drink and it was already closed as well. Food was mediocre and not something I'd rec. good place to watch a game (when they're on) and there is a sports book desk if you want to bet but I'd eat elsewhere and get here early.,122,1

Nice young guy from Russia or something but he had the arrogance to tell me his pizzas are the best, was expanding to LA and that if I did not like them I could take my business elsewhere.

"I dragged my boyfriend and friend to try this place. I went to the NYC location a few years ago and just wanted to see the Vegas location to see how it compares. Unfortunately, I love the NYC location WAY more. This one is much larger and the service is great, but I just didn't have the exact same feeling walking into this one in comparison with the NYC one.\n\nThe wait was significantly shorter though I must say. In NYC, we waited like 30-45 minutes for a table and the place is cramped. This location we waited only 10 minutes. But still, it just lacked a certain charm to it all.\n\nThe menu is very extensive and very large! Literally!\nBut the most famous thing to order is their Frozen Hot Chocolate. Luckily, my boyfriend and I shared. I was tempted to get my own but I just couldn't do it. It's HUGE! It was pretty yummy and not overly sweet.

"I really love this chain of hotels. We have a time share and have been able to take advantage of all the fabulous things that the Hilton has to offer. \nThe staff is attentive and courteous and were helpful with all of the questions about shows, theater seating, restaurants, etc. They were even able to help us out with some discounts to Cirque shows. Also, there is the wonderful little \""Welcome Package\"" that you can pick up when you check in. It's full of coupons and helpful info for local places (the Market place, Macy's). \nThere is a small grocery area/coffee shop/pizza place/deli on the first floor. It is open 24 hours, which is great when you get back late from being out on the town and just want a snack. \nThe fitness center is one of the better ones that I've seen at any hotel, with a good selection of machines and enough of them that you don't ever have to wait. \nThe guest lounge has some activities to enjoy when you are too tired to go out, but still want to do something fun. You can play foozball, ping pong or billiards.\nThere is a beautiful outdoor pool, with 2 or 3 hot tubs around it. It closes at 8, which is kind of a bummer. After walking all the way down the Strip to MGM, the idea of soaking in a hot tub was all I could think about! Ultra disappointed that it closed so early. Luckily, there was a Jacuzzi tub in the room!\nThe rooms/suites are set up like efficiencies or apartments. There is a small dining area, kitchen/ette and living room area. It's a great layout, especially if you have several people staying, as there is a enough room to spread out and get a little privacy from time to time.\n\nSome might complain about the lack of casino or the distance from the main part of the Strip, but this place is more like refuge from that hustle and bustle. It close enough to everything that you can have a great walk and be there in a decent amount of time, but far enough away that you can retreat from the drunken crowds and smoke. The Monorail is just across the street in the Sahara or there is a bus stop not  far down the street. They are both really easy to use and get you to almost anywhere on the strip in 10-15 minutes...or less!\n\nI would definitely come back again!",518,4

"Stayed here for a conference and was surprised on how nice the rooms where. We had two rooms right next to each other so were able to open the connecting door and it made the space so much larger.

To spare you of some of the details and make a very long story short I'll just say this:\n\nThis service was the worst I've ever seen. We had a reservation. We watched a table of 8 be seated after us, served their meal, and dessert before we got our food. My brother's Caesar salad had one crouton.

We also were able to get a pool view and I wish we had taken advantage of that pool more often because we only went once, but the pool felt awesome. If youre looking to get drunk in the water, but a dayclub is probably to much for you the next day then definitely check out the pool.\n\nMy friend also told me that they allow pets where they even have a floor where its like fake grass and you can walk your dog there and let them play etc. She also mentioned that they have a babysitter service as well, so great if youre just going to a show or something (better not be goin to a club if you got a baby waitin for ya!!! shame shame). Home to Marquee dayclub/nightclub so very convenient if youre planning to go there and oh yea!... Secret Pizza place located here as well! ;)\n\nBut I'm all for the interior design especially the bathroom and the cool lighting and wallpaper.

"Our first time tonight, and the reviews we read on Yelp did not disappoint. It was a very clean environment the temperature was nice and chill so you know the sushi was good. Me and my wife both like the fact that they had specialty cuts of fish such as konch shell fish, salmon belly, halibut fin, and even scallop raw. Our server was very helpful and guiding us through the menu and even helping us learn how to drink a sake bomb. We sat at the bar and cook was very helpful. Recommending cuts of fish that he thought we might enjoy. And even stearing us in the right direction for dessert. The price was only a few dollars more than where we used to go as regulars, but here we felt that we were treated nicer and also got fresher fish for our money. If you make a trek to this location, be sure to sit next to Pete at the bar. The guy knows his way around the sushi bar and is very entertaining with his blow torch when he is searing items. Definitely worth the extra dollars if you're going to spend the money on sushi anyways.",227,4
"Waited an hour to get my car cleaned. They did a poor job of it, and I will never come back to this place again. Their employees look like they just got out of jail, and were cussing in front of customers.",51,0

"This is a fun place to dine out if you enjoy country music, drinking out of mason jars and Applebees-style food. OK, so I only enjoy the first two, and while we had a good time here, it was just an average sort of experience.\n\nI went with two of my friends who dig these types of places and we were stunned at the enormity of the place. Of course we stopped to pause at the KNIX/Buck Owens memorabilia, while we killed an hour with our Applebees-style buzzer -- and then checked out Bass Pro Shop next door.\n\nNo one was really wowed by the food. In fact my chile chicken sandwich was incredibly hot -- so much so that I had to scrape the Hatch chile seeds from off the chicken breast -- ONLY recommended if you like it REALLY spicy. The Toby's Platter was average.. if only memorable for the odd mac/cheese wedges, that were a bit too dry.\n\nService was ok, but our server did bring out the entrees before our appetizer... not sure how/why that happened. But they quickly took the entrees away and brought our Toby's Platter appetizer to us quickly. I hope we got new entrees!!! One thing I did like -- they didn't bat an eye when we ordered celebratory shots... and why would they? This is a hard partying Toby Keith roadhouse!!!",289,2
"Was there for breakfast, the food wasnt that good actually so I was a bit dissapointed, had very high hopes for this place.\nThe decor is super 80's and fun. The prices are on the + side but so are the portions.\nMaybe next time I visit I will only go to the lounge area, skip the rest.",73,2
Grilled SQUID Is good!!  Beginning of chinatown approximately a mile from the steip.\n\nPrice is cheap when compared to food on the strip. Everything we ordered is good. My daughter loved the satay beef with peanut sauce. Crab fried rice is awesome.,57,3
"Cirque Du Soleil but only edgy and more soft core porn. It's a big orgy fest! \n\nThe show was fantastic. The high light of the show was the two chicks that were swimming in the water. They always say you shouldn't dive into shallow pools but they did that. \n\nSome of the acts seem like the same thing I've seen before, to the hula dancer to the girl flying across the crowd in bed sheets. But than again they are naked, well boobies and all. \n\nThe singers were great as the band. I'm not sure how the band can stay on a bridge above the stage and not drop anything. But hey whatever.\n\nThe funny parts of the show were the \""clowns\"". The Scotch Boobies was a funny skit as well as the interaction with the audiences. The big girls, they were funny as well when they interacted with the audience. Dildos were used. \n\nI wasn't big on the seats. Should have spent the extra money to get to the bottom.\n\n**Guys if you go with your girl friend make sure you cover your GF's eyes when the muscle guy comes out and starts ripping of his clothes. **",264,4
"The food and drinks were amazing last night. The service however, ruined it. We showed up a little after 6 and was strongly advised by our waiter to get drinks and apps because they were bogo during happy hour. We ordered drinks and apps and an entree each. The drink I ordered was Shandi something and it was spicy, peppery and perfect. My friend had 'The Maria' . It was fruity and on the sweet side but equally as delicious. The appetizers we got were plated beautifully. The scallops were my favorite, nice and crispy outside yet tender and mild on the inside. The stuffed portobella mushroom was tasty too, I just would have liked it served warmer since it was deep fried. I had the lamb shank after being advised by the waiter it was much better than the lamb stir fry i ordered at first. The lamb shank was every bit of amazing as it was expected to be. The sauce was extremely spicy, flavorful as well as hot. I coughed after my first bite. The lamb itself was so tender it fell off the bone. I could cut the meat with my fork. My friend had the baby eggplant dish and loved it. Now I bring myself to the downer of this meal....the LACK of SERVICE! We were never offered refills on our drinks, yet our glasses of water were refilled continually by the busboy. Once we were finished with our meal we sat and waited for our check for over 30 minutes with our waiter nowhere in sight. Thank God my friend was so entertaining or else I would have been more upset. After 40 minutes had gone by I started flagging down anyone i could find to ask for our check. I asked the bartender, the hostess, the busboy...then finally our waiter appears and presents us with our check. The check was wrong of course because he had charged us full price for the drinks and apps he worked so hard to sell us on for happy hour. I could understand though since it was now 8:15. I quickly jumped up and followed him back to the kitchen and asked him if he could fix our check. His response was \""I will speak with the manager about it\"" to which I responded \""We are in a hurry!\"" Then he said \""Okay I'll take it off right now.\"" Hahaha I think I scared myself a little there, but whatever it worked! We finally got out of there. It was really busy for a Tuesday night, but nonetheless that is no excuse for poor service. \n\nFood = 5 stars \nService = 0 stars",527,1
"Thinking about Matthew Broderick perhaps?  Erase that thought; this bar didn't really remind me of my college experience at all either.  There were too many meatheads, pompous jocks that I don't miss leaving behind in my old high school days.  Don't get your undies in a wad, I have plenty of friends that play sports and I like competitive sports as much as the next guy, but a lot of these regulars are stereotypical steroid freaks.  \n\nI am getting myself in trouble here, it very well could have been some kind of football after game outing.  I managed to meet an older brother that was into the Pistons, this was the highlight of the evening.  Either way, I am not taking the chance again with this place.",162,1
I stopped by this place so I could give a small local owned business a chance to earn my business and at 11:30 AM on Friday morning they were not serving sandwiches because their manager wasn't there. ??  I went across the street to Wendy's and they were happy to fix me lunch and take my cash. \n\nThe location is terrible and I actually had to make an effort to find them in the strip mall that they are located in. You would think that they could at least be ready to serve lunch at lunchtime.,115,0

It seems like one of the pools is always closed - so annoying... And the pool furniture needs to be up graded - it's so old and worn... \n\nSA needs to do a makeover!

"If eating a pizza cookie is wrong, I don't want to be right.\n\nOregano's in Scottsdale is a fantastic, fun place to get some Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere, maybe while catching a ballgame on the TV.\n\nThere's a pizza pie for everyone regardless of your preference - deep dish, thin crust, original, you name it. Do yourself a favor and get the guacamole. Holy Moly! I could have survived on that alone.\n\nThe wait stuff are young and fun, and I even did something I never do at a restaurant - I bought a T-shirt. A baseball jersey-style Oregano's shirt that remains one of my favorite tees.\n\nSidle up to the bar if that's your thing, you'll get great service, conversation, and of course, food. or bring a date and enjoy pizza, lasagna, spaghetti, you name it.\n\nParking is sparse and the wait may be a little long (get there early for lunch) but it's well worth it.\n\nI just wish there was an Oregano's near me in Michigan.",243,3
"This is one of those places that when you see it for the first time, second time or eighth time that you will not stop and eat. \nIt is located on Craig road near the I15 and right next to the Pilot truck stop on your way north. I made that mistake for to long and then finally convinced my self to try it. It has a small parking lot and even  walking to the door you are still not sure ... but when you enter - Oh Yes.\nThe decor is rustic with historical items placed around the large dining room and bar. The booths are great and the staff is very friendly. A great atmosphere with live music on most every night. ( keyboards or guitar) \nThe traditional mexican food is super, the guacamole is out of sight and the sea food dishes are excellent. It is totally inexpensive and you will leave \""Stuffed to the Max  - and happy that you are.\"" \nIt is well out of the way for most people, but if you have that need to visit the Cannery Casino, it is right on the way and should not be missed. \nJust don't let the location throw you off from the enjoyment of a supurb mexican dining experience.",250,3
"Let me start by writing I love their breakfast burritos.   My wife and I went inside and ordered two.   We waited, and waited, and waiting.....    watching cars come and go through the drive through.  After twenty plus minutes, I went to the counter to inquire about my order - it was not ready.   I asked the clerk if drive through customers  get served first?  She did not respond, but the crowd of people inside waiting for their food were all nodding.  I asked for my money back which they promptly provided.   No apologies however, and the cook in the back was glaring at me which made me uncomfortable.   I will probably be back - through the drive..   They need to improve their customer service and processes.    We ended going to McDonalds and  we received our food promptly.",169,1

Were double charged by the bartended on your credit card?  Have a complaint? Have a compliment?

Not very good.\nThey use cheap ingredients and lots of salt. Ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with beef and they must have just thrown in some cold roast beef slices. The beef was so tough and dry.

"I called 2 hours in advance of arriving to verify our reservation, which was made through a 3rd party site. After repeated calls to different numbers listed on their site, someone finally answered and I was told everything was fine and assured the room type I requested. When we arrived they insisted I never called, and when I showed them my call log they continued to insist this despite it showing a 5 minute call to their hotel. After 6 hours they didn't have our reservation and refused to call to check it. They insisted we pay again but assured they would \""fix it all\"" in the morning once they received their reservation. When we got to the room it was two \""double\"" beds, not the king as I was told. The entire hotel floor was covered in garbage, discarded food trays,  and debris. The room floor was also full of trash and dirt. There were public hairs all over the tiny, squalid room, which smelled heavily of sweat and smoke. I couldn't stop sneezing all night. The towels did not look clean and one was even damp and crumpled. The room walls are paper thin and you hear every person in the hall and in the nearby rooms. It was a horrible experience. When I spoke to the supervisor he only made flimsy excuses and platitudes. What a disgusting place. They don't even meet the minimum standards of cleaning or customer services that you would expect from a one-star hotel. Honestly, once you add in the resort fee ($13) and the taxi (about $25 each way, because its ridiculously far from the decent casinos and in a crappy, somewhat unsafe area), you may as well stay at a better place regardless of if you you got a good rate from a third party site.",361,0
"We shop this Walmart on a regular basis. Not sure why. Maybe because they have everything \""just in case.\"" The only way I can calmly shop here is to use the self check out. If they didn't have them, I probably wouldn't go there. All the employees seem impatient except the people in Paint and the ones running self check-out help. I would rather not bother the cashiers who are already upset. It's not too crowded of a Walmart like you usually see and is pretty easy to navigate beside the moms who are determined to run you over with the cart. The prices are actually quite more (and lesser quality food wise) than at Frys where we are going more often. \n\nThe pharmacy is just something to almost steer clear of. Lies after lies after lies, rude workers and only a couple that nicely answer your questions and are helpful. If you need medications next day, or in a couple, DO NOT GO HERE! We switched pharmacys after them being our main one and couldn't be happier!\n\nOh, and if you are going to eat the deli onion rings make sure you have super anti-acids!!",241,2
"First, let me start off by saying that I used to have a love affair with Roka.  The Omakase was the multi-course sumptuous dining experience I selected every time I visited.  They had a $99 option and a $128 one and both were an exotic extravaganza of delectable delights (the $128 Omakase promised extra exotic, pricier ingredients).\n\nThe Omakase is an improvisational dining experience with consideration given to the diner's food preferences and allergies.  When I used to order the Omakase, I always left dazzled by the presentation, colors, textures, and flavors of the dishes I received.  Every dish was superb and left you anticipating your next experience.\n\nSadly, the Omakase is now a shadow of its former self, sorely lacking across every culinary dimension and I have twice walked away feeling disappointed and ripped off.  In the past year, they have eliminated the $99 option, but kept the $128 one.  No matter, as long as the dishes maintain the same quality and consistency.  When I order the Omakase, I expect to receive exciting and surprising dishes that highlight the chef's creativity and artistry.   What I don't expect to receive are generic dishes that can be ordered off the menu a la carte for a fraction of the hefty $128 price tag.\n\nHere are the 6 courses I received at my last $128 experience (with accompanying a la carte prices): Shishito Peppers with Ponzu and Bonito - $7, a SINGLE scallop with curry sauce (since ONE scallop is not an a la carte menu item, I am going to be be generous and use the pricing for the Robata Grilled Scallops with Yuzu Shiso) - $15, Assorted Steamed Shellfish with Tomato Miso - $23, Wagyu Beef Tataki - $18, Crispy Brussels Sprouts  - $7, and a lackluster presentation of dessert which consisted of one scoop of ice cream - $4 and Cassis, Pear, & Blood Orange Mousse - $12 ( the dessert was also accompanied by a razor thin slice of pear, one slice of mango, and two slices of kiwi).  Had each of items been ordered a la carte, the sum total would have been $86, a $42 savings on the $128 Omakase price tag.  \n\nAgain, not only were the dishes not in keeping with the grand billing that Roka gives the Omakase: \""Roka Akor's Tour De Force, Featuring Our Signature Dishes and Inspired Creations\"" (not really sure where the 'inspired creations' part comes in since they are all a la carte dishes), the presentations have gone downhill too.  Desserts used to be magnificently presented on multi-platform dishes with tons of decorative fruits, flowers, and greenery.  Now they come on simple, small white plates.  This 'Tour de Force' is now nothing but a Tour de Flop and a colossal rip-off. As such, I can no longer recommend this place, nor will I be returning.  The love affair is definitely over.",669,1
I have spent hundreds of dollars at costco when my mom and I go. She always shows her card and we have never had a problem with the Costco on 44th street and Thomas. I went to pick up a graduation present at the costco near Paradise Valley Mall and was spending another 130.00. At time of purchase we were asked for the membership card which was shown and I went to pay for the item and we were refused tender. I was told that I could not purchase the item my mother had to... OR I could go get cash and hand it to my mom who in turn could hand it to the employee. Really funny because it's the same dang thing. I will no longer be a spending a dime in a store who sells to people on welfare which is covered from my hard work and taken out of my taxes when they refuse refuse service to the person who's entire family are members. Bye bye costco... I may only be one fish in the sea of your members but guaranteed if I experienced this poor service someone else will as well.,223,1
"I went to this school and after 6 years I had to get out.  Yes, it was academically challenging.  Yes, it prepares you for college.  Yes, the students apply themselves. But on top of all that, the students almost never smile.  The students are constantly miserable and never once say that they love the school.  It wasn't until I left the school that I realized what a toxic environment it was.  The lower school students only have 8 minutes to eat and aren't allowed to talk during lunch.  They have a strict dress code and no phone policy and as before I left, the headmaster of the upper school told me that I would never get as good of an experience and education as I would elsewhere and on top of all this, I wouldn't get into a good college or succeed like I would if I went to The Meadows School.

Unsanitary!  I wish I would have read the previous reviews (cockroach etc) as that would have saved us from one of the worst food experiences I've had in a long long time.  We ordered a chicken panini (in which they got it wrong and used ham) a soup which was so salty that it was inedible and finally a salad which came complete with a long blonde hair of one of the workers (we both have black hair). After showing the hair the only response I got was a refund of just the salad.  Please avoid this as there are much better options in Desert Ridge.  Even paradise bakery is a much better option.,136,0

"They don't have a sign on top so look for signage in the window. The place is in the LA Fitness plaza. Tables were full throughout my lunchtime visit on a Sunday. Pretty solid food. We ordered the following:\n\nTendons in chili oil: Great texture and spicy chills. A little bit too oily, but it hit my tendon craving. FYI, tendon may look like, but  is NOT, fat. \nStinky tofu: definitely not for the non-adventurous palate/nose. Smells kind of like you're at a farm...Nonetheless, I still ate my half of the dish without problems.\nXiao long bao (XLB, soup dumplings): A little too dry for my taste. Ask for a soup spoon to eat the traditional way with some vinegar and/or soy sauce. They should serve this with sliced ginger. \n3 cup chicken: Hearty, satisfying dish. Lots of chicken cooked down in a wonderful sauce reminiscent of home-cooked family meals. Only downside was the very bony chicken. \n\nWe didn't order any noodle dishes but they looked quite tasty at neighboring tables. Prices looked reasonable on the menu but came out to just under $20/person with tax and tip. Maybe we were just hungry and ordered a lot? I will be back, maybe on a weekday lunch where they offer 4 dishes for the price of 3 (cheapest item comped).",297,3

"Walmart... When I think of places that make me happy, Walmart does not make the list.

Impressive for noon on a Saturday.\n\nKudos to you Cave Creek Walmart. You should teach other Walmart's how to not suck.",195,3

"Petite little gifts, cute items for loved ones, sweet smelling novelties: Not my thing at all.\n\nNonetheless, the glaring blue exterior and golden sign were enough to entice me inside.  Indeed, Flux is full of the said items but nonetheless its delivered in a quaint manner and may just provide that perfect  hand made ornament or hand crafted art piece for your mum, after all mums love stuff like that....right??\n\nI'm positive plenty of people will love the unique items in this quirky gem, just not me.",113,2

"I really wanted to fall madly in love with this place, I mean, a British themed pub in Heritage Square? So promising. \n\nAs you walk in, the bartender is standing behind in an elaborate wooden bar structure. This made me think publican instead of bartender (as in \""Mate, I'll take a pint and d'ya have any rooms available?\""), which is probably the idea. As there was nice selection of draught beers, we walked around to the bar to the right and ordered a couple of pints. I ordered a Boddingtons, my friend ordered a Stateside micro brew. (Would have been nice if they had Old Peculiar on tap, but you can't have everything.) \n\nDue to the combination of things cooking in the kitchen, it smelled a bit like my grandma's house. This prompted us to make a beeline for the patio decorated with super-heavy wood furniture. I assume this is to discourage thieves from selling their tables and chairs on the black market. Smart. The piped-in music selection that night was a bit off-putting, in fact, one of the other patrons commented on it as well. It appeared to be a satellite radio station that specialized in 80s hits like Wham! and Depeche Mode. I guess George Michael and David Gahan ARE British. Indeed! Wikipedia just informed me that \""Dave Gahan (born May 9, 1962 in Epping, Essex, England) is the baritone lead singer for the English electronic band Depeche Mode, and is also an accomplished solo artist.\"" Now I feel better. \n\nThere are many cozy nooks in this place, so that would be a good thing if you wanted to have some one-on-one time. They were also playing football (soccer) on the flat screens, so should make some team scarf-wearing Brit ex-pats in the Valley very happy.\n\nWill I be back to try the food? Probably at some point. But, for another round of drinks, I think I'll wait for a Friday or Saturday night when it's hopping.",444,2

"WORST. PHO. EVER.  why this place has a 4-star rating totally irks me.  \n\npho is our [me, booboo, stan, ed, and benson`s] go-to hangover remedy after a night of hard partying in Vegas.  initially we were trying for Hash House A Go Go, but there was an 1.5 hour wait, so we decided to go elsewhere.  i hopped on my trusty Yelp app and searched for a restaurant close by.  Pho 87 popped up, and with a 4-star rating we figured, why not?  Yelp, for once you have failed me.\n\ni ordered the medium pho bo, with the rare steak on the side.  the noodles were tough and plasticky, an indication of cheap quality noodles.  the broth was bland and oily.  i had to resort to pouring fish sauce in it; i NEVER pour anything in my soup.  even that couldn`t salvage it.  after about 6 bites, i stopped eating.  .\n\n \nwe all ordered the pho bo, with the exception of ed, who ordered the pho dac biet [combination pho].  booboo had also ordered his pho bo the same way i did, with the rare steak on the side.  the woman we ordered from screwed up and forgot.  the guy ended up bringing his pho out with the steak inside.  we were all starving, but not one of us were even remotely close finished our food; that was how bad it was. \n\nomg that woman who took our order was so ANNOYiNG!  she was trying to be funny, but her jokes were falling flat.  we were not amused.  the restaurant was barely a quarter full, but she was nowhere to be found when we needed something [water refill, lemons, the CHECK].  besides screwing up booboo`s order, she also kept trying to tell us how to eat things like the cha gio [\""wrap it in lettuce and dip it in the sauce\""] and the salted lemon soda [\""smash and mix well\""].  excuse me, woman, but i`m from San Francisco, which is 3O minutes away from San Jose, where some of the best pho places can be found.

"My family and I have visited the Eastern location a few times.  It's kind of pricy, about $60 for two kids meals and two, pick two combos.  Not even any crab... The cod and shrimp.  The food is usually good though, so every once in a while, we'd go for dinner.\n\nWe were SO excited to have the rainbow location open, as it's much closer to our house.  We went tonight for dinner to check it out, and were disappointed.  Our same meals that were $60 are now $70, and aren't even close to being as good.  It's just too expensive for what you get.\n\nThe restaurant was loud, and the service was meh... Not great, but not horrendous.  Our food came out in a decent amount of time, and the kids meals were okay.  Our pick two meals were not great though.  The cod was a joke... The pieces were so small that it was more like getting two fish sticks.  It was also very overlooked, dry and tough. The potato salad is still phenomenal, but it didn't make up for the rest of the meal.  My parents got the muscles, which they usually love and were told are currently in season.  My mom thought they were okay, but my dad thought they were so bad that he refused to eat them.\n\nWe won't be going back any time soon, which is a shame, as it's about 5 minutes away from our house.  I'm still in shock that two combo meals and two kids meals were $70, for the quality of food we received.",354,1

Ughh sorry sweetheart your 18 and I'm pretty sure you don't even know how to parallel park. \n\nok sorry off to the review... :)\n\nThis place is the mother of all malls as far as shopping goes.

The collection of his belongings is pretty dang impressive and the employees that work there are pretty passionate.

"Quick Review: This place is terrible, don't ever go here. \n\nLonger: Went here to Saturday afternoon (2:30pm) to get an extremely dirty car detailed. $100 detail but the guy says \""hour and a half and it will look like it never had dirt on it\"".  We were a bit skeptical but sure man, your the pro! 3 and half hours later the place is closing and they tell us that we will have to bring it back tomorrow since they couldn't finish it. But they promise they just have a 1/2 hour left.  No one there to really  complain to since management had all left and we weren't gonna yell at the poor guys out in the heat who get paid terrible. \nNext day visit lasted another 5 hours! The car still wasn't really that clean when taken off the property! \n\nDon't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here. Don't ever go here.

"Key: Notice the dates on the reviews. This place was great but mismanaged into not so great. First thing to understand is that this is a fantastic location. The result is that they don't have to do it right to keep people coming in.\n\nI went inside the restaurant to eat last Saturday at 5:45 pm. Immediately noticed the place was a dump. Trash everywhere. Even a seat cushion was ripped. (When was the last time you viewed a ripped seat cushion in a McDonald's?) I used the restroom - same thing - one hand dryer was busted. Gross. \n\nBut I thought, maybe they cater to the drive through and neglect the store? So I went ahead and ordered my food anyways (plus I had a coupon). Both my Big Mac and the 1/4 pounder came with stale buns. How is this possible at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night?\n\nIt's all the fault of the management - the sad part is that it used to be fine but now it's not. Also there is a Chick-a-filet a mile up the road that is awesome. Maybe that is where the management goes to eat?",252,1

Thank God this place went out of business! I went in there one day and chatted up the owner a bit before ordering. It was about 3 in the afternoon and no other customers were around.

"Really liked my room and everything. The staff was very nice.\n\nI didn't like the sheer curtains. They need to be denser so the sun doesn't come through as strongly.

"I have passed The Spot many times and figured I would give it a try.  I arrived at 8:45 on a Saturday and to my surprise, not a car in the parking lot.  The hours posted on the door said they opened at 8, but the \""Open\"" sign was not on.  One quick phone call and they confirmed they were in fact open.  We walked in and the girl behind the counter was having a hard time with the computer.  She said \""I just keep hitting the wrong buttons.\""  Meanwhile, there are more people coming in and now the phone is ringing.  Another female employee answers phone, standing right next to the register, so nobody can hear what another is saying. The \""phone girl\"" is taking orders, but has not written anything down and is going by memory.  In fact the second phone order she takes, she laughs that \""It's a to go order so if its wrong they won't know until they are gone\"".  (A pad of paper would probably help you write down an order to ensure accuracy.)  \n\nAfter finally getting our order paid for we chose to sit at one of the long tables on the first level.  This is  mistake since there is only a small walk way to serve as a line, as well as people bringing out orders and others getting their drinks.  My chair was continually bumped as people moved around. I also felt bad as our party of 2 was now taking up a table for 8.  At least we chose an end so others could have joined us if they didnt mind being part of the line/counter order area.\n\nFood was good, but not great.  I felt it was quite expensive for the amount served.  Toast was dry and no butter or jam was anywhere to be seen.  Went to order another orange juice and stood in line so long that my food then was cold when I got back to it.  (Really pricey for a small bottle of juice $2.85?)   The air conditioner was on full blast so we sat shivering through the meal.  Many people went to sit outside after ordering.  \n\nA young man came in and was talking to the other employees that were working.  He must have been an employee as he was talking about the new Yelp reviews.  They kept talking about how they \""keep getting removed\"".  This was a reminder to me, that they do review their  reviews... Very important since it could help them.\n\nI could see the seating becoming a problem.  Not sure if there is another way to get more seating in there or not though.",553,2
Food was ok.  We had a group of 5 and the orders were as follows: \n\n2 orders of fish tacos\n1 tortilla soup and house salad\nTaco salad\nShrimp fajitas\n\nGreat portions and reasonable prices for them.  Service was slow though.,64,2

"Worst experience we ever had at a restaurant.  Halfway through our meal, the manager turned up the volume on the TV so loud that everyone in the place jumped.  When asked to have it turned down, he said \""I'm busy, I'll get to it when I can.\""  There was one table in the restaurant and about 8 people at the bar (buddies).  It was blasting and we asked again and finally it was slightly turned down and he told the staff, that's as low as I'm going to turn it.  You could not hear the person next to you talk.  \nIn addition, the tenderloin on forccaia, was nothing more than a wrap, that is not forcaccia bread, onion rings were terrible, fish was not cooked through.  Rude, obnoxious manager, will never go back and will tell everyone we know how we were treated.  And when we left, there still were no other tables in the place.",206,0
"This place is one of the worst sushi joints in town. Why is everything covered in their stupid sauce (which is just watered down siracha, by the way)? \n\nThe quality of fish is horrendous. The tuna was old/dull looking, the salmon seemed rotten. I got a little happy when i saw they had yellow tail only to be served a weird colored, trash smelling piece of sashimi. What a let down. \n\nI hate being so negative, but I really get mad with bad sushi and this place was bad.",115,0
"I made my first trip out to Sababa this afternoon and wanted to preempt my official FoodBurgh post with a quick review here. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the former Mr Willies space has re-appeared as a fantastic new family owned Middle Eastern restaurant.\n\nThe space is large, so there's plenty of room for good table spacing. The tables (covered by white tablecloths and white paper) each hold a single potted herb as a centerpiece (_amazing_ idea). The menu is split into a few sections: appetizers (which seem to be primarily vegetarian) and vegetarian options on the first column and grilled meat on the second. The chef tells me that all of their meat is Kosher (though I don't know about everything else).\n\nI ordered a Sababa Salad and found it to be just the right type of cool dish on a hot day. Avacado, hearts of palm, sliced tomato, and navy beans all sat atop a bed of mixed baby greens. A citrus-based dressing and sprinkles of flaked sea salt topped it all of.\n\nThe salad's flavors came together exceptionally well to create a brightly flavored but completely balanced salad--and one I didn't even have to feel guilty about eating. Very good.\n\nIf you're at all interested in Middle Eastern food (and I hear they have amazing Falafel), then this place is definitely worth a try.",295,3

"On a whim, my friends and I bought a Groupon for here for 4 people, and we went to celebrate my birthday.  We got there in time for happy hour and enjoyed some great drink specials and shared the chef's plate (really delicious!)  \nOur service was fantastic!  It was quite warm in the restaurant, but in all fairness it was 113 outside, and the restaurant has all windows with western exposure.  A manager quickly found a fan and pointed it in our direction, which helped immensely.  The selection of craft cocktails is fabulous, I tried the Lavender Lemon Fizz... wow, so good!  For dinner, I enjoyed the pistachio crusted salmon with orzo.  Again, it was delicious.   Everything was really great!  I can't wait to go back and make this our go-to spot to meet up with the girls!  My only tiny complaint is that the booths are really crammed in the space and not the most comfortable place to sit, especially when it's warm.  I think next time we go back, we'll request a table for sure!",233,4

"Unresponsive manager and people using their fingers to get food from the buffet! Yuck. Save the $19/pp and go somewhere else. \n\nAte here on a Saturday morning and ordered the breakfast buffet. Hot plates to put cold fruit on, if you can find a plate at all. Frozen cream cheese next to the strawberries (thinking it's whipped cream).....was so stuck to the serving spoon, that people were using their fingers to get it off on to their plates.  Bacon did not have tongs, and people were using their fingers instead. Tasteless food and chef burning cooked to order eggs was a turn off.\n\nMy husband was so dissatisfied with the buffet, that he ordered eggs Benedict off the menu. That was actually better. Hash browns tasted like they came out of a box, but the eggs were fresh and hot and the hollandaise sauce was very good.\n\nWhen we spoke to the manager, he was hearing me, but not really listening. Did not offer any remedy. All he could tell me was that he would look into quality control.

Mother-In Law's food was also cold and one order of \""toast\"" came out as bread- not toasted at all. There was no point in sending it back because no one ever checked back.

"I stopped into this place on a Monday night with a co-worker during one of my business trips.  I found it to be a mixed bag, for me.\n\nKeep in mind that I am not a sports bar person, so this review can be a little skewed.\n\nThe +'s:\n\nThe food portions were generous, and the items were generally tasty. Pricing is reasonable, and service was good.\n\nThe -'s:\n\nThe place is not well lit (maybe a just my impression as lighting has a very real effect on TV viewing) and since it is a gaming/over 21 establishment, it was a little too smoky for my liking (something I should have known in advance-so my bad). They do not accept American Express, so it did not work well for me or my business partner in that regard.\n\nOverall, tasty food, attentive, friendly service.  Just not \""my cup of tea\"" as they say.",208,2

At first, after several of his team members looked it over they couldn't find anything wrong with it. \n\nAfter looking up the date codes on my tires Chris discovered that the tires were nearly 7 years old! He recommended new tires and shocks. I had them install 4 new Toyo AT/2 tires and 4 new Bilstein shocks. I can honestly say I have never felt that truck ride so smooth!  What an improvement, and most importantly the vibration was gone.\n\nI really appreciated the time Chris and the other team members took to look over my truck and make the correct suggestion to resolve my issue.

"Amazing! \n\nThis place always hits the spot when I am craving something light and fresh. The owners are the cutest couple and have begun to recognize my order every time I call in. Which is rare for a restaurant, and why it is so awesome! \nTheir food is always on point. I typically order the Crispy Rice with Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Pork Belly, and a Kalbi Bowl. Yes I finish it all and Yes it's the same order everytime! When I do dine in I always love trying their newer menu items, but when it comes down to placing a to go order, it's always the same because they never go wrong. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is absolutely adorable. It is a small space but they make the best of it. My favorite is the cash-out section. All the toys and lego's make it so unique. There is even a mini sushi restaurant doll house on the counter that SHE made! Such talent. Def. a must see while you are in there. \n\nWell this review made me want to eat there again! Unfortunately they changed their days again to only open Thurs. - Sunday. Which is kind of a bummer, but it does make me wait and crave it even more! Which makes eating there even more of a treat!",274,4

This pharmacy is full of the most incompetent people I have ever had to talk to. I now go to the safeway across the street and have no more problems.

"This joint is famous for one dish above all. And rightfully so...the oxtail soup. It is fucking delicious! The soup has that rich flavor letting you know that its been simmering for hours and hours. The broth is rich, without as much grease or fat as you'd expect. Its well seasoned, and the herbs in it just add those nice little accents as you slurp it down. The meat on the bone is delicious. My fiance cleaned all of her bones bare. \n\nThe rest of the food isn't quite as special, but isn't bad. The price is reasonable, the service is okay, its open late, and you have more of a chance of winning at the casino outside than on the strip so that's a bonus.\n\nBut seriously...oxtail soup. Bam!",172,3
"Rooms are nice.  The beds are OUTSTANDING--I was so in love with the bed in our room.  The fact that hotel guests are given admission to their \""exclusive\"" venues (like Ghostbar) is a big plus--skipping the lines make you feel fancy, and frankly I just don't do lines so I get to experience things I wouldn't normally.\n\nThe casino floor has plenty of attractions, but the current construction is happening *inside*.  They're cutting wood with buzzsaws literally ON the casino floor, a stone's throw from the blackjack tables.  You can't even carry on a conversation when the saws kick in.  \n\nThis is what did it for me though: the hotel charges a \""resort fee\"" of $22.40!  For my $48 room, that's a 46% markup!  BEWARE!!

"I actually liked this dinky looking place. The big pink tent above sure catches your eye quickly if you're looking for this place.\n\nBoyfriend & I entered in a little before 9, check in time is 11 so we had almost 2 hours to kill before entering in. ACTUALLY check in time is at 2, you can check in at 11am but you have to pay $10 extra, not bad just to get to our bed earlier and rest a bit more. We walked around the waiting area, we came here for EDC and there were A TON of people here for the same thing, it was nice to see some fellow ravers before EDC even started :)\n\nI liked how there were convenient $10 and under thrift stores to buy presents, a small tiny store that sold Hello Kitty items and a LED clothing shop which is PERFECT for EDC outfit & accessories. There's also a Auntie Anne's & Krispy Kreme right next to each other, yummmyy! There's also this cute pizza spot called Pizzeria , I ordered a delicious Pesto Pizzazz Pizza :]\n\nThe hotel room was alright. We got the smoking room, it smelled like stogs in our room but the sucky part about this room was that we didn't even smoke in our room - _ - Since we were spending our time mostly at EDC, we just came back to our hotel; slept, watch a bit of tv, took showers, got ready and other things. \n\nAlso another downer on this place was that it's filled with kids because of course of all the games and what not in this place :((",350,2
"First of all let me say that the service has been awesome the last three times I have been here. Our server is always friendly and checking with our table frequently. I came here once for dinner, and twice for some apps and drinks with friends. Service was awesome each time. Last time we went, my boyfriend ordered southern tier's IPA, which is 7.3% alcohol. He received it in a 10 oz small glass and asked why it was in a smaller glass (we drink a lot of beer and know that it is usually served in a 16 oz pint glass). We were informed by our server that beers over 8% are served in a smaller glass. My boyfriend then showed her that it wasn't 8% ( in a nice way of course) . She then apologized for her misunderstanding and have him his next round for no charge. Just an example of their awesome service! \n\nThe first time I went, I had a chicken sandwich and thought it was full of flavor! Last month, I ordered their Brussels sprouts appetizer.. Fried sprouts, bacon, Parmesan cheese and balsamic reduction... Mhm! I loved it! Two nights ago I had their sliders- three mini burgers topped with tomatoes, red onion, lettuce and garlic aioli. They were served medium well, weren't as juicy as I like, and the garlic aioli wasn't as tasty as I had hoped , but they were really good. \n\nNow for the best part- their beers! Each time I went they had awesome beers on tap. Currently. They have Elysian brewing punkuccino pumpkin coffee ale ... Pumpkin and coffee in a beer ?! So good!!! It was served with a brown sugar rim which complimented the beer so well! It was smooth, tasty and easy to drink! Everything I want in a beer! \n\nAwesome place! Good food, Great beer, Great service, and perfect location!",401,3
"I tried Yama today because of the sheer volume of positive reviews, but I wasn't impressed. I am a nigiri girl, so my review is just for nigiri. The quality of fish was good (not great), but the cuts were ok and holy moly rice... I felt like I was eating starch for days.. I couldn't even taste the fish cuz there's so much rice!! They're a bit understaff so it takes a while to order and for your food to come. The Mexican lady is also a bit rude when you ask her about things on the menu. I think if more people know about Sakana across the street they would not be so busy. Sorry Yama, think Sakana's got you beat in quality and variety.",157,1
"Checked out the new location of Big Ben's in Southend on a Friday night, and they had a live reggae singer jamming - nice! The space in intimate, very British in decor, and with the high ceilings, an enjoyable place to meet friends.\n\n$4 Boddingtons were the special, and they really poured it nicely (think Guiness at Tyber Creek nice!). Prices were high for shots (4 royal flushes = $36 without tip), but then again this isn't the place you'd normally do shots anyway. Bar tender was nice, but absent and it took a while to get our checks and have her give change. I'd go back, but this won't be my local bar anytime soon.",155,2

"Teachers clearly have no or little schooling to be qualified to handle pre school children.   Maybe just this Tutor Time (I don't know) but this is the worst day care I have shamefully paid for. Credentials for these teachers are high school diplomas, and seems they dress up like clowns more often opposed to having a professional approach. Would not recommend this day care to anyone... Bright horizons is well worth the extra drive.",87,0
"These guys have become so busy that they do not care about customer service. The two girls behind the counter are rude! I asked for a coupon card, and they acted like they don't know what that is. Next time, I told them my drink didn't taste good, and they dumped it in front of me in anger. Seriously, I pay for good service. Finally, I complained to the manager who took the employee's side and didn't hear me out. If this weren't the ONLY place to get a smoothie, I would never come here. But, guess what, I am not coming here, because I do not want to deal with unnecessary anxiety.",141,0
"We ordered the chicken pot pie special. \n\nI liked the pie crust a lot. It was perfectly baked, but the stuffing in the pot pie was not good at all. It was salty and way too thick. \n\nWe also ordered a cheese burger with the meal, because I am just hungry . The burger was better than McDonald's. On the other hand, the fries was hot and fresh. \n\nThe apple pie I was waiting for to be the highlight of my meal turned out to be another disappointment. it was tasteless, apple was too crunchy, and not enough sugar. \n\nWe both agree we would never pay $45 for a meal like this and come in here again. \n\nDon't you hate it when you have to ask for refill on iced tea when your waitress saw a empty glass twice already.",182,1

"Took the drive out to Phoenix hoping I'd finally find some great Mexican food. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered a chorizo, egg, potato & bean Burrito. I gave that a 6/10. What killed it for me was the cleanliness of the restaurant. Dirty tables, salsa spilled on the floor & tables. Plus they said they had horchata...it was one of those OLE fountain drinks. I was shocked. Seriously if you can't make your own agua frescas, I can't trust you to make me Mexican food. I lived in California for 24years, 15min away from Mexicali, Mexico.

"I absolutely love this restaurant when the owners aren't around.  I've been ordering from them for YEARS! The gentlemen that delivers my food has always been gracious and polite.  In fact, every time I've dealt with the staff it's been pleasant.  HOWEVER, every single time I've called during lunch hours and the owners are present, I'm given a hard time.  Today when I called for a delivery order, I heard the lady (owner) in the background yelling at the kid that took my order while I was on hold.  My order was $2 short of the minimum delivery amount.  The kid was told to tell me my location is too far away.  \""Tell them to just come pick it up!\"" she yelled at him, all the while I'm on the phone listening to her scream at him.  This has happened before and quite honestly, the owner should learn some manners and personal awareness.  The poor kid nervously apologized to me as I decided to cancel my order.  Thanks anyway!!! The owner should understand that this city is flooded with Chinese restaurants and be grateful she has such a great staff.",241,1
"What can I say about Henry's private kitchen ? A little disappointed! My husband and I drove here to eat last night all the way from north scottsdale, and was expecting something yummy. We ordered three dishes: oyster pancake, fried chicken tenders, and kejia stir fry with four ingredients. (I had high expectations , because I have been to Henry's kitchen in Tempe a few times and really liked their food. )The only dish I liked was the fried chicken tenders, portion was okay, but it could have used a little more seasoning. The kejia stir fry was the worst, it had dried bean curd , thinly sliced pork, celery and some squid. Some of the pork slices were just completely pure fat! I had to choose and pick through this dish..... Oyster pancake was a mistake on our end. I have never been a big fan of this dish, my husband loves to eat oysters but he had forgotten last time he ordered this he didn't like it. Be aware! If you like your pancake crispy, this is not the dish for you. The oyster pancake comes standard like other Taiwanese places I have tried before, however this particular dish is kind of soggy and it's just how it is. Will I ever come back again? Maybe.. I would definitely not order these dishes again though.",269,2

"Can't believe there are many reviews after my first one years ago. To be honest, I don't go there any more for few reasons. \n\n1. The owner has changed\n2. The foods quality has changed\n3.

Found a better places to have the best DIM SUM in Chandler AZ\n\nOnce very satisfied customer is no longer their customer.

"My friends were playing at the Hard Rock so we chose to stay here for convenience. The room was cute, didn't spend much time in it but to sleep. Got up early to check out the pool but they didn't open till 10am. So we decided we would eat at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast. Bad choice. Food SUCKED! They burnt my pancakes and the eggs were NOT over medium as I ordered. The juice was gross, left a bad taste in my mouth. The waitress barely came by to see if i needed anything, like maybe some water to wash out the juice.\nAnyway... We ate and went back to the pool and the guy said we needed our wristbands which I lost the day before but was told to just ask the concierge and they would replace them.\nNOPE! They wanted to charge me $25 for wristbands to get into their stupid pool!!! Yes i drove all the way from LA to pay $25 for your stupid pool after I already paid for the room. COME ON! I was so disgusted with the attitude given that i wanted to check out and go stay somewhere else. We checked out alright and they charged me a convenience fee that covers the use of their pool and valet!!! WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????? NEVER again Hard Rock! You blow balls! How could you charge me a \""convenience\"" fee.... where was the convenience I got charged for? I couldn't even use your stupid pool.\nSo, we left and went to stay at the Venetian. We had to come back that evening for the show which I almost didn't thanks to their asshole service. I had a good time at the show. Lit and Ant Farm were great. That is the only good thing I can say.\nSo, they get a star for the cute room and a star for the great show which really had nothing to do with them.\nThe end.",394,1
"Best Thai food in Vegas! The worst location, you will feel like you might get jumped in the parking lot. =) But it is totally worth it. Make a reservation and go with a group.

"Please do not stay at this hotel. I would love to share the experience that my wife and I had.\n\nOn December 6, 2014 we went to Vegas to celebrate her birthday. It was a last minute trip and did not book a room in advance as we usually do. \""Huge mistake\""..\n\nWe searched online and saw that Silver Sevens Hotel and casino had vacancy and decided to pull in.\n\nOur first impression was that It looked very ran down, but we were so tired we decided to stay. The hotel desk service was so rude. They did not want to serve us and did not know anything about customer service.\n\nAs we went to the room my mother inlaw and I went to the casino floor to gamble a bit and look around. As my wife was so tired she decided to stay in the room and get some sleep.  \n\nWithin 30 minutes of her sleeping someone came in and robbed her as she was sleeping. They stole her purse her wedding ring and wedding band. The scary factor is that he was only a few feet away. When she woke up she was so scared she contacted security right away.\n\nThe security staff did not show and compassion or concerns of the incident they were rude and unprofessional. The guy got in from the back entrance due to the back door having a malfunction and that's how he got in. \n\nThe priority of every Hotel is their guests safety. Obviously Silver Sevens hotel does not give a rats ass about anyone's safety here because the they don't care to check their doors.\n\nSilver Sevens Hotel is careless and unsafe hotel to stay. Please do not even think about checking in here. You will receive terrible service. And is more then likely you will get robbed.",379,0

I asked for help on Twitter and Curiouser and Curiouser saw this and replied offering their services. I went into the shop, they made a framed mirror exactly as I wanted and of fantastic quality.\n\nIf you are ever around Broughton Street area then I definitely recommend you popping in here. And maybe go to Treacle for some food after :)",147,3
"There are some problems with this place.  They don't include the service which is superb.  The menu is weird, but not too difficult.  The food is a different story.  It's good, but I don't get all the hype.  The chili relleno really sucks!  Super thick cracker crumbs, no sauce, thick yellow cheese, (not completely melted.....two times!!!) and non-roasted chili make for an atrocious relleno!! The Diablo Chicken...good...if you like butt loads of garlic. (Which I do) I haven't found the perfect combo yet.  I'll keep working on it, but don't expect to be blown away, and if you get the relleno after reading this...shame on you...bad foodie.  Don't do it... \nTo end on a positive note....service is outstanding.  Very friendly staff.  You can sample stuff...do it!  I'm giving an extra star due to the service.

"We were just there last weekend and my brother got a horrible case of bed bugs. Good news they comp the room, but he now has an infection. Hooters has not heard the end of this and I will say this on every site I can. He even found a bed bug and took it down in a ziplock bag to show them. He is completely covered in bites they are even all over his face. So this is a warning! The staff at the hotel knows about this, so this is real not just trying to write a bad review.

"Beso is a Mexican-style restaurant with happy servers! I just love the aura and feel to the place- it is just so gorgeous! My friends and I went on a random night before we were to head to a local club, because we were offered a complementary dinner, so we did not get to choose what to eat.  In this complementary dinner though, it included guacamole dip and chips (the best guacamole dip I have ever tried!), ribeye steak covered in horseradish, and caesar salad. The rest of the entree was not necessarily the best of all time, but it was worth the stay and eat! I hopefully will go in and try something on the menu that I choose, so until then, stay in tuned!",150,2
"Nothing worthwhile in 200-level, especially with children, and lower level too much per seat!\n\nOnly worth going here if you have 100 level seats, a possible 'ok' experience if you are club level or 200 rows A-D. Thought my $27 seats were a great deal in section 226, row U at the aisle......I felt almost sick (literally) from the height of these seats; it actually feels dangerous up there AND you get to see almost nothing. I was paranoid about my kids even walking up/down and forced them to sit still (always a challenge) because it really did not appear safe up there.\n\nWe love basketball and were so excited to get 'group rate' tickets and it was so incredibly disappointing. We would only go back for 100 level seats, but I couldn't justify  spending $97 per ticket for a family of 4 for one night!\n\nA small coke (about 16 oz total, prolly 8 with ice) was $5.24!!!!  Geez!\n\nIf you want good parking, the Center City Green Parking deck on E. 6th & the BOA Garage are right next to the stadium and $10 for game parking.  Arrive before 6:30 for a little less traffic, 6pm probably better.

"A pretty typical old school steakhouse - just like a dozen others in LV.  The food was pretty good. We didn't care for the service...they threw food at us and continually interrupted our conversations, and I didn't care for the hard sell on steak toppings or sides. \n\nI won't hurry back.  There are too many other good steak places in this town to warrant a special trip to this one.",92,2

Great NY style pizza is somewhat hard to come by in Vegas, and Grimaldi's continues the legacy of mediocre thin crust pizza in the Valley, especially for the price.  You should also prepare yourself for tons of screaming kids, because the Chuck-E-Cheese down the street was apparently completely full the day I went to Grimaldi's.\n\nIf you want a decent NY style pizza, you're better off getting take-out from Lefty's and saving yourself some money and the headache.",161,1
"I am sorry to say that OHSO was only so-so.\n\nWe came here because it had great reviews and we wanted to check it out.  I am definitely impressed with the selection of beers, especially because I am a big craft brew person.  They also sell and refill growlers which is nice.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and I like that they have a dog-friendly patio (always a plus).  The food was a disappointment though.  I had the brisket sandwich with tomato soup and my girlfriend had the prosciutto flat-bread pizza.  Now, I have had some good brisket in my day so I was excited for a good sandwich.  I was surprised to see that it was pulled/shredded and drowned in sauce.  The sauce wasn't bad but I could not taste the meat itself.  Not sure if they were trying to cover something up or what but less is more when it comes to sauce.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.  The tomato soup was okay, but tasted a little thin like something was missing.  \n\nThe pizza had good points and bad points.  The flavor profile was pretty decent, but I am not sure I would call the meat on the pizza prosciutto.  If it was, it is not anything like I have tasted before (my girlfriend and I are big fans of good prosciutto).  This was but very thick and tasted like a better version of Canadian bacon.  Overall, not bad but not amazing either.\n\nOur waiter was great and made some good suggestions for beer based on what I was looking for.\n\nSo now for the big question...will we be back?  Yes, but only to grab drinks before heading elsewhere or if we have our dogs and want to chill for a couple brews.

"The newest addition to the Las Vegas strip, The Linq, provides a handful of new restaurants for us locals to try. Flour and barley was at the top of my list for wanting to try. Sadly, I was disappointed by both service and food. \n\nService was almost non existent. I understand it's a new restaurant, and most employees are new, and it takes a little time to get in the groove of things. However, the service was too bad to be able to overlook. Our server did not seem to know much about the menu. When asked what their recommendations were, she couldn't even answer because she hadn't had most of the food items. Service was also quite slow on the drink refills. \n\nAs for the food, we started with the baked clams as well as the mozzarella en carozza (Italian bread filled stuff mozzarella, prosciutto, and basil). They were ok. The mozzarella en carozza was basically just a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. The bread had a nice golden brown toast to it and was quite crunchy. However, the inside of the sandwhich left more to be desired. A thick slice of cold mozzarella and a very thin piece of prosciutto did not cut it. The baked clams were decent enough, just a little heavy on the salt. \n\nFor our pizzas, we ordered the Carbonara (pancetta, roasted cauliflower, farm egg) as well as the Calabrese ( meatball, Italian sausage, prosciutto).  The Calabrese was decent enough. The tomato sauce had good flavor and it had a good amount of toppings. It ess basically their version of an escalated meat lovers pizza. The chili verde that also comes on it was a nice addition. As for the Carbonara, well, that was the low point in the meal. I was quite excited for this one, as it sounds amazing, and I'm sure it would've been. But upon receiving our pizza, it was room temperature at best, as if it had just sat out while our other pizza was being cooked. The crust was no longer crisp, just soggy. Super disappointing. Would've sent it back, but l again, service was bad and we could find out server. My party and I all tried to eat a slice, but we left half the pizza untouched. And as much as some of you like to eat cold pizza, it's definitely not what I expect to eat when I'm paying to eat hot pizza in a restaurant. \n\nOverall, would I go back? Probably not, which is a shame. I can already forsee spending many nights at The Linq, showing around my tourists friends or bar hopping with my fellow locals, but I don't think Flour and Barley will ever be a stop on the list.",574,1

Small eat-in area but very clean & Welcoming. The wings are large & meaty cooked perfectly & OH so HOT!!! If you order them HOT be ready they are HOT!!! They have teriyaki style and many other choices. The pizza is the BEST NY style we've had here in Las Vegas and at a great price. Thin & slightly crispy with REAL cheese, well seasoned sauce and REAL pepperoni, not that HORMEL stuff. As soon as we finished we wanted another one.

"Where do I start in saying how fantastic and talented McKenzi Taylor of Taylored Photo Memories is?!

"I cannot stress this enough. If you're trying not to spend a grip on alcohol pre-clubbing or just generally throughout your stay in Vegas, this is a must try. The closest one to where we were staying was at Caesars Palace. Several trips were made back and forth to this place without hesitation. My usual Mango Berry is always on point. I even tried their Cherry Bombs, which were basically maraschino cherries soaked (and I mean SOAKED) in Everclear. Effin' terrible, but I put 'em away like a champ. Found myself another favorite flavor on my last night: The Cat 5 Hurricane. I owe my very first semi-drunken experience on The Strip to this one. For a half-yard cup at $12, you can share it, but I doubt you'll want to. No, scratch that, you wont. It'll be the best amount of dough you'll spend on alkie. Trust!",200,4

"I came in here to ask about sheet music, and sheepishly left when they told me, without any uncertainty, that they only sell piano music.  'But it's the same for violin!' i exclaimed! they were having none of it.\n\nduring my visit, however, I did manage to have a good look around. If you're into piano's and keyboards then maybe you'll appreciate it more than I did. I play the violin so don't know much about the old chords.\n\nThey also had quite a nice selection of piano music too. The staff were very knowledgeable and were playing a really jazzy duet when I arrived. However I was the only customer and I've barely ever seen anybody in here. It's a niche market, and if you didn't know it was here then you'd walk on by",181,2
Overpriced and not at all comfortable. (hard chairs and laminate tables) We tried the buffalo and the angus. It gets two stars because I am a burger and hot dog aficionado. Nothin special about this place. Even the sweet potato fries and chips were ho hum. And what's in that stringy sticky dippin sauce?,70,1
Went there again with some friends wanted to try it so one more go! I said wow wanted to throw that crap on the floor !  I pray I will not go there again ! The deviled eggs were so very bad had to go to the bathroom to spit it out! The story behind it darling go to the Sunday service to see how they help the homeless close this place down! I would love to rip that off over your door jim! My grandmother told me to watch out for folks who did for there own gain! I pray the irs looks into you!,116,0
"This rink is bad. Not outdoor rink bad, but there are places that are soooo much better. \n\nThe rink itself is lumpy, so much so that the puck will occasionally catch air on it's own. \n\nThe benches are fairly worn and beat up, but they are serviceable. I like that they raised the bench area a little so it's easy to jump on the rink, There isn't really any glass separating the penalty boxes and benches so it's pretty sparse on the bench area.\n\nThe bathrooms are seriously horror film. We dubbed them the \""Saw\"" bathrooms.\n\nThe locker rooms are actually pretty decent, no showers, but decent for roller hockey. \n\nI would give this place a two or one normally, but this is the only show in Vegas for Roller so it's both the worst and the best.",186,2
"We purchased a groupon for the seven (7) course tasting dinner.  We frequent downtown and like to try different restaurants.  We were excited about the  restaurant and this tasting menu as we have done them at a few restaurants including Christopher's,  which is excellent! What we were served could not even qualify for an 'appetizer tasting' !!  The salad was small, room temperature and sweet with really nothing else on it! The second course was one piece of asparagus cut into three pieces and wrapped with prosciutto,  I told my husband to be patient as the third course was an entr\u00e9e' course.  It was the SMALLEST THINNEST, (3) 1 x 2 pieces of tuna I have EVER seen!!!!  We said something to the waiter, not really wanting to complain?, and he said the owner was going to stop by our table but he NEVER did!! In fact he went out of his way to  ignore us.  The fourth dish was 2 1\"" x 1\"" pieces of pork and mine was half fat. It came with potatoes that were stacked and hard and little to no cream as they were supposed to be some sort of scalloped potatoes. The fifth course was two 1/4 oz pieces of cheese and a 1\"" x 3\"" piece of focaccia.  The sixth course was a 3/4 inch round truffle and the sixth course was actually a small puff pastry with 'chocolate soup'. We had the wine course which was just O.K..  even though our Red wine came in a white wine glass which we then asked for a red wine glass and the comment was 'That's what the owner wants! Our bill was $195.00 which was a SHOCK and a FLAT OUT RIPPOFF!!!!  The waiter commented about our '$100.00 coupon' so the bill came to $95.00 which is what we owed because the wine tasting, tax and 20% tip onto the original amount (which would be normal but not for what our ONE HOUR tasting DINNER took!!  I do not understand that when an owner and entrepreneur has the opportunity to showcase his establishment to new customers that he takes that opportunity to rip off the customer instead!! ...this is what we received ss our 'dinner'.  We left hungry, VERY DISAPPOINTING to say the least and we just feel RIPPED OFF on top of it!!  If he doesn't want to offer specials....he should just not offer them instead of ripping off the public!!!  I honestly have never written a review like this before and have a few choice words regarding the owner and establishment which I cannot say but wish I could.  It is such a disgrace to his profession and I used to be in that profession!!!  He should be ashamed but I have a feeling he really doesn't care as it is such a small restaurant that he obviously knows what goes on every second he is there!!!  Shame on you!!!",624,0
I tried so hard to like this place. How can you go wrong with a giant pancake? I ordered an apple granola pancake. It contained two ingredients that did not belong - a raisin (not too big of a deal but technically was not supposed to be in the pancake) and a piece of avocado (it was bright green and definitely looked like an avocado - I didn't try eating it). I don't know how those two things ended up in the apple pancakes but I've never had that happen to me at a restaurant. The pancake was decent beyond those two things but way overpriced. I'm sorry but I won't be back. I don't suggest it.,141,1
"For the sake of convenience, I took a shuttle between Phoenix and Tucson. Booking the trip is easy enough, you can pick a time and pay online. Don't expect anything fancy, if anything the atmosphere is a little bit TOO casual.\n\nI boarded from terminal 2 at Sky Harbor airport, and had to ask around to find the check-in desk. The website only offered a general area, with a photo of the desk. It had a map of the airport, but a little marker to show their location would be nice. Someone got a little bit lazy there.\n\nAnyways, the shuttle was a little cramped, but I won't complain, as I'm 6'4\"". Most of you will be pretty comfortable. My only problem with it was the waiting area coming back from Tucson. It was at a gas station with no desk, just a sign in front of a dumpster in the back that basically said to wait at a bench and the driver will have your receipt when he arrives. \n\nI'll try not to rant. This shuttle service will get you where you need to go in a timely fashion. What else is there to expect?\n\nQuick edit: Price from Phoenix to Tucson is $34 in advance, $40 same day, each way.",273,2
I LOVE AYCE sushi and based on the fact that you are a marginally decent AYCE sushi joint will generally earn you AT LEAST 3 1/2 stars in my eyes.  That being said lets explain my one star rating.\n   All those comment about the sushi being average...yeah that's true.  There are soooooooo many good AYCE sushi places within like a 5 minute drive of here.  Sushi in Summerlin...Sushi Bomb....Sushi Mon..and yet this place is just well...lame.  Nothing great to speak of.   Go to these other places...they are better....BETTER. \n  Secondly I don't normally comment on service as I believe it is contingent on a luck of the draw kinda thing.  It's like playing roulette or something.  Unless the owner of the place waits on EVERY table in his joint you could be a great place and still have crappy service.  Plus the waitress' dog could have gotten run over or something and therefore he/she may not be feeling it.\n  But there are several reviews of this place that talk about RIDICULOUS service so I'm gonna hate on the service for a sec.  The audible sighing thing...yeah that happened to me too.  And I just asked for another roll.  It was so blatant that I thought I was at Dick's on the strip or something.  And it wasn't just once it was like SEVERAL times.  Weird Weird Weird.,309,0
"Let me preface this by saying, it's the Verizon Store and I knew what to expect.\n\nI am still waiting for one Verizon Store to come along and surprise me one day.

Not too much to ask for.\n\nThis one was just like all the others; was 4th in line on their check-in, but still had to wait 23 minutes to even be talked too.

"Zine is an upscale Asian restaurant that was labeled one of the ten best in America by Chinese Restaurant News. Chef Simon To, the recipient of the blue ribbon award from my alma mater (can you say that about culinary school?), Le Cordon Bleu, has created a menu bursting with excellent renditions of the more popular items you find on Cantonese, Vietnamese, and other Eastern menus throughout the valley. I would like to try everything on his menu, however, due to the extraordinarily high prices you pay for these renditions, dining here is more of a luxury than feasting on similar versions elsewhere.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered four items. The amount of food was more than enough, but surprisingly, we didn't leave stuffed - a definite plus. We started with the Rare Filet Mignon and Beef Ball Pho ($18), a version of the traditional Vietnamese soup. The filet was  tender, the broth was rich, and the rice noodles weren't over-saturated with liquid. My only regret was that we hadn't ordered the version of the soup without the beef balls, not because they were bad, but because the filet was so wonderful. Likely a traditonal pho would not contain filet, however, so this pho is a particularly indulgent one and the hefty price tag confirms this.\n\nWe then moved on to the steamed Shanghainese pork dumplings ($9.25), which for the record, are the absolute best I've had in town. China Mama on Spring Mountain has been reviewed as having the closest version to those of the incredibly popular Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, but Zine puts those to shame. At China Mama, the technique just isn't down. The dumplings fall apart at the bottom because they are too thin, releasing the coveted broth prematurely, and the crimping at the top is inconsistent and often sloppy. Zine is the only place I've seen that can compare to Din Tai Fung, however, they don't have the great variety of options, a sad yet understandable difference. Unfortunately, they also cost twice as much, but for a Strip restaurant I'd expect nothing less. If I put myself on a food budget, which I really need to get around to doing one of these days, I'd order these alone and wouldn't need much else.\n\nWe finished with some dishes from the \""Chef's Special\"" section, all of which end in $0.80. I think this is supposed to make the consumer lucky. We had the sauteed vegetables ($16.80), which were impeccably dressed in a light garlic sauce and cooked beautifully. The little pearl mushrooms were a welcome and unique variation, however, I was hoping for Chinese broccoli rather than regular broccoli. The Honey Glazed Walnut Prawns ($28.80), a personal favorite, could have come out hotter but were delicious nonetheless. The dish consists of extra large prawns that have been lightly battered and fried and tossed with a mayonnaise based sweet sauce and, of course, honey glazed walnuts. Sounds healthy doesn't it? I found the quality of this comparable to same dish at Ping Pang Pong in the Gold Coast, but due to the fact they cost double at Zine, Ping Pang Pong wins my walnut prawn competition.\n\nOther than the prices, there was nothing about Zine that would make me not go back. Each dish we had was skillfully prepared and well-balanced, so if you see a dish on the menu you've enjoyed elsewhere in Vegas, chances are it will be better here. Just don't forget to eat the lucky dishes so your gambling habit might pay off and cover the cost of your meal.",760,4
"SALTY, SALTY, SALTY!!!!!!!!! Unbearable... I had to Toss my food and then drink a gallon of water to wash out the salt in my mouth. I feel like I was in the ocean and I swallowed salt water. The reason they get 2 stars is the guy on the line was nice.",66,1

The tableside salad thing was kind of cool, I like how they mix it right in front of you. Extra stuff always gets me excited. :)  The free dessert is always a plus as well. \n\nAs for the service... WAY grouchy! Everyone that worked there just looked absolutely miserable. Maybe I should have given them my free rose. Cause they needed a bit of cheering up! :) :)",160,2
"Amazed at the good reviews here. Maybe the heat is affecting their tastebuds? The Sunflower specialty drink was bitter and not shaken well so it was barely cold. When the new bartender came on, I asked him to reshake it and add more sugar to the rim as it was (and I said this loud enough for him to hear) the best thing about the drink - he never even asked if I liked it or not (I didn't finish it). The Jicima salad was tasteless and would have been better as a plate decoration under a piece of fish or chicken. All the raw onion in the salad I, unfortunately, was able to taste for hours. The ribs were just ok. We had to cut our losses at that time and move on to somewere better.  Ambiance is good. I hear the pizzas are good. If I do go back, I'll opt for a pizza and a beer. Then again, there are LOTS of pizza and beer joints that cost a lot less and have good parking.",211,1
For a chain restaurant the food is amazing.  I usually don't order lasagna at restaurants because I end up being disappointed.  The lasagna in meat sauce is great.

"This is a very \""homie\"" type of place. Little plates but very expensive if you want to feel full. It's a family sharing type of place. One time is probably enough.

If you're willing to pay about 400$ for the whole menu to split then this is the place to go. Otherwise I feel this is very expensive and not enough meal for your buck.",109,2

"My husband arrived at the D gates of Terminal 1 at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas with not much time prior to boarding and STARV-ING. There is a serious lack of decent food options that are quick at this terminal. One pizza place, a place to by box sandwiches, chili's too with a 40 minute wait and Quizno's. \n\nWe avoid fast food like a plague for its general low quality, high fat/calorie counts and poor nutrition. We figured a sandwich would be better than pizza, I mean how can you mess up such a simple thing as a sandwich? Ha...ha!\n\nNow I will say this, my husband ordered some sort of cold cut variety on whole wheat that had a lot of ranch dressing on it and he said it tasted pretty good. He was so hungry I think he downed it in 4 bites. I tried to go a healthier route with their veggie guacamole and had it grilled, or was that toasted - I'm not sure - on parmesan bread. Here's my review:\n\nService: friendly and quick. No complaints here.\n\nFood: Ugh. My bread was spongy, tasteless, really gross. The veggies on this veggie sandwich were black olives, TONS of diced purple onions, mushrooms and shredded iceberg lettuce. Does that sound like a veggie sandwich to you?? Does that even come close to sounding appetizing?? Where are the peppers, spinach, tomatoes?? Two layers of cheese, swiss and cheddar with a little squirt of what I think was Italian dressing and barely detectable guacamole all mushed into the lettuce. It just had no taste. A pile of tasteless unappetizing vegetables on spongy, tasteless bread. Odd thing is the sandwich looked great but did not match the flavor. I ate less than a quarter of it just to tame down the hunger pangs and the rest went in the garbage.\n\nTwo stars is for the quick friendly service, I would give zero for the food if I could. Believe me, I am one on yelp who consistently gives the benefit of the doubt to places but I advise you to go elsewhere for food.",446,1
Good dumplings and the beef pies. Dough made from scratch makes all the difference and the flavor is good too.

I give the information to Jeff and he took it but did nothing.  He called later and said the car was fixed. When I went to pick the car up, I found the part had been wired together. When I told him this wasn't acceptable, he became irritated and said \""it was a piece of junk car and it would have broken anyway.\"" He also said that the gear shift was a junkyard part. \n\nAfter being treated badly by at Apache, I brought the car to another mechanic who \nsaid the shifter had definitely been forced. I was also told that this wasn't a junkyard part but had the original inspection number on it. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

"I have been renting a home through the Cunningham Group for over 2 years now, and they've been exceptionally helpful and quick to communicate back to me on any home repairs (both emergency and minor) and requests that I've made.  I really like their web portal, as it's a good way to request repairs and follow up with them, but they are also available by phone if you need to get a hold of someone.  Keep in mind, most property managers are busy enough with the daily work to get back to people immediately, so my understanding has always been that you do have to put in time yourself if you want to see something resolved.  \n\nI've noticed over the years that Yelp reviewers like to complain about a company or business because the follow up is not immediate (maybe it takes 1-2 days) or the Yelp reviewer had to call back several times (oh, the horror). That is isn't a valid reason to complain and it certainly is not productive, because it takes good communication on both sides to get things done or resolve an issue.  If I give bad feedback, it's going to be because of clearly poor service or products despite all attempts to prevent or avoid that outcome.  Having to get in touch with someone several times is just a facet of life, especially in our technology-laden and fast-paced world.  \n\nI'm really happy with the Cunningham Group, and if I decide to buy a home in the area in the near or distant future, I will definitely consider them first because they've been so easy to work with and so responsive to my requests and needs.

One can (and should) dress nicely but we saw many shorts, cargo pants and even a wife beater.  My husband is a big fan of single malt scotch and we were fortunate enough to be served by John who knows more about scotch than anyone we've ever met! \n\nThe food was superb...so much so that I moaned throughout the meal! ;)   I enjoyed a perfectly cooked 8 oz. fork-tender filet mignon, pan broiled rock lobster tail and grilled asparagus.  My husband went for straight beef and tackled a perfectly cooked 12 oz bone-in rib-eye.  We shared a side dish of creamed spinach which was topped with seasoned broiled breadcrumbs.  To finish the meal, we shared the homemade cinnamon bread pudding with a scoop of gelato.  \n\nEvery bite was scrumptious and we were able to enjoy our meal at a leisurely pace. The staff here is helpful but unobtrusive so we were able to enjoy a very romantic time together.  Do not miss this place when you are in downtown Las Vegas!",289,4
"This place was cool - exterior is painted bright, sunshine yellow. Very cheery, yes, but the color doesn't seem to scream \""Irish pub\"" to me - hmmm, I dunno... Inside was very charming - exposed brick and lots of wood - very pretty and \""inviting\"". My date and I had the Irish Nachos - Yumm-meee!! Love the spuds they used too - reminded me of homemade spuds my gramma used to fry up for breakfast.\n\nI had a Blue Moon and it was pretty delicious. They had a band which actually rocked - they played songs from Tracy Chapman, Tomy Petty, etc.\n\nGood place to go - it does get crowded, so I recommend getting there sorta early to get a good spot.",162,3
"Here's an unusual review for Zara. We've been going to Zara stores for years - up in Scandinavia, across Europe including Spain, last month in Singapore and Hong Kong, and so forth. I say it's a bit unusual because we've always \""talked up\"" Zara with friends wherever we go, and now I'm posting a one-star review. It's almost like this Scottsdale Fashion Mall store is not related to the rest of the Zara universe -- that's how different it is. Not only in the selection of clothes (not as trendy, not as cool). But especially, I mean really dramatically, different in the level of customer service. You'll see other one and two star reviews on this site before mine that attest to the same thing. This is just a \""Who gives a ***\"" operation. They literally could care less that they lost a customer with our family who must have previously spent $2,000 to $3,000 in their stores. And all this for a $41 return of a Christmas present. \n\nKnow the store policies carefully before you buy. This is a slippery place, where salespeople, register clerks and \""managers\"" know that their policies create frustration for customers, and they actually appear to take enjoyment out of causing you grief. Here's a case in point . . . My son (our biggest Zara advocate) lives in LA and he bought me a pair of Jeans in the Scottsdale store when he was home for the holiday. Just a few days before Christmas. Well, they didn't fit, so I took the present back untouched (all tags, etc) with my son's original receipt for a refund. Either cash for me or a refund to my son's card would have been fine. But -- when you buy at Zara, you can't just do something so seemingly normal. Instead, you have to have the actual card it was purchased on for the credit (it's a \""theft thing\"" according to management). My wife left the store frustrated and I went back, after getting a text message photo of both the front and the back of his credit card (same last name, same bank and card as my own). I showed the picture of card and my original receipt to them as well, and all they will offer is a credit in their store. \""No refunds for Christmas presents\"" blah blah.\n\nFor a $41 sale, this company and their uncaring management loses a family that had been religiously touting them for years. Now I know why good retail sales managers are so important. You can't put a clerk into a manager's job and expect them to understand that sometimes you have to make exceptions. We'll never be back to Zara and I urge you to reconsider if you are thinking of going to the store yourself.",590,0
"This place isn't bad, but it isn't great either. The only reason I stepped foot into this place was because it was the closest place to get \""real\"" food around the Las Vegas Convention Center North Hall.\n\nThe omelette here isn't that bad actually. If I do for some reason have to eat here, I would just stick with this. \n\nI've tried the fried shrimp and though it was tasty, was getting really salty torwards the end. The fries are just ok too, definitely frozen and not cut at the restaurant.\n\nThe ketchup sitting on the tables needed to be cleaned too. There was a good amount of old residue on every table that I sat at, 4 or so times in a week.\n\nOnly come here if you really have nowhere to go. \n\nI would recommend just going to the Pizza Hut where they serve personal pans just 5 minutes away",197,1

"My husband and I went on Friday to have a couple of drinks and apps at the bar.  We ordered the deviled eggs which were just ok.  The burnt ends, were not burnt and was just a pile of fat.  We also order the pork rinds, the menu states they have a chili lime salt, which I could not taste at all.  The drinks were ok, the bartenders seem to be in panic mode with trying to measure every ounce.  I may go back to try something on the dinner menu but no rush.",113,1
Disappointed.   Looking for tumeric root.  Had it but all was moldy.  And the place smells ptetty bad.,30,0
"This location is appealing due to the seating and open air setup of the establishment that opens it to the street. They have some comfortable seating available and a bar that seats approximately 10.\n\nThe place was adequate during our visit not amazing and not bad. They had a reasonable beer offering, ok well drinks, & adequate service. The location didn't have a lot of visitors when we were there around 11:00PM.",93,2
This is one of the top places to grab a sandwich. I don't even really like ham but there ham sandwich is bomb.  The only sandwich I wasn't a fan of was the one with the stuffing and cranberries and thats probably because I don't like those things anyway.  But I still tried it and it wasn't terrible just not for me. Everything else hear you can't go wrong.,87,4
"LOVE...LOVE...LOVE!!! this is my 2nd time in Vegas and I must say that I booked this hotel cuz of all the great pictures on yelp and trip advisor reviews. n it did not disappoint me at all! the moment we got off from taxi to the check in...everyone was soo friendly n helpful. The room was huge! the most comfiest bed ever! with ipod stereo and automatic drapes, lights, and they even have different lights for different parts of the room! ohh n they even have night lights in the bathroom! man...that room was off the hook! the sofa was big enough to fit 2 ppl there...the bathroom is amazing! dual sinks, bathtub, shower with a place to sit just like in the spa...bathrobe, slippers, hair dryer, qtips, lots of towels, a floor towel just for getting off the shower, toilet and last but not least a flat screen TV!!! OMG! can this get any better?!??!? I can get ready while watching TV! brilliant idea! ohhh there's 3 full size mirrors right when u walk in the room...n mirrors all around the sofa...man! we ladies can never have enough mirrors if u know what I mean...hahhhahhaa..it was perfection =) \n\nSo remember the days of hotels with \""don't disturb\"" paper sign?? well there's no such thing in Encore hotel! there's Privacy n Makeup room button at ur disposal n there's a doorbell! now seriously u have to stay in this hotel to experience this..words could only say so much to imagine it in ur brain but take the action of staying here and u will never look at any other hotel the same way ever again....",360,4
"I stay at Harrahs because of the location -- basically attached to the Sands Convention Center.  Otherwise, I would stay somewhere else.\n\nThe place has aged and is in need of some serious updating and renovation.  The rooms are pretty old and have obvious maintenance issues.  Do they seem clean, however.\n\nThe casino is nothing special.  They do have some of the latest slot machines, but the sports book is very small and there isn't a lot of table gaming.\n\nWe had an incident in which we were locked out of our room due to a technical problem with the door (not the door key).  We waited over an hour at 11pm for someone to get us in the room -- and then we got little apology and no compensation.\n\nThe buffet is just o.k. and overpriced.  The highlight of the place is probably the KGB (Kerry's Gormet Burgers), which is a pretty good restaurant.\n\nIn short, Harrahs is in a good location and is acceptable -- but it needs some work to be good.",231,1
Love this place.  The burgers are great and the ribs were fantastic!  Fall off the bone kind of great.  I didn't even need a knife.  The service was top notch too.\nWe will definitely be back!,50,3
"I'm sorry Sprinkles... I really REALLY wanted to like you... I tried and tried but I couldn't do it. I've now had six different cupcakes from Sprinkles and didn't enjoy any of them...

"customer service  - excellent \npresentation  - excellent\natmosphere  - superior\ntaste  - excellent\n\nOne of my FAVORITE places ever!! \nI got to admit I am a little favorably bias because when I met my boyfriend he worked here as a server and his sister is a pastry chef here.... but HONEST-to-goodness I really do love everything I have ever ordered from here regardless. \nWhen it was at hardrock is was just as good but now at the palms it's more spacious and beautiful inside. I love the fireplace area!!\nEven when we where low on cash my friend and I would come in an just order the french fries (best french fries ever!) Order them with truffle sauce it makes all the difference! Also the shrimp cocktail was one of our favorite just for a snack before going out on the town or whatever.\nFor dinner-I highly recommend the lamb porterhouse, the bison (if they have it sense it's special), or the bamboo steamed fish (which we always ask for halibut and I personally don't care for bok choy so I get spinach instead). They have a new drink there that is SO good I forgot the name but it's a martini which I asked for on the rocks- but was really tangy and delicious! \nThe beef carpaccio is one of the best I've ever had! Endive Salad is really good, I love the point reyes blue cheese! \nAs far as desserts go I know they almost always have special desserts- I'll post a few pictures. One the I really loved and sounded strange at first but was so savory-sweet... was the a caramel popcorn icecream. Not sure if they'll have it as a staple but I hope so! The cotton candy is free and fun to eat with friends, goes to show Kerry Simon has a great sense of humor. \nOkay one more lovely thing to say- the sushi is also really great and the bar is ultra romantic, great idea for a date night... I'll post some pictures of that as well!",437,4
Why is there so much rave about this place? I stopped by here on the way home today and got myself a carne asada arepas. It tasted like the kind of food I'd get at a mexican food truck on the side of the road - delicious but the flavor is because of the fat and oil. I felt pretty gross about myself after eating my arepas. This isn't the type of food for me and I think I will pass on this from now until t = - infinity.,103,2

"We are in Montreal working a conference and another attendee recommended Nyks.  After a 13 hour day on our feet we trudged there from our hotel.  Once in, we knew we were in the right place.  Seated in a cozy booth with drinks delivered quickly we perused the menu.  Everything ordered was great, but to us the standout was the fish and chips - what do they do to make cod so good?  Drinks were well done and service just right.  If I lived here this would be my go to pub.",114,3

Won't be back here anytime soon...there is more staff walking around in the auditorium than customers.......not to mention the entire place is designed wrong for this kind of movie experience. They  have sections with office chairs... Really office chairs.... I don't even have words for it. There are many other great choices in the valley for this kind of content (food and drink with your movie).....and while we enjoyed the movie....I can't say much else good about the place. The reason it is getting two stars instead of one is because the customer service is top notch.....they are very friendly and attentive. Keep all of this in mind if you should decide to visit here....but continue to Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!",196,1

"Not good. Frozen sushi is not real sushi. The portion is fine for a sushi place but if someone makes ur sushi in less than 10 seconds something is wrong. The rice is already attached to the roller by the time the girl take it off the cooker. The ingredients looks and taste really frozen. I dont like bashing new upcoming business but this is basically the Mcdonalds of sushi, fast, frozen, bland sushi. If your looking sushi drive 5-10 more miles for other places such as ibachi, teharu, lis bowl, and others around that has real sushi experience. Pls stay away, but if u love mcdonalds or something like that pls feel free to try them, oh just a reminder i ordered 2 sushi and paid alslmost 20 bucks, 20 dollars in teharu can give u sooo much.",177,0

"Came here for dinner during Restaurant Week on 1/28/14. We were seated in the section to the left of the bar instead of the main dining room. Maybe because we were just there for Restaurant Week? It's an odd spot and made us feel disconnected from the restaurant. \n\nService was great but the food was below average. Everything came out immediately which was great but made me wonder if dishes were pre-plated and waiting to be sent out. My wine had bits of cork scattered all over the surface. Our server apologized and returned with a new glass of wine. She had the bartender fill it to the rim which was great especially because the glass was originally only filled a third of the way.\n\nAppetizers:\n- Fagioli (soup w/ spicy sausage, cannellini beans & hand cut noodles) was ok, nothing to brag about.  \n- Roasted Chicken Risotto was flavorless and the shredded chicken was rubbery. \n\nDinner: \n- Seared Beef Flat Iron (w/cipollini onion, goat-cheese chive mashed potatoes & a cabernet demi sauce) was the best dish out of all the dishes we had. \n- Grilled Lamb T-Bones (w/smoked tomato, cannellini beans, sambuca-shallot marmalade) was disappointing. The beans were undercooked, unseasoned and took over the majority of the plate. But the marmalade was great. The t-bones were really tiny, so not much meat to fill up on. Also, it didn't help that the steak knives looked and worked more like butter knives. So our table shook whenever I tried to cut into the meat! It was very frustrating. \n\nDessert: \n- Molten Chocolate Cake (w/pretzel ice cream) was boring - I've made better ones at home. The pretzels in the ice cream were soggy and not pleasant to bite into. Chocolate covered pretzels on the other hand would have been a much better choice - I've had this in Target brand ice cream (of all ice creams!) which was way better!!\n- The Bananas Foster Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was beyond disappointing especially since our server recommended it. I have a huge sweet tooth, but this dessert was way too sweet. And the br\u00fbl\u00e9e part was even more disappointing - the sugar over the custard did not dissolve completely into a nice hard shell, it was a grainy/gritty mess.\n\nOverall, it was a total disappointment. We normally wouldn't mind shelling out $$$ for a great meal but this was heartbreaking. Don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.",583,1
"i like this new location a lot, it's more local to the strip, spacious, and trendy/intimate than the Westside location that they moved from. they have an outside patio seating area, or you can sit at the huge bar in the middle, or at one of the half-moon booths or tables.\n\nthere's a strongly Spanish and seductive vibe which i'm definitely diggin' - the intimate lighting, red tones, spanish dancers and bullfighter paintings adorning the walls, the uniquely patterned wallpaper, i love it all. \n\ndefinitely a place you want to bring someone special or a Ladyfriend you're trying to impress. good times will be had over their tapas, calamari, sliders, octopus (my favorite), bacon-wrapped dates, etc. the cocktails are on point as well.\n\n-salud!",180,3

"Below average food at above average prices. This is the kind of boring sandwiches you can get anywhere. Aside from the urban/hipster graffiti/sticker/license plate covered interior, there isn't much that's unique.The steak on the Marley sandwich was like the sliced roast beef you can get at any deli. The BBQ sauce that covered it was too sweet for its own good and the bread was dry and crumbly.\n\nMy wife got a sandwich that was equally forgettable. We shared a bag of fries, which were decent, but oily enough to soak through the paper bag.\n\nThere are no tables just counter seating along the windows that overlook the movie theater at Town Square. It's a pretty cool and cozy space. Unfortunately, that's the best thing going for this sandwich shop.",168,1
"This place was just ok. Deserted when we came in, and it took a while to get table service. Our server was pretty brusque, it seemed as if she was in a bad mood. My burger was cooked to a hockey puck consistency but I saw no use in sending it back.

Ceasar salad was a bit heavy on the sauce. \n\nOne of the guests orderd a bottle of spanish wine, not very tasty but not the fault of the restaurant.

"I was in town for a convention so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. It was pretty busy, but the bartenders were all pretty friendly. \n\nI started with the fried green tomato salad. I think it was my favorite part of the meal. It was 3 slices of tomato fried with some mixed greens. It was pretty tasty, though it was $14 for a smallish starter. \n\nThe hen house burger was good, but a bit messy. I am never a fan of a burger that is so juicy that it soaks through the bottom bun and makes the burger fall apart. Then it all goes to pieces and you end up being that guy eating a burger with a fork and knife. Never good. \n\nAnyway, the hen house was tasty. They seem to skimp on the fries though. They were tasty, but the cup of fries you get seems a little small. \n\nAs for drinks, they have quite a few wines and craft beers available, which was nice. \n\nTwo glasses of wine ($20), a salad and burger was $55.",236,2
"The worst !  Brookdale Drive - Rocky River....Always trying to get you to do another eye exam.  Took in my son's new prescription in June to make sunglasses. They wanted to do another eye exam today. They said it had been 2 years since last eye exam.  I explained to them -  I brought in the new prescription in June and you used it on his sunglasses.  The lady kept arguing. My son walked out. I called and finally had to hang up. Also, one other time I told them only an eye exam  not the doctor exam (due to diabetes) they went ahead and did the doctor exam after I was very clear with them not to do a doctor's exam.

Brookdale is the worst for customer service.\n\nLet me add:  Received a call from the manager, December this morning and she said my son did not tell them that he had sunglasses made in June.

"In terms of a doctor's office Allergy Associates provides a great patient experience. The staff at Allergy Associates are willing to assist and depending on the day are usually easy to interact with. \n\nThe reason behind my regular visits to Allergy Associates stems to my asthma coming back with a vengeance after it lay dormant for a few years then the good ol Phoenix allergy seasons brought it back. Anywho, my doctor, Dr. Saavedra is a good man who is accessible to his patients. He's caring, attentive, and inquisitive which is important in his practice.

"My husband and I love steakhouses and of course this was one of the hot spots that we had to try. I had a couple of people recommend this restaurant and I was so excited to try it out when we got to Vegas. The decor is lux and beautiful. Very elegant but not too much. Low lighting created a great romantic atmosphere. Especially the booming of the water fountains at Bellagio.What great entertainment. \n\nWell with all the ambiance I was drooling for what more has to come. The service was great, staff was very nice but it wasn't outstanding for an expensive restaurant especially for Vegas. The bread and butter was nothing to rave about. So come on steak! I'm a Rib Eye fan and always order it so then I can do a fair comparison for the quality and taste of the steak. When the steak had arrived, I dived into it and kept on cutting and cutting. Well it wasn't as buttery as I hoped. The fat on it didn't taste that great. And the meat itself was okay. Don't get me wrong. I did eat a majority of it with the three accompanying sides. 2 out of 3 were good. The mushrooms I would not recommend but the potatoes with the bacon marmalade was very good. My husband didn't think his steak was amazing either but we loved seeing the fountains. \n\nWould I recommend this place? No not really. There are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas this one was not one of them. It wasn't that it was bad but it was just disappointing. The one steakhouse that was unforgettable is STEAK from Gordan Ramsey at the Paris. That place I give 5 stars.",353,2
"Went last night for my birthday. We were a group of 3, and unfortunately, the restaurant decided that we deserved to be squeezed in to a table for 2 by putting an extra chair at the table. We had to move the table to wedge into our seats, and then realized that one of us was sitting directly over a cold vent. Who wants cold air blowing up their crotch for an entire meal? Not us. so we asked to move. We were moved to the table right next to the front door, where we sat on the most uncomfortable bench for the next 2 hours. No cushions, nothing to lean against, just a terrible place to sit for 2 hours.\nWhich is unfortunate, since the meal was so delicious! Had the shrimp and polenta and eggplant and mozzarella to start. They were both great! The shrimp came with a lobster gravy that was amazing, could have had it to drink. \nFor our mains we shared the onglet and the lobster spaghetti. Both were great, especially the lobster. We ordered the bread to soak up the extra sauce, which was the best part of the entire meal. \nFor dessert we had the black forest cake (not so good) and the almond cake (pretty good).\nOverall, the meal was great, but it was disappointing to be seated so poorly. When making a reservation next time I would specify where I wanted to sit. I would suggest the same for anyone reading this.",297,3
"Very interesting and different food choice. Service was adequate - they wanted to know if we had reservations for our party of 8 which I guess seems an acceptable question. They were not quick on refills. Although we got two meat platters for 3 and one veggie platter, we were only brought two platters. We asked the server if we were getting another one of the meat platters but she said that the two meats were combined. Looking at the next table there was a couple with the same amount of food on their platter. Surely they didn't order for six people.... The bill comes and we were charges for three. \n\nThe food was decent. A little bland compared to Indian or other ethnic foods. It is probably legitimate Ethiopian so that could explain it. \n\nYou do get a lot of food for your money that is relatively tasty.",178,2
"I've been putting this review off for way too long, so let's just go ahead and bite the bullet. I hate giving places bad reviews and bringing down their average, but I used Presidential for my wedding and shit was NOT okay. \n\nDad was paying for limos to take everyone from the wedding venue to dinner, and we booked several of them for 1 hour (it should take 15 minutes to get from one place to the other). I figured that by booking 1 hour, we (the girls) would have time to have our limo swing by the hotel to ditch the bouquets, guest book, and my giant train and veil. \n\nAfter the ceremony, the limos were supposed to arrive at the venue at 8:15. 8:25 came and went, and I had to get on the phone with the company. The company called dispatch and said the limos were almost there. Kfine, 10 minutes isn't bad. Weellll...8:40 came and went, and I was on the phone again. The operator told me that limos were already there and had been there for a while. \n\nWhat? Where? I was standing at the front of the venue doors, and there wasn't a limo in sight. \n\n\""Well, the drivers said that they're right in front of the venue.\""\n\nAt this point, I was confused. Very confused. And stressed. Because it was my wedding day. And there weren't any limos in sight! And guests were hungry. And I was hungry. And did y'all (the limo company) even have the right address? \n\nThen I heard one of my bridesmaids yell, \""Hey Ann! The limos are in the BACK!\""\n\nTHE BACK. Great. Thanks for the communication (or lack of), guys. By that point, it was close to 9pm. We didn't have time to drop anything off, and we ended up paying for the full hour. \n\n2 stars for the friendly drivers and the bottle of champagne in each limo. But seriously, 1/3 of a glass of bubbly for each passenger ain't gonna fix this one.",479,1
"I had a hard time deciding between a 1 or 2 star rating.  I went to Bluephies a lot 3 years ago for brunches and lunches and pretty much enjoyed my experience (3-star).  I moved out of the neighborhood and was never inspired to trek up Monroe St after that. However I went last week and the entire experience ranged from average to awful.  \n\nThe awful: The menu was short -- but in my experience that's often a good thing.  I chose the peppercorn crusted tuna steak... ack. This dish isn't for peppercorn lovers -- it's for people to like to eat, drink, and wash with peppercorns.  It was just way too much and sort of spoiled the taste of the meat.  My sides were both strongly flavored, over-spiced, and did NOT compliment each other.  (considering my mouth was on fire from chomping down on those little peppercorny-treats)\n\nThe okay: The service was attentive, it took a reasonable amount of time for our food to come out, the restaurant was clean. My dining companion rated his black bean burger as average. My dining companion and I appreciated that the drink menu had a few unique local beers on it... they were the best part.",271,1

I went here a while ago and it was just a place we had never been to. The food was OK. It was not great but I didn't hate it. I would have liked it better if the crust was thicker and better. I tried a pizza that I had never had before (pineapple barbecue). The sauce wasn't very flavorfully and I heard that the salad was gross. The service was not great as well. She forgot our drinks and we had to ask again. In all it was OK food but I won't be back because I liked it.,118,1
"Ken's has been open since last September (2009) in this location but I personally have been following Ken and Amy from and to different locations for years. They are just that good! Now that they own their own shop it definitely shows their personal style and their commitment to customer service! \n\nThis is a fully equipped shop! Offering everything from the standard mani's and pedi's to all the little extras... up to and including waxing and facials. Staff is always friendly and although usually busy you never have to wait long if at all! \n\nUnlike many places out there this is also gentlemen friendly... so a great place to take your boyfriend, husband, or male friend for a pedi that he won't feel like he's being overwhelmed with estrogen! \n\nI drive from Tempe to go to them... have tried places closer in the past(God knows there is a nail shop on every corner!) but am always disappointed with the results from the others. Quality and the overall experience are certainly worth the extra few minutes on the road!",224,4
"Excellent!! I would give 5 stars for the service, 5 stars for their pricing and variety of services offered, took one out only for a little smaller space than you would imagine in a typical luxurious spa.\n\nNevertheless, excellent facial and wonderful people. You can completely trust your skin in the hands of these expert and experienced estheticians- I did and my skin has seen superb results! What's more the facials include a nice paraffin dip for softening hands and of course massage for shoulders and arms as well. \n\nWhat also worked the best for me is no one here is the type to say all scary  things about your skin just to be able to sell their products- you get what you need and no pressure to do more than what you want to. Love it- going back for sure!",170,3
"How many sushi places does Charlotte have vs. need?!  But why not, my motto is never say no to sushi.  This place has a chic environment, nice location (close enough to Uptown but don't have to worry about parking; good for pre-party dining), and opens late (which is always good for that late night sushi crave).  Been here a few times, and honestly it's nothing too special.  My recap of tonight's experience:\n\nService was average, got seated right away (considering there's not waiting area to speak of, I don't think they have much choice but to get our butts to a table).  I had to look for my waiter to get my glass refilled at least once.  It took awhile to get our food, but we were busy talking so it wasn't a problem.  My friend ordered a last drink and asked for the check, and guess what, he got the check and not the drink. \n\nFood was ok.  But for the price, I have to say the portion is tiny.  One order will not feed a grown person (comparing to Enzo, for instance, where one order is enough to feel somewhat full).  The Dragon Roll came apart a little when I picked it up with my chopsticks.  The rice in both runchy rolls (we had Philly & Spicy Salmon) seem a little mushy.  We capped off our dinner with an order of red bean ice cream (which if you haven't tried, it's the best freaking ice cream flavor... and don't worry, you can get this at any sushi/japanese place, not just here... and they all taste similar).  I have never seen a worse scoop shape of ice cream in my entire dining life.  Bascially it's just one bowl of ice cream mess, but at least it tastes good.\n\nSo I guess I won't be running here, but maybe with a twist of an arm, I will stroll over.",421,2
"If I'm only reviewing the food I would give it about 4 stars but the service was horrid. I ordered the veggie conscious burger and it was delicious, lots of avocado. It came with waffle fries with chili and cocoa powder on them and a side of aioli, delish. Their BLT and spicy chicken pizza is also incredible and worth trying. But back to the reason I'm giving the place 2 stars, the service. My server went way beyond trying to just be friendly and made myself, and my family, completely uncomfortable. He told us that no one likes him and even shared that the restaurant is closing soon (who tells their customers that?!). I think after awhile he realized that he was making us tense and left us alone. After our meal, we decided to check out the small chocolate shop section within the restaurant. The girl giving out free samples of chocolate was incredibly rude. SHE asked ME if I'd like a sample and as I was about to try it she yelled out to me \""You're welcome!\"" Implying that I was rude for not saying thank you. It actually shocked me a bit so I apologized and said thank you. Two seconds after, she did the same thing to someone else. I quickly walked out of there without expecting to ever go back. It's upsetting when you find a restaurant where you actually enjoy the food but their service makes you hesitant to go back. Oh well, they're closing anyways.",301,1
"I'll be back to try the pizza. This place looks like it could be a great neighborhood pizza joint. I stopped in Saturday night for some late food on my drive home from the Coyotes game. Sure, I was the only customer there at 9pm, (the place is open till 11, a plus in my book) but I was greeted promptly with a smiling young guy with an east coast accent (another plus for a pizza place. I was alone so ordered a sandwich instead of a pie, to go. I asked for a steak and cheese, and he reminded me it's much better with mushrooms and peppers..good call, suggesting the works. The sandwich, phenomenal, the service, great!",149,2
"It was ok I guess. I had the huevos rancheros, hubby had the traditional breakfast. \nFor me - the beans tasted like canned beans, the tortilla tasted store bought like mission tortillas & the chorizo was a tablespoon so more beans than anything. My over-easy eggs, sliced avocados & potatoes were probably the only thing fresh. Oh, and the pico de gallo was pretty good. So overall it was alright for the amount of serving you get & $. If you're starving it'll fill you up. Most likely won't visit again.\nHusband said it was bland but did the job (after adding salt, pepper & hot sauce) since he was starving.\n\nApart from the food, the service surpassed the food! :)",154,1
"I recently went to this dry cleaners to have  my clothes dry cleaned, two pairs of pants hemed and a sweater sewed. The dry cleaning I received on time but when the day came to pick up my pants and sweater, (12 days later) only one pair of pants had been hemed. When I questioned the young girl at the counter her response was \"" oh the lady who does the alterations hasn't been coming in\""........\nReally! I only had to pay for the one pair of pants that were done, and the dry cleaning. I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone who's in a hurry or wants there clothes done in a timley manner. Very UNPROFFESSIONAL! I am not IMPRESSED.",151,0
"The food is decent, nothing to really go crazy about and not really worth the price. but it's decent and close to work so that makes it easy.\n\nthe biggest issue i have is with the service. after multiple visits i have come to the conclusion that the servers and employees are friendly but it takes 1.5 hrs to have lunch. and that wouldn't be a problem if i thought the food was spectacular enough to wait that long. and our drinks are almost always empty and the servers are hard to find. \n\ni'll most likely continue eating here every now and then bc it's convenient and it's easy to please everyone... but i wouldn't really go out of my way to go here.",154,1

"After a ton of hype, I have to say this joint lived up to my expectations.  I tried the Brisket and Pulled Pork.   The Brisket was moist and broke apart so easily, very succulent.  I drenched in their signature tomato based bbq sauce which was my favorite part of the meal.   The pulled pork was good as well but the brisket was so much better.  I felt the bun on the sandwich could have  been toasted more as it was kind of dry.  I will definitely be back to try their ribs, the customer service was excellent.",117,3

"OMG, if you'd told me I'd find excellent Thai food in a strip mall in the burbs of Vegas, I'd never believe you. But, it's true that only about 7 miles from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas strip exists a wonderful oasis of Thai food with quiet, casual ambiance. \n\nI found myself really enjoying the peace and serenity of the Pin Kaow food. We had the Red Curry and the Pad Thai which come on a 1-10 scale v the traditional 1-4 or 1-5. I would recommend ordering higher than normal unless you want bland food. The Pad Thai is a toolkit v a completed dish. The nuts come on the side v being cooked into the dish. I found this odd. Understandably, people have food allergies, but usually the question can be asked if the server feels the diner may be unable to read. Whateva, I assembled the Pad Thai. \n\nThe curry was a winner, solid 5 star. I will absolutely be back to the wonderful little establishment. (Apparently, there are now 3!)\nBTW, get here early as it gets packed!",246,3
"My husband and I wanted Thai food for our quick lunch date. I found this place on yelp and thought we'd give it a try. From the outside it looked small but once you walk in the place is actually quite big and looks nice.\n\n I ordered water to drink and he got pink lemonade. This is going to sound crazy, but that water was disgusting. It was stinky and had a horrible after taste. Seriously! Water! I got nervous because I've never had \""bad\"" water while eating out. My husband's drink had the same fully after taste. \n\nI had the corn and egg soup. It wasn't bad or good so that was kind of a wash. \n\nMy husband hand the chicken chili mint. That's his favorite Thai dish. It didn't really look or taste like the traditional chicken chili mint. It wasn't really spicy and was covered in a thick sauce which is not normal either. I had the General Taos Chicken lunch meal that comes with, fried rice and crab rangoon. \n\nThe Chicken was good at first but half way through the extremely sweet taste was too much. It was almost like it was covered in a marmalade. The crab rangoons which are always my favorite were also extremely sweet in the filling. It was almost like frosting in taste and texture. Not pleasant, so I didn't finish the 1st one let alone touch the second. The fried rice was bland. I mean really bland. It was eating white rice that just looked brown. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be going back there at all. I guess we've been spoiled with the food at other places like the Bangkok Orchid in Green Valley.\n \nNow if I could just get this awful after taste to go away! It's been a few hours!",391,0

"I ordered online delivery, fail. Spent $40.00 including tip because I had no cash to tip at the door I prepaid. Cream cheese poppers and two liter Mtn Dew were the stars of my order, the soup was so so, the rest was a let down. Last time I ordered a month+ ago they let me down, second chance was worse. Ordered easy items so I could maybe get it in a timely fashion. Polish dog w/cheese and side of FF, hotdog, soup, poppers, cheesecake, Mtn Dew. Added $7+ tip thinking it would encourage proper service, NOPE! No hotdog, no cheese on the polish dog, none of the requested condiments, cold fries and luke warm dog, cheesecake tastes like it's been sitting in the walkin too long and it took an hour to get this disappointment. The poppers were warm enough to eat which is okay cause most of the time the scolding hot cheese squirts out and burns you, and the Mtn Dew was cold for two stars.",218,1

In the past 5 years, two of our children have completed their braces (one with traditional metal and the other with Invisalign Teen) both with spectacular results!! Our younger son will be starting braces in a few months and is looking forward to it - now that's a great orthodontist :) \n\nAdditionally, Dr. Santucci consulted with us when a pediatric dentist was recommending extractions for one of our younger children. We were concerned that doing so might cause future orthodontic problems.  He took the time to explain what was going on in our child's mouth and what we could expect down the road so that we could make an informed decision (we chose to not have the teeth extracted and everything turned out fine for that child). \n\nWe highly recommend Santucci Orthodontics to all our friends and family!",187,4
"For a brief time, this building was occupied by a different restaurant (if memory serves, it was Johnny Carino's, but it was gone so quickly, I don't recall). Regardless, shortly after building, they were gone, and not too long after, Mi Pueblo came in, remodeled and opened as a generally Mexican-themed establishment.\n\nThough overall the place looks pretty - not really Mexican, but not horrible to look at - you are probably best off if you look around, perhaps snap a few shots for Instagram if that's your thing, and leave.\n\nThere is plenty of room here on just about any occasion, and that could be one of their downfalls. I don't know if they are ever properly staffed, but when we have been, they just don't seem to be able to provide particularly good service.\n\nTheir web site says they have eleven locations (one coming soon), so I think they would be pretty good at this item if they have so many, but what I have personally experience, and seen in other reviews? Not so much. You get your requisite chips and salsa and everything else goes downhill fast. Take a trip to New York and practice hailing taxis, as that skill will come in handy when getting someone back to your table.\n\nWhen you eventually get your food - not what most would expect at a \""Mexican\"" restaurant - it's decent enough, but probably not enough to merit a return trip. Something out of the ordinary, and perhaps more than enough to decide to avoid Zaxby's across the parking lot? Sure. But to detour from Azteca or La Unica, not too far away? Probably not.",353,1
"I reserved a table for 6 people weeks prior to ensure we get a spot when we came and we still had to wait about 40 minutes to get seated regardless. Wasn't sure why the reservation was even taken if we still had to wait. \n\nThen we had a problem with seating because they were basically telling us we had to sit outside instead of providing a table that was first available indoors. \n\nWe ordered several app's and individual meals for the group and were disappointed with most of the food we ordered. The food was overcooked and had no flavor. Their menu doesnt bring any creatively and doesnt give options that are worth coming to this American Brasserie versus any other american style restaurant. \n\nAdditionally, they added on a franchise fee to the bill which seemed odd.

"Executive Summary: Food's not great, but it's quick, it's really, really, really cheap, and it fills you up.  Did I mention it's cheap?\n\nNo, Yoshinoya isn't the greatest food.  It's not haute cuisine.  In fact, it's probably just barely edible, but when you consider the price/value proposition, Yoshinoya should be on the top of your fast food list.  How much does a value meal at your typical fast food restaurant cost?  Probably $5-6 (depending on what size you'd prefer your cholesterol delivery system).  For $6, you can get a crappy burger, fries, and a soda.  What can you get at Yoshinoya for $6?  You can get a steaming bowl of rice, topped with hot beef and onions, a dessert, and a soda.  If you could go without the soda and desert, you could walk away from Yoshinoya spending less than $4.  It's a great bargain.  Yes, the chicken has the same texture as the styrofoam container it's served in, but it's still more fulfilling than a Big Mac.\n\nIf you're on a budget, and you're in a hurry, and you're sick of burgers, go to Yoshinoya and you'll think twice about ordering a value meal ever again.  Bonus: UNLV students get a $3.99 beef/chicken bowl and soda.  Bring your student ID.",327,2
"I really wanted to like Egg Works.  Especially since they have \""Cincy Chili\"".

We were quickly seated and our server (young man on Saturday dayshift) was attentive and funny.\n\nThe food - On the first visit I tried the Cincy Chili.  It just wasn't good.  On this visit, I went with eggs, biscuits, and gravy.  It wasn't good either.  You can't really screw up eggs, but the gravy and biscuits had all the thrill of cardboard.   To my server's credit, he noticed I wasn't eating much and did offer to replace it with something else, but I didn't have time as I had an appointment.  My dining companions got the egg skillets and also commented that they felt it was just average food.",206,1

I got a level 8 spicy and most of the time at other Thai establishments I'm disappointed in the lack of spiciness even when I get a level 8, but I can honestly say it was satisfactory level 8 spice worthy - which I truly appreciated.  \n\nIt was jumping for dinner and it's BYOB so stop by the wine and spirits store beforehand!",163,4

"Folks are very friendly.. sort of like a lot of happy dust spread around at Disney.  While it is great for kids under 12-years as they get older it is of less interest.  Water park can be appreciated in ONE day... it will wear you out more than one day.  The Hurricane ride is the BEST.  Rooms are nice but nothing special... when you book... go for the least expensive room, they all have balconies.  Go with a full wallet, things are very expensive in this all-inclusive place.\n\nWe stayed 2 nites... probably a mistake, since we had our fill of the water park after just a few hours.  could have stayed someplace else for less.\n\nFor a family place the in-house restaurant that offers breakfast to mostly kids and families strapped for cash with the expense of this venue should offer a better deal.  $12+ per person is a bit steep for just breakfast.  Offerings are typical but nothing spectacular to warrant this cost.  The gal working the grill added cheese when I asked no cheese on my omelet, and would it have hurt her to smile a little?\n\n2 adults and 3 kids... our bill came to $56.  That is a lot for breakfast.  And we ate light so as to enjoy the indoor water park.\n\nKeep you eyes open for specials...

I was a bit disappointed, maybe I had higher hopes with the cover charge and the line outside.  We left about midnight - so who knows maybe it got more fun later on.  I'm sure its still a fun place to gather with friends and have a good time - whether you want to chill on the patio, listen to the live band, or dance in a loungey place upstairs.

The baker that help us out said that they usually have them freshly baked in the morning around 7am and again at 2pm. So next time we head there, it will be bright and early! haha.

"Placed order with Eat24. Took nearly 45 minutes to get my order- got the impression that they didn't even start cooking it until I showed up. Food quality is very mixed- tasty dishes with low-quality ingredients rendering the dishes themselves poor.\n\nTHAI CHICKEN WINGS appetizer- tasty six-piece order of wings with extra sauce, delicious aroma was a bit better than the actual taste. \n\nKANA MHOO KROP (roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and oyster sauce)- portion is half the size of other entr\u00e9e ordered, and pork used in this dish is either super dry/old or fatty. Could not eat the protein in this dish. If I wanted just Chinese broccoli, I would have ordered that. I didn't pay $10 for this dish to consist of pork jerky and broccoli. I will say that the sauce was tasty though.\n\nPAD SEE EW- ordered this medium heat with beef and it was a huge step up from mild and the protein was also tough in this dish. Overall it wasn't bad though. \n\nTOM KHA- soup was delicious! Pleasant surprise. Good size portion, good complexity of flavor, plentiful tomato and mushrooms. Unfortunately, also plentiful chunks of ginger, comparable in size to the pieces of chicken. Tasty though!\n\nService was polite but very slow. Placed order, waited 15 minutes to leave, arrived around 25 minutes after placing order. Waited an additional half hour. No other patrons were present. \n\nOrder also asked for an additional cup of oyster sauce on the side, but they were unable to do so, saying that they didn't have packets of this condiment. I asked if it could be put in a small plastic cup, they said they couldn't do that because they have the oyster sauce in a huge gallon-size container in the back, and they would have to open the container in order to get me some. I'm baffled as to how on earth they managed to get the sauce into my dish but are completely unable to put it in a cup.\n\nFood quality was such that it seemed a great recipe was being used for these dishes- someone clearly knows their business with this cuisine.

"I must fill you in on a Little back story before I tell you about my experience with Fletcher's Tire and Auto...\n\nA month or so ago, I had to get a mobile locksmith to come to me because my car wasn't starting with the key I had. While the mobile locksmith was making the key, I had an emergency call and had to leave right away. He didn't finish the key, but I put the key he was in the process of making in my car...forgetting all about it.\n\nForward to today...

We told them that we were gonna take our car and get a second opinion... they gave us our key back and we were on our way. We tried starting our car with the key we left for them and it wouldn't start. We used the master key and it started right up. ( I had given them the key that the locksmith made for me, not knowing it wouldn't start my car. )\n\nWhen we got home, I called Fletcher's back and asked them if they had any problems starting my car up ( damn well knowing they couldn't start my car! ) and his response was...\"" nope, it started right up. Didn't have a problem with it at all.\"" how could that be when the key we had given them didn't start my car at all?!!!\n\nKnowing that they were dishonest, we knew we weren't taking the car back there for the repairs it needed. Long story short, We ended up having it fixed for $108.00 AND FLETCHER'S WASN'T EVEN CORRECT WITH THEIR DIAGNOSIS!!!!!! It turned out it was something totally different AND WAY CHEAPER!!!!! What they said was wrong with my car wasn't what it was AT ALL!!!!!\n\nI will NEVER take my car back there again. I need to trust the people that work on my car!",513,0
"This place is good.  I have nothing bad to say...it's your standard brewery type place...although the menu is the like the size of Cheesecake Factory's.  Depending on how busy it is, service can be really good, to fair.  We don't go out of our way to go here, but if we're in the area, we'll drop in occasionally.",84,2
Small trattoria tucked away in an Albertson's strip mall. Look for the big yellow shoe/car in the parking lot that is right next door to this wonderful Italian food nook.\nFresh dishes with just the right amount of spices! I always bring friends there and they love it!,60,3
"Not a high end mall with many bargain stores as well as chains but hey, who doesn't love a bargain, especially in these hard times.\n\nThere are also enough food outlets and entertainment options - movie theatre, IMAX theatre and arcade - to while some hours away.\n\nMy parents, sister and I found it a very satisfying way to relax and chill out for a few hours. My mum loved looking for bargains - it's a Malaysian genetic trait!",98,3

"The specialist I have been seeing for my knee injury prescribed me physical therapy and suggested Select Physical Therapy because they are in close proximity to my home. Good choice, then I don't have to drive all over town to get to PT like I do for the Knee guy (he's worth it don't get me wrong.... I just prefer not to suffer the stress of getting too far from home while everyone else in Vegas is driving).\n\nI will say that the best medicine here is listening to what they tell you to do and not getting in too big a hurry to get \""better\"". Physical Therapy takes time and its best to follow the instructions that you are given b/c these guys know more about getting you better than you yourself do (I think I put this in here just to remind myself to listen to my own advice :-)). The therapists here are great. Good personalities that jive with mine. Very Knowledgeable as well. The best time to come for me is 5-6pm on Tuesday/Thursday because I get the whole place to myself :-) \n\nLooks like I am in this for a little while longer so if anything changes, I will be sure and update. and I am here on Tuesdays and Thursday currently until told otherwise",260,3

"Overall, not impressed. My family decided to something a bit different this year and went to a new restaurant vs. going to old standbys. After finding a list of top restaurants online, we ended up settling on Destihl due to the large menu with seemingly lots of tasty options.\n\nWe made a reservation for a Monday night and we were seated right away. Parking can be a bit difficult mid-evening. We had to circle around the nearby city lot to finally find a spot. \n\nMy order: Chorizo stuffed dates to share and Thai steak salad.\n\nOther orders: Clam chowder (the soup of the day), House salad, Spicy Thai shrimp, and Pesto Chicken (recommended by the waiter).\n\nThe dates came out first. I didn't realize they were going to be wrapped in bacon. But score, I love it that way. The bacon needed to be cooked a bit more though. They had a nice kick to them. They were enjoyed for the most part, but these are much better in Atlanta.\n\nAs for main meal, the accidentally brought my mom a Caesar salad instead of the House salad. She was going to order it but changed her mind. The waiter forgot to write down the change. He came out quickly to apologize after it was delivered. The salad is a wedge salad with a crispy toast in place of croutons and a fried egg. My mom wasn't excited about the fried egg and gave it to us. I tasted it but didn't like it so passed it on to my brother. How do you mess up a fried egg?\n\nMy Thai steak salad was not very good. The steak was cooked more medium than medium well. There was not much of it. The greens were kinda soggy. The peanuts were way too salty. Much better in Atlanta, again.\n\nOverall, portion sizes were adequate and we got our fill. We signed up for a rewards card that evening and were able to apply the purchase that we had just made to our rewards card. That was great. Even though I may not be back. There were plenty of other options that seemed great on the menu, but hesitant after this experience. Plus there are other places to try in the city.\n\nEveryone else liked their food. So that's something. I was going to give them 3 stars given everyone else's satisfaction. But then I realized that I had noted in our reservation that we were celebrating my dad's birthday. They didn't do anything to signify that. Not even a happy birthday. Nothing! So 2 stars it is.",543,1
"I've been here a few times. \n\nThe good:\n- Very strong drinks. Almost, if there is such a thing, too strong.\n- Our first order of cheese curds. Hot, gooey, greasy.\n- Cheese soup + chunky tomato soup = delicious bowl of soup.\n\nThe bad: \n- Slooow service.\n- Our second order of cheese curds. They were made with a different kind of cheese than the first (?) and were rather cold.\n\nI wonder what will change now that they're under new management.",125,1
"I like to shop and occasionally I like to go to a Mall to do so.  I hadn't been to Northlake in some time but I decided to venture out there over my holiday break.  Nothing fantastic about the mall, typical with teenagers running amuck, standard crowd and typical anchor stores.  The traffic in and around this place can get kind of hectic though.  Food court was a little sub par in my opinion but there are some decent places to eat around the perimeter of the place so that will suffice.  A very meh mall.",114,2
"They don't have very many beers on tap (4 Blind Pig beers and a couple others). There is no table service and attempting to order, when crushed between people at the bar, is awkward. The atmosphere is dark and pub-like but nothing special. The crowd is a mix of wanna be hipsters and dudes in wool sweaters with beards. If you are looking to meet guys who play video games in their mother's basement then this is the place for you.  I wouldn't come back here on purpose.",108,1
"Great atmosphere. The service was adequate despite the throngs of grey haired snowbirds and restless teenagers forced to text and pout while their parents got blitzed on sangria.

"I've always been pretty suspicious of tapas restaurants. All to often restaurants use \""tapas' as an excuse to serve up small portions at high prices. And while Julian Serrano is no exception to this, the small plates of deliciousness served up here are worth it if your a tapas fan.\n\nCouple of items I definitely think are worth checking out: goat cheese lollipops, Spanish sliders, brava potatoes and of course churros for dessert. However beware, the ribs here nothing but flavored fat. The food was delicious without a doubt, I could probably eat most of those dishes again without hesitation. \n\nJulian Serrano like the other restaurants at City Center looks great. Nice open spot, very hip and service was nothing to complain about. Hit up OpenTable to get a reservation unless you like waiting.\n\nJS is definitely more expensive than some of the other tapas restaurants around the Strip, but hey... you are eating at Aria after all. Around $10-$20 for most plates but the portions are small. I couldn't help but be disappointed at how small the plates were. Each tapa usually translates to only 2-3 bites when sharing with the table. I doubt anyone can leave this place satisfied for under $40. \n\nLast minute tip: check out M-life to see if they have promotions for this place. Bringing down the price makes JS definitely worth it!",293,3

"\""I want to be like her when I grow up!!\"", was my mantra that evening while in the Forty Deuce club. We ended up here while club hopping through Mandalay and once again we got in quickly and for free. (Thanks again, Maurice...you the man!)\nThis place was full, but the vibe was fun, with everyone grooving to a blues brothers-esque band on stage playing some sassy music. We got our drinks served by a cranky but efficient bartender and we made our way down to the stage just as a dancer came on. I have never seen burlesque live, only having seen it on tv with Dita von Teese, but seeing it live is a whole different experience. The woman who performed was a phenomenal dancer and I didn't know people could bend the way she did. I liked how she played with the crowd and it was fun to watch both for women and men. The second dancer was also fabulous, opening with her leg lifted and her foot resting on top of the doorway so she was in a standing splits. Wow. She danced to this phenomenal led zeppelin montage done on the sax and once again I was fascinated with her sultry dance moves mixed in with interesting gymnastic techniques. What really got me is I didn't know you could do all these complicated moves on a fringe curtain....wow. I want to be able to do all that when I grow up too....though I don't see that happening. \nAfter the second dance we left because it started to get crowded, but it was good fun and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Thanks Forty Deuce!!!",333,3
"The Phoenix Public Market has come a long way since my first visit about four years ago... At the time, it was just a small handful of vendors in a parking lot.  Now, it's a large handful of vendors in that same parking lot, but it's covered with tarps for shade, and they now also have a large indoor area with a coffee shop, grocer, produce, sandwiches, etc.\n\nWhile I admit, we typically frequent the Old Town Farmers Market since we live super close, we like to mix it up every now and again and head downtown.  We've purchased eggs, produce, popcorn balls, gluten free treats, fresh bread, and more, and I'm sure we'll continue to visit every now and again.\n\nI'm proud to see how far this market has come over the years and hope they'll continue to thrive with all of the growth downtown.

"I tried Yum Yum right before a movie at Tempe Marketplace.\n\nI ordered a combo plate with chow mien, orange chicken, beef broccoli and BBQ pork. You can get several types of combo platters with either chow mien, rice or fried rice.\n\nThe chow mein had almost no flavor. Probably the worst chow mien I can recall having in some time or ever.\n\nThe Beef Broccoli was good and flavorful, but not means exceptional. I wish there was a bit more beef.\n\nThe BBQ tasted pretty good, but had quite a bit of fat/gristle on my pieces. Not a fan of that. I had to nibble around the fat pieces. \n\nThe orange chicken was superb! I would go back for this item.\n\nCompared to other buffet, fast food Chinese places, Yum Yum falls short in the number of menu items and quality of their food. \n \nThe dining area is pretty big and has a TV. Drinks are from the fountain.\n\nOverall, some menu items were good, but others were sub-par.\n\n2.5",236,1
"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.",985,4

"I been to cobblestone auto spa for 2 years and I realized this is a much better car wash in terms of pressuring car salesmen. The place is more relaxed and less people get their car wash done here. They claim they even do a better job here than cobble stone since their work volume is lower.\n\nWe got an oil change and a full service car wash for 22$ which was a good deal. The oil change they use is a shell synthetic blend oil and the mechanic does not try to trick you. He takes samples of the oil that needs to be replaced and shows us what color the oil should look like. You can also see the workers working on your car via window while your waiting.\n\nAlthough beware like cobblestone though, they try to get you to replace the windshield and restore your headlamps, even though there is nothing wrong with them.\n\nBut overall, I definitely recommend this place, it's cheap and great for people who live nearby.

I scheduled an appointment with Jen for a haircut. I had never used her before, but she had a time slot open during my schedule so I took it. I was trying something new, and getting bangs. I showed pictures, and was pretty clear in what I wanted - which was long, side swept bangs and long layers. That is not what I got. My bangs were cut too short, so now I have bangs straight across and not side swept. I was told because my hair is not damaged (I've never dyed it) my hair won't look like the pictures I showed, or stay in the position I want. Too bad I was told this after my hair was already cut. When I asked her to try to fix it, she told me to \""go home and play with it\"" and pretty much ushered me out the door. I thought I was paying the experienced hair dresser at the salon to \""play with it\""... but hair grows back, andI'll be looking for a new place to cut it when it does.",253,0

"One day, my wife and I were out, and she told me we should go to this place. She said she had been there seven years ago, and it was very good. \n\nI told her that \"" a lot can change in seven years\"", and I was right. \n\nWe both agreed that this was one of the worst Chinese meals we ever had.\n\nThe staff did try to please, but they just could not over come the bad food that came out of the kitchen. We ordered a curry dish, kung pao chicken, and a shrimp dish.\n\nMy wife took one look at the curry dish and said, \""When I saw it, I knew we were in trouble.\""  She was right. Poor quality ingredients, and no taste to it.\n\nThe Kung Pao Chicken, a standard which I use to compare Chinese places, was awful. My dogs turned down the left over chicken; The peanuts were few, and tasted like they were purchased from a ball park, six months after the season ended, and the dish tasted liked it was cooked in Motor oil.\n\nRemember those terrible shrimp that are in those 99 cent cocktails in Downtown Casinos? Ever wonder where the ones they reject go? This is the place!!\n\nTop off the food with booths where the fabric is torn apart and needs replacement, and you risk sitting with a spring up your butt, and you have a perfect picture of \nKung Fu Thai and Chinese. \n\nGo across the Street to Krung Thai.

The prices for the lunch specials range from $7 - $11, depending on what you order. It's high quality food for the price. There aren't a lot of good restaurant choices in Casa Grande, so I am thrilled that Picazzo's has a location there. \n\nDefinitely sign up for their \""Power Card\"" while you're there.

"I never write reviews on Yelp, but figured I needed to for Feng.  I was pulling for them when it first opened, so when I saw the reviews I was excited to try it.  After purchasing a Groupon for them I decided to head down for dinner.\n\nWe rolled in around 6pm to notice it was a ghost town.  We ordered an app, some rolls, and a dinner bento.  The dumpling app was good but no better than you could make at home with frozen dumplings.  The spicy salmon and Mt. Washington rolls were less than bland, and had some odd textures.  The beef negimaki tasted fine, but there was just thr thinnest strip of chewy beef wrapped around a thick bushel of scallions.  Again, it did not have the correct texture one would hope for.  The salad and miso soup that came with the bento were sub par, and I did find a gnat floating in the soup.\n\nMy assumption is that they haven't been as busy as they would have liked to be, so their \""fresh\"" ingredients have sat for too long.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong items and should have stuck to the hibachi.  Even with the Groupon I felt it was overpriced for what you received.  I'd rather go to Little Tokyo or Nakama where I know the quality of the food.  If I'm going for cheap Asian food I'd rather just go to Szechaun's in Oakland, at least it is going to have some flavor.\n\nI'd say take all if the reviews for Feng with a grain of salt - including mine.  Perhaps if they get busier the quality will be better.  Maybe I went in on the wrong day, or like I said got the wrong items.

We are waiting for a bid and then will get work done as this is a honest, affordable and friendly company.",97,4
"Never go to this smiths during the late shift. I was shopping here from 10:30-11:30PM Friday. I had a cart FULL of groceries ($240 worth) and I was looking for someone to check me out. I asked the only lady at the front if she could help. \""No, you have to do it on your own\"" was her answer before she turned and walked away. Apparently dusting is more important than helping customers! On top of this, 10 minutes later a different employee started checking people out! I was already a third of the way through my groceries and had bags on the floor full of my stuff, because it wouldn't all fit on the self check out counter. Which of course caused the thing to demand I put my items back in the bagging area every time I took them off to make more room (rendering the thing inoperable for at least 30-60 seconds). The most egregious part was that the lady who refused to help me was 35+ and the kid who started helping people looked 17. I guess wisdom doesn't always come with age. Some people get off work late and need to go grocery shopping then. It doesn't mean we deserve any less customer service.",266,0
"Worst Happy Hour. EVER. In fact, my group of friends labeled it our \""Friday UNHAPPY Hour\"".\n\n1. The music is INSANELY loud, prohibiting a normal conversation even if the person is sitting right next to you. \n2. The DJ is absolutely TERRIBLE.\n3. While the free food concept is great......it was all kinda gross.\n4. The server acted like she was doing us a favor.\n5. The mix of people is really odd and kinda creepy. Old creeper men, weird ghetto younger men, and just a few of us business types. Really not the scene for a happy hour with business associates or 'sophisticated' friends.\n\nThe ONLY good thing I have to say is that they can't mess up tequila.",166,0
"I really want to like this place but can't justify going anymore b/c I always leave hungry. In fact, every male I know that has been there says the same thing. The food is very good but portions are way too small. I always get double meat but still leave hungry after spending about $15. I understand the \""we serve smaller portions to fight obesity\"" or whatever. I'm not obese, in fact I'm 510 160#. I exercise a lot and require a lot of fuel. Your portions, even when getting double, just don't cut it. Sorry Chop Shop.",132,1

We came for a bachelor party and had a party of 23 guys, which you can imagine could get out of hand. They put us in a private room and took the best care of us! We got there late around 10pm and the kitchen closed at 10:30 but that didn't stop them from taking care of us and we never felt rushed. We left around midnight and there was no one left in the place except for us. If your looking for a great dinner this is the spot of the strip!",136,4

"We visited the store for an eye exam in early November 2014, everything went well and we seleted some glassses on display. After 2 weeks I called and was told the glasses are in. But in reality they were not, The staff suggested we purchase a different style. Turns out my glasses had not et been ordered. I complained and then had to wait until just before Christmas week to get my glasses. They never called me, I called to cancel my purchase and was told my glasses are in. When I went to pick them up no apology for the 6 week wait, very bad service. I would suggest you try somewhere else. No need for a customer to have to call multiple times to get service.",150,1
"We stopped by here at the beginning of our road trip and got 4 buns: Japanese hot dog bun, ham and egg bun, taro bun, and curry beef bun. Overall we thought the buns were about average; not too outstanding in flavor nor was it terrible. Personally I thought the bun itself was good, but they skimped out on the filling, especially for the ham and egg bun. Other bakeries I've been to definitely have a lot more meat for the same size bun. But if you're on the go, this is a great option for a light meal or big snack.",123,2
"This was a pleasant surprise. Now mind you this area is a little wierd and not exactly a first date kind of place. Its inside the Eureka Casino and in a really old area. However, besides looking like a 50's Americana Diner, this place is solid Asian food. We had a few dishes and were impressed with the overall quality of dishes and flavors. They were out of several things which was ind of weird as it was 4 in the afternoon, but I guess they must make it fresh. \n\nI dont think you can go wrong with anything on the menu as we ordered 5-6 things and they were all great. Love the Budah Beer Bottles! Very cool and good beer too.",149,3

"I did not enjoy my visit to Double Wide Grill.  They have a dog patio which seems like a good idea in theory.  I brought my gigantic 7 lb dog who i kept in my lap the whole time because this place was packed with dogs that people were not paying attention to.\nAlso, if you have to sit in the dog section, expect the worst dining experience of your life. You are treated like you have the plague. \nNo one cleans the tables between customers, there is garbage on the ground everywhere.  You have to eat off Styrofoam plates and use disposable cutlery.  \n\nThe icing on the cake... the waiter cannot come into the seating area so you have to go up and wait until they come back out or hope to be able to catch them as you run up there bounding over dogs.You also have to get your food when it comes out.  \n\nBUT they do not bring your food out in any particular order.  I was there with my friend and his entree came before our appetizer did. Then my dinner came out dead last after he was done eating and pretty much ready to go.\n\nThe food sounded good, but I honestly cannot say anything stood out. it was all kind of \""meh\"".\n\nI have been to many dog friendly eateries and this one may be dog friendly, but it certainly isn't people friendly. I probably won't ever come here again.",302,0
"I finally got to try this place! I know of it's rave Yelp reviews and was excited to try it when I saw it offering a certificate on restaurant.com. I put the address without the suite # and was routed to the wrong place by Maps, but the Yelp app saved the day. It's next to a gelato shop & some trashy club wear place. Very sketchy with a couple homeless people, including a man in a wheelchair offering my husband $1 for 2 cigaettes. Unfortunately, my husband had to tell him it was a vape and not a cigarette. \n\nThe restaurant itself was very clean and happy with its yellow walls. The employees were all very helpful. We ordered quite a bit of items and there were no problems accepting our certificate. We sat and the owner brought our order out to us directly. \n\nWe had:\nWood fire beef with cheese: 5 stars. This was our favorite! Very flavorful beef with stringy cheese, tomato, and lettuce. \n\nPulled pork with cheese: 4 stars. Juicy pulled pork that tasted smokey and tender. My issue with the arepas that I received was that not all the shell things were toasted equally. Some were crispy and would hold up and be buttery deliciousness. Others were more soft, but ended up becoming soggy and tasting like a mushy corn texture. \n\nReina pepiada: 4 stars. It is an avocado chicken salad. It was yummy although missing some texture.\n\nGarlic shrimp: 2 stars. This was my least favorite by far. The arepa for this one seemed very corn mealy? It wasn't toasted very much and got soggy quick. The shrimp are tiny little guys that you'd probably find at red lobster in their pasta. Also, pretty bland. \n\nGrilled chicken empanada: 2 stars. I've had empanadas made by my friends from Argentina, and it's all about the shell thing. This one was super thick! It was like eating an arepa with only a little bit of filling. Just way too carby for me. The grilled chicken in it was yummy though! I'd like to try it in an arepa next time. \n\nFried plantains: 3 stars. Not my cup of tea. Kind of slimy in texture. If they were fried in oil, I couldn't tell because there was no crisp, but because they are called fried plantains, I will assume they were doused in oil, which make it not worth the calories. \n\nGuava & cheese thing: 4 stars. Way better shell than the empanada and yummy guava with cheese. I wish the cheese was more melted but when I bit into it, it still looked like a solid block. \n\nOverall, I would stop by again if I'm in the neighborhood. Perhaps I'd ask for the arepa extra toasted just to make sure there aren't any soggy ones. I definitely want to try to the grilled chicken. I appreciate this small business and the love the put into their food. I fortunately, there were just some issues I couldn't overlook. Until next time!",668,2

You can get line passes from the casino office if you're nice and you ask the right people and move to the invited guest area instantly! The French toast was to die for and beverages are included in the 25 dollar price. You can add endless champagne for just 5 dollars more. This buffet was worth every penny.,126,4

"This is more of appreciation than an actual review.\nAs a former long time Az state employee health care was extremely frustrating. Now in retirement my medicare supplement is not an improvement. Same carrier, different plan. To find a provider, conservatively speaking, is close to impossible, due to the extremely low provider payments and the fact that the provider listings, year after year are a sad joke.Call ten places from the directory and most are not contracted or wrong address or have not been provider for years. A heart specialist was listed as under water specialist? For my needed cataract surgery I spent dozens of hours on the phone with\ncarrier who promises to call back and never does.\nVery nice and courteous and caring completely inept\npeople. After a month I gave up on my carrier and spoke to a number of offices unrelated to cataracts.\nAs usual Hatfield Family Medicine (Concentra)\nwas more than nice and caring. I left their office\nhaving an appointment at Barnet, Dulaney, Perkins\nwho are highly competent but one of possibly two firms who will accept my carrier's measly payment.\nHatfield continued to work on what they had no need to do in the first place and mailed me info on another doctor they believe will accept my plan.\nIn a few days I will finally be seen after three months of wasted time. I have to think it is generosity on the part of Barnet, Dulaney Perkins.\nA review will follow.",303,3
"While this place serves savory beef dishes, rich mashed potatoes, and creamy corn chowder,  the thing I can't get past is that not only are the side dishes equal to the size of the entree, the side is either a heaping pile of steamed vegetable that comes without sauce or seasoning, or  it's a salad that's been tainted with a cheap-o vinagrette.  If I do decide to go back to Mimi's it will only be because I'm craving meatloaf and I'm low on options.",114,1
I just don't get this place.  All the food comes straight from Cysco and falls into their fryer and onto your table.  The wings are lukewarm.  The service is bad.  The lighting is terrible.

So were the curly fries (but those are damn good anyway),97,0

"Came here looking for something sit down and a bit \""nicer\"" as we were staying at the Downtown Grand. Both the ambiance and the food was just okay to me. Service was great, we had a nice view of the pool and tank, but I found the food at Maggiano's better and probably cheaper too! \n\nWe had the prosciutto wrapped sea bass over veggies/potato - the veggies were really good. I think my husband had the mistake of of asking for his fish more well done than seared coz then the prosciutto was over done (and kinda tasted burned/fuel) and did no justice to the fish. I just had crispy risotto and meatballs. Both were good but nothing to write home about or something I couldn't make myself. \n\nThe service really makes this place stand out. With so many places to try in Vegas, I don't think I'd come back here anytime soon but it is a safe choice if you're pressed for time and are in the hotel.",212,2

"Hubby and I made the trek up from Central Phoenix today for something different for lunch. We were pleasantly surprised to find this wasn't a pretentious Scottsdale joint - the atmosphere was actually quite unassuming and welcoming. We were greeted immediately by the hostess and seated at a table near the bar, in the middle of the dining room. \n\nOur waitress seemed genuinely happy to be there, giving us a quick back-story of the restaurant (food's local, trucked in each morning, lots of gluten-free options) as she took our drink order. I'm a bit of a coffee freak, and there wasn't anything remarkable about this coffee, though it wasn't bad. I added a decent amount of (fresh) cream to my cup to cut down on the bitterness. Perhaps I'm a stickler for tradition, but I prefer my coffee in a good ol' ceramic mug, rather than the glass, handled Irish coffee mug presented. I don't think the glass keeps the coffee hot as long as ceramic - which was unfortunate, because after ordering our food, we didn't see the waitress again until after our food was delivered by another waiter. Me + lukewarm coffee = sad :(\n\nI settled on the Monte Cristo - two slices of french toast with melted gruyere, ham, and strawberry jam - with a side of roasted red potatoes. I was concerned about the saltiness of the ham overpowering the sandwich, but it was a delightfully balanced blend of savory and sweet. The maple syrup provided on the side was a perfect complement. My potatoes were also done perfectly - with sliced white onions, not too crunchy but not slimy, either. Hubby ordered the steak & eggs with two slices of gluten-free toast (from the Gluten-Free Creations Bakery in uptown Phoenix) and black beans. The waitress mentioned that all of their breakfast sides are gluten-free - it's nice to have some variety for a change. He hasn't stopped talking about his eggs all day. He ordered them over medium, and they tasted fresh and were actually cooked to his liking - no wiggly white, no chalky yolk. The seasoning in the tenderloin (roughly six ounces - all meat, mind you, no fat or bone to carve away) was seasoned perfectly to complement the eggs.\n\nBy the time our food had arrived, we decided we wanted to try the bloody mary after reading Andrea S's review below. Our waitress didn't mind at all that we wanted to \""split\"" the $8 drink and it arrived promptly. Made with cucumber vodka and stuffed to the brim with produce, this was one of the lightest and freshest bloody marys I've ever enjoyed. I've never seen pickled green beans in a bloody mary before - Hubby and I spent a good ten minutes trying to guess what they'd been marinated in (cloves? cinnamon??). The verdict - spicy and refreshing!\n\nIn short...the pros and cons:\n\nPros - \n- Delicious, local food\n- Friendly, decidedly un-Scottsdale service\n- Clean, modern, spacious bathrooms (they even have those nifty Dyson hand-dryers, ooh!)\n- Unique & varied drink menu\n- Urban, industrial decor with colorful splashes of art deco\n- Filling (!) brunch for two for $40 - not too shabby\n\nCons - \n- Coffee was meh, went cold in between touch-ups \n- Dining room was a bit crowded (I think my chair was bumped five times), and metal & concrete furnishings makes for a bit of a loud breakfast\n\nAll in all, we felt welcomed and appreciated. We'll be back!",772,3

"I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star. \n\nWe went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  \n\nThey have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.\n\nWe had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  \n\nWe had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.\n\nLastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.\n\nOverall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )",376,4

"I often visit this place to hunker down and do some work online. Its noisy, but comfortable. For a regular coffee, each size costs the same: $2.

If the DJ doesn't impress me, consider my night shot. This is probably one of the spots that I will absolutely avoid if they don't get better entertainment. On the night in question (mid May of this year), we were relaxing, drinking, and all of a sudden, the music stops, the theme to \""Rocky\"" starts playing, and they interrupt everyone's \""fun\"" to bring sparklers and a bottle of champagne to someone celebrating their birthday. On top of that, the music transitions were sub-par and on par with maybe, i don't know, a 5 year old playing with his \""My First DJ Set\""!

Perfect for a warm summer night.\n\nFavorite apps are the walnut shrimp and lollipop buffalo wings. \nFavorite entree was the Magic Mushroom Parpadelle (pasta). Really, it was a perfect combo of sauteed mushrooms, garlic, Parmigiano cheese, and truffle oil - served on a beautiful bowl of noodles.

"I'm not a vegetarian/vegan, but I try to do meat-free mondays and do veggie dishes when possible.  However I am sensitive to spice, so places that pile on heat to make up for taste are generally not going to work for me.\n\nFern started out promising - they don't carry cider or any sweet white wines that would suit the palate of a picky goof like me, but they do have some ($8!) juice blends.  (The blend tasted like 80% celery tho, not a great time).  Appetizers came out, and from the odd almond cheese, to bruschetta, to fried cauliflower, all was good.  I'd recommend the cauliflower or bruschetta to anyone, the cheese is a bit scarier.  \n\nHowever my big mistake was doing the Om Burger as my main course - with roasted tomatoes, avocado and goat cheese, sounded pretty rad.  I've done veggie burgers or garden burgers now and then, so I'm used to them being made of a mix of beans, soy, corn, whatever.  This burger...I knew on bite 1 that something was wrong.  Spiced cucumbers were on it so I removed them just in case, but with every bite came heat to the point of pain.  Knowing my own sensitivity I had my wife try a bite, since she is hispanic and more spice-friendly, but no good.  It felt like they added spice by the boatload to make up for lack of taste - not necessary when you have that much going on in a burger.  \n\nThe burger came with the finger link potatoes, which some have described as crispy or salty, but mine were bland and mostly soft.  Not much browning or crispiness.  \n\nAfter this disappointing combination, we splurged on dessert - usually I wouldn't spend more money after this type of experience, but we were with friends and they were partaking.  They had what was basically a large ring ding, with peanut butter in the middle, drizzled with chocolate all around.  This...this was a good time.  If you are in the area and need a good dessert, that alone is worth the trip.  It's still highly priced for a dessert ($8) but easily feeds 2, so not a big problem.  \n\nI might come back if in need of apps/desserts, or if feeling adventurous down the veggie/vegan path again, but otherwise not.",524,1

"I wasn't sure what rating to give Paris 66. I liked it, but I didn't love it. I guess it was, as Yelp would say, \""A-OK.\""\n\nFirst off, the decor is adorable! I mean, yeah, a French bistro that lines its walls with Art Nouveau posters is a little cliche. But being a huge fan of Art Nouveau and not going to French bistros very often, I couldn't care less. Overall, it is an unassumingly charming little place and apparently has a heated patio? Definitely a great little romantic date spot, low lighting and all! Our server was a little pretentious but nice and attentive, for the most part.\n\nMy friend got a crepe and she said it was \""pretty good\"" but nothing to rave about. I got the Moules Frites Normande. The mussels were plump, and while I liked the broth, I felt like it could've used a little more...something. It was just kind of boring and bland. No bread was given to sop up the broth, either. The fries were not very good in my opinion, and did not come with any sort of dipping sauce. I tried dipping in the broth. Still not very good, and now soggy. Basically I just wish this place was Point Brugge? Or maybe I should have ordered something else and accepted that PB is without a doubt the Moules Frites champion of Pittsburgh, and I need to stop comparing everyone else against them. I can't help it!\n\nNot knocking it off my list just yet! I need to come back to evaluate their crepes!",339,2
"My wife is a cookbook author and food critic / blogger - so we eat out at fancy restaurants at least once or twice a week, and are very critical of the places we go.  As we are always eating out and looking for another hidden gem for her to write about, we tend not to frequent any restaurant unless it is way better than average.\n\nI proposed to my wife at this restaurant almost 5 years ago, and it is incredibly rare if we are at Casa less than once or twice in a month.  The drinks are good, the wine list is acceptable (with half price bottles on Sunday and Monday), the food is SPECTACULAR, and the service is impeccable.  We have never had a bad meal here.\n\nWe have dubbed this place \""The Mob Joint,\"" as the atmosphere is very \""Old Vegas.\""  The decor is straight out of 1960's Vegas, and the brick walls are lined with pictures from the days of Frank and Sammy.  The booths and tables (lined in white linen) are dimly lit, with a romantic ambiance, and the place is just fabulous.  Their nightly entertainment is usually George, who sounds a lot like a young Frank Sinatra, and does a lot of fabulous old crooner tunes, interspersed with some comedy, some show tunes and some Billy Joel.  He is amazing.\n\nThe twice wrapped prawns that everyone here seems to be complaining about are great, wrapped in cheese and then baked in a puff pastry dough.  I think that the salty of the shrimp and cheese mixed with the slight tangy of the dough plays really, really well against the super-sweet of the caramel sauce.  (and we save the caramel sauce to drizzle over the ice cream at the end of the meal)  I like this dish quite a bit, though we don't order it every time.  What we DO order every time is their cheese garlic loaf and a side dish of Alfredo sauce for dipping.....Oh My GOD there is nothing quite so sinful.  You simply MUST try it.\n\nTheir steaks and stuffed pork chops are what we usually order, and they are beyond superb.  Their Osso Bucco is the best I've ever had.  It is so tender it literally falls from the bone.  The Vodka Shrimp is incredible as well.  Over the years, we've had most of the pasta dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed. \n\nTheir prices are on the high side, but nothing that I wouldn't expect to pay at any of the restaurants of this caliber in Vegas.  For us, with a (half price) bottle of wine, the bread loaf, an appetizer to share, side Caesar salads, our meals, and a shared ice cream treat, our bill usually runs about $125 - $150, which is what we generally spend any time we go out for a really nice dinner - and with their portions, we always have some left over for lunch the following day.\n\nMy only minor complaint about this place is that their desserts are less than spectacular, as they are currently pre-made off-site. I do love that the waitstaff are all willing to be honest about the desserts they like, and which to avoid (my wife ordered a creme brulee once, and our waiter leaned down and said with a meaningful look, \""I would really recommend the Chocolate-Peanut-Butter Bomba...The creme bruleee is, well, not what you would expect.\""). \n\nFortunately, the last time we were there the Maitre D' mentioned that they were bringing on a pastry chef in the very near future, so now the only problem will be saving ROOM for dessert!\n\nOverall, if you are looking for that perfect little hole in the wall, that will give you the true old Vegas kind of experience, Casa Di' Amore will deliver in a big way.  Oh, and if you call in advance, They even offer complimentary limo service from/to any of the hotels on The Strip!",840,3

The amount of towels, free q-tips, cotton balls, and other regular free items supplied were nice. However, there was not a coffee machine. The view was great, however there was some construction going on (earbuds were provided for daytime sleepers.) For some reason though, we were given a hotel room right next door to a couple with three small kids who were screaming all night and morning. This put the kabosh on our relaxing stay. Our fault for not letting mgmnt know but we kept thinking the kids would stop screaming soon. When we checked out we did not have cash for the valet tip, and their ATM was not up yet (should be up and running later that day), so we took the complimentary bikes to an ATM (awesome!). So mixed experience, however the staff was amazing and is the reason why we would consider this hotel a 2nd time.",238,2
"1. Fries in a mini shopping cart(strange but cool concept)\n2. sushi and burgers(it used to be no sushi, but now i love this concept, you could eat sushi and burgers, my favorite foods in one place.\n3. happy hour(awesome deals, food and drinks0\n4. open till like 2 am, when all other restaurants are closed Delux is still open)\n5. BEST BURGER IN ALL ARIZONA, and probably one of the best i had anywhere outside arizona. theres a reason this burger keeps winning best burger in az. their Delux Burger is just delicious. The meat is melt in your mouth(make sure to order medium rare, otherwise you cant get the full benefits) two people can eat from one, and im a 6'1 guy so i could have enough with half. I would choose sweet potatoe over regular fries. \n\n*****Once you try this burger you wont be able to enjoy others, as you will always compare it to this(just keep in mind, theres fast food, pub burgers and then there's Gourmet Burgers, Delux being gourmet; you cant put others in the same line. \n\nAVG burger price: $11\nfries: $5 or $6",264,4
Likely your best bet for breakfast in this general area for now - which means there is an opportunity here for a locally owned breakfast spot. Lots of small inexpensive spaces for lease in the plaza right next door.,42,2
"Fantastic food!! Amazingly attentive service!! Coffee was hot and fresh, not too acidic and definitely not weak. I had biscuits and gravy, the wife had an omelette. The kids are a Mickey Mouse pancake and Belgian waffles with chocolate chips. An excellent breakfast for all. Big smiles all around.",60,4
We went there and had a drink and some wings. We are from the East coast and have been to the place that has the original wings. They were okay but the chicken is pressed and seemed very chicken nugget for the boneless and the sauce wasn't that great on the regular bone in traditional. Maybe we are just picky. We wanted to try their pizza but the ppl behind us complained the dough wasn't cooked. We aren't sure if we want to go back or not,99,1
So sick I got the chorizo plate with rice and beans and now I feel sick. Never going back..... ugh,23,0
"The food is good here, but nothing ruins a restaurant like bad customer service. I had a Groupon deal and they lied to me and said it was only worth half its value, because it was towards the end the month. It is never ok to cheat your customers.",56,0
"The Spice Market buffet was fine at Planet Hollywood. There a lot of variety for most people, but as someone who's vegetarian and also doesn't eat pasta, the options were a bit more limited. Honestly, there was still plenty / tons of stuff to eat. I know I left the place over-stuffed.\n\nWe had bought a voucher for this place from one of those discount show ticket booths. They said lunch would be $14.99 instead of some other higher price and the voucher itself costed $2 each. One thing that was annoying was when we did go for lunch they said it was holiday pricing due to the Memorial Day weekend, and we had to pay like an extra $7 or so per person. We had already waited in like for like 15-20 minutes, so were like, what the hey.\n\nThe best section of the buffet was the Mediterranean food. By far. Not even close. All the entrees were really delicious. That happened to be my first stop and it definitely set the bar really high for the rest of the stations. Unfortunately, none of the others panned out in the same way. Nonetheless, even trying all the options got me stuffed.\n\nIt was so funny, the group I was with was super excited and hungry when we got there. They're all like, we're going to chill and fulfill for the next 2 hours. It was funny, that only like 30 minutes in, we were all more than done. That's how these places operate, I guess. Just like tables, you can't win against Vegas...",340,2
"We stayed here a few years back while attending a conference and it was one of the worst hotel experiences ever.  We reserved a non smoking room with a king bed.  Checked in went up the stupid and slow \""inclinator\""  which had a huge line due to its slowness because of the angle it goes up at.  Hay engineering geniuses how about putting the real elevators in the middle so you won't have to go up at a 12 degree angle.  We get to our room and it has 2 full beds and stinks.  My wife was pregnant at the time so this didn't work. \n\n Back to the front desk where they explain they can't guarantee the room you book, now thats customer service for you!  They were kind enough to find us a room in the tower with a king bed which is fine with us as you even get to use a big boy elevator that goes up and down.  The room looked fine.  That night though we find out that the mattress is horrible and you can feel the springs poking into your back.  To top it off we get the stupid f-ing ass hole inconsiderate drunk stupid f-ing frat boys that come in at 1 in the morning hooting and yelling.  Why in the hell do hotels make the walls that thin, especially in Vegas? I was glad to get out of that shit hole",291,0
"ive tried this place 3 times now, giving it the benefit of the doubt.. all terrible.  to say the least all the bartenders were really nice.  I went in for food each of the 3 times. the food was terrible each time.  im not hard to please either.  i know they changed their menu and i read on here that the burgers were really good.  ok ill give it one more try. the burger took 30 min to cook, and im 1 of the 3 people in the bar.  i asked for medium it was cooked to death.  and the potato fries were extra crispy.  the food was so greasy and disgusting.  i tried to salvage it and pick all the nasty toppings off and just eat the burger. it was so greasy i just threw it out , i felt so bad after having just a few bites.  and it was $12 bucks. i should of just went to in and out seriously! so gross.",205,1
"Last night after Blue man Group. We wanted to try 800 degrees.  We ordered 3 pizzas, each one was a menu item pizza with one ingredient added on. Not too hard to mess that up. It was not busy only three group in front of us. Took way too long, 15 minutes until they called our number.  Then the add on ingredients were not no the pizzas. They remade them and they  came out wrong again. So they made them for the third time. Came out right.  Now the pizzas crust was cooked perfect but the customer under the center was raw. Too much water on top of the pizza. Bad customer service.  Not coming back.",145,0
I can't wait to try everything on this menu.  We got smothered burritos that are massive and you have a choice of red mild or hot and green mild.  The red hot is great.  We had a colifornia and a regular carne adasa - the meat was tender and flavorful.  The only other thing we got was a fish taco to try it - it was also huge and so delicious - with a lot of fresh guac on top.  They have a huge selection and I really hope they do well - the food speaks for it's self.,120,4
"This is a fairly small restaurant but the decor is nice and the service is friendly.\n\nTheir chicken tikka massala is very good, with a great tandoori flavor on the chunks of chicken.  They have a lot of traditional items on the menu as well, not just westernized dishes.\n\nWhen I get a craving for Indian, this is the place I go.",82,4
Loved the trainers but unfortunately I had to move and they made me pay 25% of my remaining contract to get out of it.  If I were just being lazy and not going that would be one thing but I'm moving out of state and feel penalized.  Nothing personal against the gym but this contract thing is ridiculous!!!,69,1

"I went in to check this place out, as i'm always looking for new vape shops or places to either look up their products, and see how their service is.\n\nThis place is quite new as I write this, and there are many plans for this place in the future, like a lounging room, more products, and etc.\n\nSo far there isn't much to look at, their products are good, the liquid they carry are from Pink Spot Vapors, which i don't have anything against, service is very friendly, Once i walked in, i was immediately greeted and asked how i could be helped. I definitely like that. There's some good plans for this place and hope the owners can make their goal come true.\n\nGoing to definitely come back and refer some of my friends that want to get into vaping.",179,3
"I loved the food here. I tried out the 4 course tasting menu with a group of friends a while back. The only thing i didn't like was the service. We had to wait at the bar area for more than 20 minutes although we had reservations and even after we were seated, had to wait some more for our waitress. Everything was extremely slow that night and the 4 courses felt like it took forever. \n\nMy first course of the night was the truffled onion soup with duck. It was simply delicious and extremely savory.\n\nSecond came the chorizo wrapped sea bass. The flavors worked well together for another tasty dish. \n\nThird was the filet mignon. I opted to add the black truffle and foie gras with the filet for the additional fee but felt that it was totally worth it. The only thing is that the dish starts to become too overwhelming and heavy especially seeing as everything i've had before this has been heavy as well. Butttttttt it was almost THE BEST filet i've had. It completely melted in my mouth and was cooked to perfection.\n\nBy the time dessert came around with the chocolate souffle, i was stuffed beyond imagination but still had room for a couple bites. ;) \n\nall in all a great experience, i would have given them 4 stars if not for the service. :)",283,2
"This is a great local place to get anything done.\nI was really nervous about going blonde because I'm a natural brunette and my hair is picky. But Hayley put me at ease and assured me it would look great, and it did! The atmosphere is amazing, and everyone is so nice. My friend and I were offered free muffins and drinks and felt completely comfortable. They even own a cafe and botique next door! This place is awesome, and worth every penny.",98,4
"To those of us recent and longtime sufferers of either wheat allergy or celiac disease this place is a godsend. Their breads, bagels and donuts are way beyond anything I've been able to get at either whole foods or sprouts. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted they have several sandwiches they can make for you and every one I've had is good. By far my favorite is the philly cheese steak.\n\nAdditionally the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the decor of the bakery is bright and cheery. I cannot recommend this place enough!",117,4
"We stop by every time we go to the movies always great service and the \""Me Drink\"" is on there special board either hot or cold depending on the season is always our favorite. The cupcakes are delicious as well!! Keep ip the great work.",51,4
"Just ok.  Meat wasn`t juicy, and I found I was adding a lot of mustard while eating it.  The bread with the `sandwich` seemed superflous since it was too small to contain any meat inside it anyways.\n\nAlso, I think I just paid $1.75 plus tax for a large pickle.",72,2

"Stopped by after work today. Ordered steak kabob and hummus and baba ganoush. The girl who took my order (I phoned in) was pleasant and understood me perfectly, as I her.  When I left a $2 tip in the tip jar, she proceeded to tell me those tips are going to the boss. I found that odd and asked why the tips weren't split among the employees and she just smiled and said that's the way it is. I was going to take the $2 out and give it to her. Looks like greed just finds it's way... Anyway, the food was decent. Steak tender with great flavor; rice was colorful, light , and flavorful; baba ganoush DAMN GOOD! The hummus could be a little creamier, but has a nice amount of oil to keep it smooth. Also has a nice roasted, smoky flavor and a little darker than regular hummus. Sliced olives on top a nice touch. 3 stars until I try more food.",204,2
"Cowboy burger and sweet potato fries tasty, but not really outstanding. Service somewhat slow. Too much noise. \n\nPrices rather ridiculous. Burger $12. Fries $5. Soft drink $3.50. Over $25 with tip. All food in Mirage way over-priced.",63,2
"My wife is a big fan of 99 cent stores. Me, not so much. But I get dragged along once in awhile. I do think they need to change the name of the store to the 9999 cent store as everything is now 99.99 cents. Or at least that's what they say, but when it rings up in shows as $1. So you're getting ripped off .0001 cent on every item. \n\nThe other day I actually suggested going to this store, because I needed helium balloons. I saw a sign that said they were 99.99 cents. But when the lady rang it up, it came up as $1.50. I told her the sign said 99 cents. She explained that I had to pay for the helium too! I have never heard of having to pay extra for helium. But whatever, it was still pretty cheap. And even better, I got a big gift bag for 99 cents. I hate wrapping and this was a cheap alternative. Still not a huge fan, but I think this will be my new spot to buy gift bags.",245,2
"I like this place best when no one else is there to talk to except the staff and a couple of locals.  On the weekends, this place is crazy busy but all other time's Spin provides a relaxing atmosphere where sophisticated locals have a drink while carrying on discussions about various topics.

"Moved from Pittsburgh to Richmond, VA.\n\nWhen they came and visually inspected the place, they gave me a quote that was cheaper than what I got on the phone! That saved me a few bucks. A big reason why I went with \""Two Men\"" is because I was moving out of town and most other companies put your stuff along side other people's stuff. And they wanted to load a few days before my actual move-in date. Which meant that I would have to stay in a hotel for a few days! No thanks. Two Men moved my stuff on Wednesday morning and unloaded early on Thursday morning. The guys move fast and they were really professional. \n\nI recommend Shane and Shawn. \n\nYou don't have to tip. But I sure did because they did such a thorough and clean job. Thanks guys.",177,4

"Finally got to stay at The Cosmopolitan and was very excited about it! I definitely have lots to say so I'll just keep it simple by talking about the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous, modern hotel with great rooms.\n- Large balconies and it's especially great for smokers and enjoying a cigar and drink on the balcony after a long night.\n- Kitchenette with a good sized fridge and freezer. Things actually freeze if you put it in the freezer!\n- Friendly staff.\n- Marquee is right downstairs.\n- Comfortable beds and pillows.\n\nCons: \n- Food options aren't that great. We were disappointed with all our meals.\n- Lighting in room is dark so trying to put on makeup somewhere besides the bathroom makes it almost impossible.\n- Awkward window in between bathroom/bedroom and only a thin curtain to divide it. (I don't know if this applies to all the rooms, but it was definitely weird for us.)\n- Complimentary check out is only until 12pm. In order to stay until 3pm, we had to pay over $100.\n- $15 for 24 hours of wi-fi.",256,3
"Discount Tire is the ONLY place to purchase and service tires. Could you save ten bucks at Costco? Maybe- but you will not beat the service at Discount Tire. SInce I got my first cars years and years ago, I knew to go to Discount, since that is where my family took our cars.\n\nI went to this location to have my tires rotated. Something I learned a few years ago is that you can call and make appointments at Discount Tire, so I called the day before and made an appointment- which speeds things up and gets you out faster.\n\nThis location was recently remodeled and it looks great. Comfy soft chairs, bottled water and candy to snack on, it's very nice. As with the other employees, they are amazing and work SO hard. Discount Tire has a customer for life, and I really appreciate the great customer service, especially when I am receiving a free tire rotation.\n\nWell done Discount Tire, you're doing it right.",206,4
"I went there yesterday. Quite an Excellent burger but would I pay that much again and again? Maybe, as of now I'm not decided. The only attraction I have it the most expensive Item on the menu, a 39$ burger with black truffles, kobe beef, I guess I didn't like the buns that much. It felt like it wasn't fresh enough or simply because it was dry. I took the Trider trio or whatever the name is. It's 3 mini burger, I remember A&W had a mini burger promo and they were better. not the meat of course but the overall a fast food chain was able to convince more than that burger. I guess it's the frustration or paying 20$ (23 with tip) for good burger (not excellent) I kind of felt a little bit of bitterness regarding the price. It reminds me of clubbing in the States where Dress code is usually not required, but you'll quickly see a difference between the poor people's club and rich kid one based on the Entry Fee that's large. MBRGR has the same  feeling to it: you're paying a lot for the really cute waitress, the trendy looks and the long Designed bar. \n\nJe suis all\u00e9 au M:Brgr hier soir apr\u00e8s la job, question de me remplir le bide de malbouffe snobinarde. A 20$ (23) J'ai pris le trio slider qui consiste a 3 mini burger. C'\u00e9tait bon mais pas eXcellent! J'ai pas hais \u00e7a mais j'n'ai pas ador\u00e9 \u00e7a au point de vouloir retourner. Je crois que la seule chose qui me ferait retourner l\u00e0 c'est les serveuses (vraiment hot) et le burger au boeuf kobe avec de la truffe noire (39$) le burger. C'est pas que je sois si gourmand mais me semble que 3 mini burger c'\u00e9tait pas assez. J'aurais aim\u00e9 10 oz (plutot que trois X 2.5 oz de viande). Le bun \u00e9tait semi-sec, bref j'avais une  mini amertume du prix que j'avais pay\u00e9 pour manger la. Comme disait Charles plus bas, c'est une place o\u00f9 je me verrais plus boire comme un trou, mais c'est tellement trendy que l'ambiance c'est juste pas moi. Mais je pense que si tu veux sortir avec une petite poulette sympathique, que tu veux y aller safe, pas trop complexe, par trop pr\u00e9tentieux mais avec de la classe et un petit c\u00f4t\u00e9 trendy qui \u00e9pate plus que le Buffet Fu Lam ou le Paccini ben t'as un bon choix chez M:BRGR",664,2
"I gave this restaurant 1 star because at least the service was good, but the food was horrible. First we got the escargot as an appetizer. Parts of the escargot was cold and tasted like dirt. It was obviously frozen and not cleaned well. Just to let you know this is not our first time eating escargot, it's one of our favorite dishes, so we've had it plenty of times. As for the entrees we got the swordfish, which was extremely dry and tasteless. We also got the seabass, which was over cooked and the filet steak which was over chard. It was very disgusting! Very disappointed in the food.  How can we tell our server that all of the food that came out was disgusting. We didn't want to make a scene so we just ate what we could, paid and left. Our first and last time ever going there. The price that you pay for the food, it was definitely not worth it. We've had 100 times better. Mastro definitely topped the list for the worst expensive restaurant in Vegas. Definitely will not be returning. Great service but horrible food. Don't waste your time and money.",247,0

"We had a Groupon for this spot and decided to give it a try since we love Greek food and it's not too far from our place. When we walked in we were greeted pretty quickly and asked to sit outside, even though it was a bit warm at the time, they had a great deal of misters. \n\nWe started with the traditional hummus, which was honestly the best part of the whole meal.  If we go back I'll probably just have this as a meal! We also had the Lamb Souvlaki - which was tasty, but the meat was just a bit tough.  The drinks we had were made well by the bartender.\n\nThe service was done well, but was definitely on the slow side, which may have been due to us sitting outside when there was only one other group out there also.\n\nOverall: B\nVery \""A-OK\"" place to go if you like hummus and drinks! We will probably wait on another Groupon if we go again.",213,2
Big fan of build your own burger.\n\nI feel this place gets lost in the shuffle of the Plaza Midwood area. It really shouldn't because their food and beer selection is really good. \n\nLike I opened with their build your own burger section is my favorite part of the menu. I'm constantly on and off a strict diet and that part of the menu caters to my needs. And when I'm off my diet the sweet tots are a must.\n\nThey always have a couple dozen craft beers on tap. Mostly local. Yay!\n\nMy girlfriend and I go about every Sunday and just about every time we are there the manager stops by to check on us. Which is a very nice personal touch that keeps us coming back.,161,4
"Disorganized. Disgusting. But friendly, and the price is right.  \n\nSeveral open tables, yet still a 20 minute wait.  Almost as many staff as customers, yet you have to physically grab one of them to get some attention.\n\nMy bananas foster french toast had maybe 10 paper thin slivers of bananas and was swimming in caramel sauce to the point it filled my plate.  It was disgusting.  I kid you not - I literally washed the caramel sauce off my french toast with maple syrup to lighten things up.  Their coffee is just nasty; reminiscent of my grandma's and bad even loaded with cream and sugar.\n\nStaff are some of the nicest people you'd want to be around, unless you're relying on them to serve you breakfast.  Prices are probably the best in North Scotts. for breakfast.\n\nYes, I'd go back.  It's possible they're still settling into the new location, and they seem to have the right attitude to eventually get things running smoothly.",224,1

"Overview:\nThe Omni William Penn Hotel is a 3 to 4 star hotel in the heart of the Pittsburgh downtown with a decent sized bedroom and good cleanliness, but poor heating, a poor room design, and a cramped bathroom without a tub, and about average pricing for its class.\n\nThe Room:\nStandard king sized bed with a nightstand with an electrical outlet built into the base of the lamp (something every hotel should have). I did not find the bed to be particularly comfortable but one confounding factor was that the heat did not work in the room which caused me to wake up several times in the middle of the night. I visited in December and the vents only blew cold air for some odd reason, and yes, I even tried pumping the \""target\"" temperature to 73F. The desk has two electrical outlets built into its base and is a great size for working. Unfortunately, the WiFi is NOT free unless you're a special member. The television is relatively small, positioned quite far away from the bed, and at an odd angle from the desk, so I didn't actually use it much. The signal didn't appear to be high definition or the television was configured poorly.\n\nThe Bathroom:\nExcellent soaps/shampoos, BUT the bathroom itself was extremely small. I had very little room to put my toiletries like my contacts, tooth brush, various hair products, etc and was basically right up against the towel rack when sitting on the toilet. It was far from ideal. There is a large shower but no bathtub.\n\nThe Location:\nMy particular room did not have a view of anything but the giant building next to me, but I thought the location was very good. When you check in, you are given a nice little map of the museum and touristy things to do within walking distance.\n\nConclusions:\nThe Omni William Penn in downtown Pittsburgh is in a great location for experiencing downtown Pittsburgh, and is very close to the 28X bus from the airport, but the poor room design and lack of heating are significant enough drawbacks that will keep me from coming back again.",440,1
"A friend and I went to Sunday brunch at Six Penn Kitchen and I was very dissapointed. I ordered the corned beef hash skillet with over easy eggs and whole grain mustard hollaindaise. I never got anything whole grain mustard hollaindaise. It makes me mad that I didn't realize this until we were on our way out the door. And my friend ordered eggs benedict which was supposed to come with ham and spinach- never got any ham or spinach. We got ripped off.\nAnyway,back to the hash skillet. The skillet was taken directly out of a volcano oven. I tried stirring it and blowing on it- but it was so hot I could not eat anything for  15 minutes. And this is mid July. Not exactly a good menu item for the season. There was very little egg or corned beef. It was almost entirely potatoes. \nLastly, our waiter was not very enthusiastic about working there. I just don't think it is right to go from table to table saying how big of a drag it is to be stuck working Sunday morning.",224,1
"FRIED PICKLES FRIED PICKLES FRIED PICKLES...get it?! Love their fried pickles. Its truly about the only reason I ever go, is when I can't fight the urge of holding back from those fried pickles.

But its the place to go on the mountain for those damn pickles.",89,2
"I've been here a few times. I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere is nice especially for a date night. However, the food is not that good. The meat is often overcooked.

"*******REVIEW UPDATE*********\n\nThe Owner of WildFlower wrote me a very kind e-mail expressing concern over my bad experience. We had a couple of very kind exchanges and a very pleasant phone call.\n\nI am excited to come back and give Wildflower another go.And no, I am not accepting free food. Louis offered to make a charitable donation to a breast cancer charity in my friend's name instead. \n\nI am upping this two stars automatically. I'll happily give it another shot. On my own dime. Another review to follow.\n*************************************\n\nIt's fairly uncommon for me to write a 1 or 2 star review, because I am a generally positive person when it comes to my Yelp finds. \n\nThis morning, I woke up after a fantastic night, and I figured, why not try Wildflower. It seemed to be an Arizona institution and had some great reviews on Yelp. Why not?\n\nI walked in, and everything seemed like it was on par. Clean establishment. Plenty of small booths, with power outlets, free wi-fi, the whole nine-yards.\n\nThis morning, I ordered a \""Sausage and Egg Breakfast Sandwich\"" which is: \""scrambled eggs, sausage, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar and cilantro on a buttered Ciabatta Roll.\""\n\nI sat down and waited. And waited. I was starving, but like a true English gentleman, I waited patiently some more. Finally, 14 minutes later, as I was about to get up and say something, my food arrived.\n\nNow, on the menu, the sandwich sounded good, but it just didn't work in the execution phase. The Ciabatta was mushy, and gooey. Rather gross. The eggs were overcooked, and dry, and everything just seemed very....inedible. My fantastic morning quickly turned miserable because of this horrid sandwich.\n\nI don't see myself ever coming back here after this experience, especially since there are so many other breakfast options in the area. I'd much rather drive down the street and brave traffic and parking issues in Old Town and grab something from the Sandwich Club...and get something far superior.",477,2

Altogether a great addition to Goodyear!",80,3
"The service was friendly, but she was new. The complimentary hushpuppies were cold and hard as a rock. The sweet tea was good as was the mac & cheese.

"After dining at Beaver Choice tonite,  I decided to read a few reviews before writing mine.  Incredible how many people experienced lengthy waits for their food.  We waited well over an hour for our entrees.  The owner explained that two chefs called out sick from out of town (apparently enjoying the holidays) but that wouldn't explain the other reviewers who had similar experiences the other eleven months of the year.  The food was all good.  My wife and I both had the Jager schnitzel.  The sides, especially the beets with horseradish were very good as well.  One reviewer who ate there a month ago said they were out of Polish potato dumplings.   Well, they're still out of them.  The wine list is small, inexpensive and unimpressive.   There are no beers on draft.  The best part was after we left and I discovered I left my VISA there.  I returned only ten minutes later and the owner didn't seem to remember me.  Then she suggested that a lot of people \""think\"" they forgot to take their card, implying that maybe I left it somewhere else.  To make a long story short, it was still in the waitress' pocket.  The owner doesn't know how to run a restaurant and we won't be back.  If I want a great schnitzel, we'll just have to return to Germany or Austria; they know how to cook and serve.",300,1
Had a difficult experience. The rooms were far from the lobby. Th design was shaped like a maze which required a map just to get to the lobby. It rained and there were one inch puddles in the walkway outside my door.  The staff was pleasant and tried to serve but often promised service that was not timely or never happened. Shuttles promised for transportation were often very late or full.  The bar offered food that was tasty. Two of the bellmen were excellent and sheltered us from the rain with umbrellas and a golf cart. Others tried but were exceedingly busy to offer promo service. Overall it was an effort just to survive this experience. Had I known I would have rented a car just to get to the lobby and to get to nearby areas without waiting.,155,0
"For a clean, well-measured, classy man's haircut that makes you feel fresh and cool --- get Jonny as your barber.  Sit in the chair with some warm shaving cream and a cold beer while people around you are getting inked.  Leave happy.\n\nYour haircut is Jonny's art and science, and he'll groom you up perfectly at a totally reasonable price.  Here's someone who takes his work seriously and does it with pride.  You can tell Jonny cares that your neckline, sides and top will fit your head well; and you can trust him too.  This is his passion, and you want someone like that taking care of your hair.\n\nThe atmosphere here is great, extremely artistic and professional, but also incredibly down-to-earth.  Relax with a beer while you get your haircut and come back to get a free edge clean-up inbetween visits back.  Great service.",194,4

Everyone needs a sandwich.\n\nInfused into the gas station this business has a nice little thing going. I've had quite a few sandwich from here after filling up on gas. Each time the staff have been pleasant and respectful.\n\nI will say that few times I've called ahead for sandwiches they have been dry or cold. But on the whole the Philly steak sandwiches are great. I'll always be repeat here,91,2
"Don't go here!!!!  This is the worst mattress store out there.  We bought 3 complete mattress sets and was going to buy more for our rental when our sets started to cave in,  we told them of problems and they were like 'What do you want us to do' they lie about lifetime warranty/exchange.. All this w/in 6mos.we paid over 2000. For them.. They are nothing but scammers & bullsh*t... Buyer beware! If it seems too good to be true it probably is...Stay away nothing but Liars & scammed!!!",125,0
These guys are the definition of customer service. The first time that I went to Autozone was when I noticed that my car was acting up after a car wash from across the street. I quickly determined that I was out of coolant. I looked up and noticed Autozone directly across the street. I went and purchased a 50/50 mix of coolant and water. They even double checked to make sure I bought the correct coolant.\n\nA couple of days ago I went to replace a headlight bulb that went out and the guy at the counter warned me not to touch the bulb in a certain way because that would drastically cut down on the bulb's life. I would have definitely touched the bulb in the wrong spot if I wasn't warned ahead of time.\n\nI always see these guys helping people install stuff on their cars all the time. They are truly a class act.,184,4
"My review is not based solely from the food but the whole experience of the restaurant, starting from the wait. This restaurant, although I don't know if a place this small should even be called a restaurant, has a LONG WAIT. By long I mean a few hours maybe. Do not be deceived by the seemingly short line. Since there are only a handful seats, it takes forever for your turn to come around. \nWhile waiting, you are going to suffer from the smoke and dirty carpets. I felt almost itchy and disgusted waiting in line since the restaurant is placed right in the middle of a casino floor. There isn't even a proper door or sectional to divide the restaurant from the casino. I started having headache from breathing in the pungent air for such a long time. \nAs for the food, yes they are good because there is a ton of seafood in there. But I didn't feel like it was special to the extent that you would wait hours for this in such a terrible environment. The portions are huge, so definitely share it with someone. There is no way you could even finish half of the food by yourself. \nThe service of the restaurant is pretty bad. There is a \""chef\"" who cooks and there is a server/chef who does everything from cleaning the tables, cooking the food at times, serving the drinks and food, bringing you the check. So evidently, this person is super busy. You have to wait for him to come close to you to ask for more drink or even your check. Also, while we were eating the chef got frustrated and said things to the \""server\"". This just made everything super uncomfortable for me because it is a complete open kitchen. \n\nVegas has so many great restaurants. DO NOT COME HERE AFTER LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DURING YOUR TRIP. \nMaybe, if you have a ton of time and want to have a lot of seafood for the cheap price and live in Vegas or something, then I guess this restaurant could be good for you. \n\nI WOULD NEVER RETURN HERE EVER AGAIN. \nDISGUSTING AIR CONDITIONS.",442,0
"Well,  we went there on a night out on the town.  I was really excited to take my man here since he loves gaming and drinking!  Perfect Combo Right?   WRONG! \n\nWhen we walked in, first thing we noticed is the tables, with bottle pricing, you normally see in a CLUB!  Outragious!  But, hey lets give it a shot.  It had a nice setting to it all, and all old school games.  When we went to order a drink, they wanted too much for a simple JACK and COKE!  I told the bartender that I was a local and that is too much, but thank you.  She was very rude and gave me lip.\n\nWe left just as quickly as we came.  Thanx to that chick I will never be back here.  I'll just go across the street to the Griffin for drinks half Price and nicer people.\n\nI must give props to the Bouncer at the door, he is the BEST thing about this place, if I was him I'd find some nicer people to work with!",233,0
I met some friends here and I love the concept behind this place. We had a larger party so there was a bit of a wait for a table. The server was fairly attentive but he was very infrequent in how often he came to our table. I don't know if this is typical of brunch place but the server didn't even come take our drink order for at least 10 minutes. It took another 10 minutes to get my drink (which was a coke). Then we waited for another 15 minutes for the server to come back to take our orders. The food took forever to come and it was slightly disappointing. My boyfriend got the biscuit and gravy (which he eats everywhere) and he said it was the worst meal at a resturant he has ever had. The french fries were really good and the seasonal fruit was top notch. Make sure you have a lot of time on your hands before going.,190,1
"We stopped in here Saturday night about 10 PM.  We were lucky to get one of the back tables by the bar that had leather couch seating.\n\nThe dark, sexy atmosphere is great.  Khani Cole and her band always put on a nice performance.\n\nI tried the tiramisu and it was very good.\n\nIt's nice to have a place like this relatively close to home.",90,3
"I originally thought this was some kind of furniture store. So I walked in surprised that I was completely wrong. Al though there was furniture there was much more then that. After relaxing what it was a young lady popped from the corner with a warm welcome. See if I brought my wife with me she would have felt at ease. Vanity was the employee who helped me out she was also with another associate who I can't remember her name. But she was blonde with some cool ear rings. Vanity helped me out more because she made me feel comfortable and not feel you know dirty.\n\nI told her what I wanted and what my wife wanted and gave her my price range. I probably took an hour there spent some good money. The service was amazing and she also recommended a jazz motion. Since original I wanted furniture I had to get something and my wife loved it so that's a win win for me. Everything else I got was at my price range and the product was better then anything I would have guessed to pick out. She was awesome.\n\nThe store in general was clean good looking and I can see where it's mainly for couples or women. There's no corner in the side that some places have like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and the adult super store. I like the environment I did not feel like I was in a dirty place.\n\nVery good job with the store lay out and staff. This has changed my mind about \""adult store\"" I was in a couples store. Keep up the great work!",327,4
I went for restaurant week priced fixed dinner with wine pairing. After passing the wine tower numerous times I had to finally eat here. \n\nThe service was attentive without being over the top. The beef short and shallots were good but I was expecting a bit more from a wasabi pomme puree. \n\nIt is a fun place to dine at because of the wine tower and the wine selection being on Ipads.,88,3
I can't believe a place this delicious actually exists. Everything I ate and drank here resulted in pure euphoria. I'll be back.,30,4
"We called for delivery and were told that they couldn't deliver because the delivery guys truck was broke down. We really wanted to try this place out so we went ahead and drove over to pick up. We were told the pizza would be ready in about 25 mins. We got there 30 mins after calling. When we tried to pay the CC machine wasnt working and we had to pay cash. Again, not a huge deal- just another inconvenience. We then waited at least another 15 mins for our pizza to be ready. \n\nWith all that said, the pizza was AMAZINGLY good. Wings were mediocre- could have been crispier- but the pizza---- seriously awesome.  We got the meatlovers and a pepperoni/sausage/mushroom...both larges. They were huge and fed our family of 6 with pizza left over. The entire family loved the pizza. \n\nPlease fix your customer service issues. We will give you a pass on them and try again simply because the food was so great. But if the customer service stuff doesnt get better we wont keep coming back.",230,2
"you know what....i was scared to stay at this hotel after reading all these reviews and watching youtube videos of the hotel.....but actually...it really wasn't that bad at all... I mean it was very cheap...right in the middle of the strip....the rooms were clean, room service was very friendly...i had no big issues...now of course this is not as nice as other hotels as i stayed at like treasure island, flamingo or ph....the furniture is a bit outdated and the view was not that great...but honestly...if your main concern about vegas is the room then soemthing is wrong you...if you're going to vegas to stay in the room..then YOU are the problem ;P....but ya the hotel was just fine...would i stay here again? ehhh wont be my first choice but i guess i wouldnt mind it.....STOP COMPLAINING PEOPLE....just get drunk and enjoy VEGAS",190,3
Pretty ok rooms were very nice. Fast elevators spacious parking garage or get your car valet for no extra. They just need to do a better job with there confirmations they messed up  my grandmothers room reservations so she had to bunk with someone else they admitted they made the mistake but couldn't do anything for her do to the hotel was full sucks. Then they messed up on all of our free breakfast deals smh n e who. Word to the wise confirm if your going here confirm confined confirm make sure you get peoples names you talk to on the phone and then call back at a diffrent time and talk to someone else and ask them about the details of your reservation. It shouldn't be this hard but its whatever now but I will definitely research more hotels before coming back.,158,1
"I can't fault this place, the burgers were to die for, especially the \""BLT\"". Go with the fat fries, they are far nicer than the standard ones. The only thing I wished I'd tried were the milkshakes which looked divine. The service was exceptional and the only thing that was variable on a number of visits was the speed at which the food arrived. I guess that's only to be expected at busy times.\n\nI have no trouble in recommending this venue.",106,3
"First off, this isn't exactly the kind of place I'd eat normally. I have no problem spending money on good food, but this place is just a mess. I only visited here, because it was being paid for by someone's work. So the price was no object, and it still didn't stack up! I've eaten a fair amount of sushi in my life. Theirs was nearly some of the worst I've ever had, period. It was just pitiful. The rolls were tiny and mostly rice. Moving along, we tried their skewered shrimp. Also disappointing. How do you screw up shrimp? Arg! I had a few cocktails, they were pretty heavy with the booze, which is nice. Service was pitiful too. They seemed almost annoyed with us trying to sample multiple things. It's gotta be a pretty bad place, when you eat on someone else's dollar and have nothing good to say about it. Keep moving folks, nothing to see here.",206,1

"Daphne Cafe is another restaurant I always forget about until I walk past it on Ellsworth - and this place is worth remembering bc they've got lots of outdoor seating which is at a premium in Shadyside in the summer!\n\nThe first few times I came here the food was good but the service was kind of meh.  The food has improved, and so has the service!  I think they just needed to work the kinks out.\n\nLet me tell you something:  there's little I wont do for hummus, and they've got great hummus here.  Everything tastes fresh and is inexpensive.  It's not a fancy restaurant, but its a nice restaurant and the past two times I've been here everything has been great.  \n\nIf you havent tried this restaurant I suggest you do so now, bc its been increasingly crowded with each return, I think word is getting out.",192,3
"Off the hook!!  so much fun!  we made a couple connections to bypass the line and get us through and after we had our pic taken on the red carpet on the way in i had a good feeling.  Club is very nicely done, layed out well...bars upstairs and down. I think they could move the vip area on the dance floor and have a bigger dance area but that would probably be my only critique.  Drinks are good and the DJ was AWESOME!  he kept playing one great song after the other and the crowd was really going.  My only complaint and I guess it's not about the club, I know the bouncers are just doing their jobs.  When stupid loser guys who flop down a grip of money to look cool in the vip area, don't have the bouncers grab cute girls from the crowd only to talk to them like crap and then try to discard them when you're done with them!  some frigging ass hat thought that would be a good idea...screw him!!  \nsorry for the rant!  \nGood music..lots of hot guys...good drinks...viva las vegas!!!  We will be back!",245,4
"Had a chance to try El Pulgarcito for a Yelp UYE (thanks Seth for the setup). A great Salvadorian restaurant on Central. Service is great, then menu is extensive and authentic. I think I tried everything. The place was suppose to be inexpensive, but I guess I order for 4 (pupusas, tacos, plantains, etc)...ha. I wanted to try a little of everything, but the normal size orders came out. You can make an event of the place by just sticking to the apps/small plates side of the menu, or if you're familiar with the place, extend yourself to the other pages. A really good place to go with a $10 in your packet!",147,3
"I've been to Panera so many times, all my experiences have just blended together to create one big memory blob. I will base my review of this Panera from that memory blob.\n\nI walk through a set of double doors. I stroll past several couples dining of their sandwiches and salads, and a handful of solo coffee drinkers wearing their headphones and glaring at their laptop screens. I stop close enough from the cashiers to let them know that I am, indeed, a customer, but not too close to give them the impression that I am ready to order. I argue with myself: \""Do I want the You-Pick-Two? That sounds good, but do I want a sandwich, salad, or soup? Oh gosh, they changed the menu! That new seasonal salad looks good...so does that soup...and the sandwich. Wait, do I get a regular sandwich or a panini? Argh, I still need to decide on the second item! And a drink! Ahh!\""\n\nAfter another minute, I finally place my order. I take my receipt and the buzzer, get a glass of water, and find a seat (booth or table? Decisions decisions...). Once the buzzer goes off, I get my tray and sit back down. The presentation is quite nice, The soup is piping...warm? Okay, good enough. The salad looks great! I'm glad I got my dressing on the side; they sometimes drench my salad in dressing.\n\nFast forward to after I finish my meal. The salad lettuce was crunchy and fresh; the toppings were nice and tasty; the apple chips were okay, but got a little soggy when I added the dressing. I can't complain about the soup, except maybe it was a little watery (I'm talking about the garden vegetable soup for those wondering). Okay, time to clean up. Okay, what goes where again? Right, utensils in the small rectangular bin (*drop drop*); bowls in the larger bin...but I need to clean up the leftovers (blah! *spill drop bang bang bang*); napkins in the trash; tray on top. Okay, my hands are all gross now. Time to wash them....all washed! Time to go home!\n\nWell, I hope you enjoyed my somewhat disorderly thought processes in this review! Essentially, my experience at almost every Panera is the same. Decent food, nice staff, really good coffee, and good desserts. Breakfast isn't anything special; just overpriced oatmeal and breakfast sandwiches. I would rather make them at home instead of getting them here.",531,2
"I went here with a couple of friends for the Lunch Buffet on a Tuesday.\n\nThe decor and service are excellent. The platter was not extravagant but decent. May be we have just been spoiled by other buffets. The samosas were tasting good but were cold. Rest of the dishes all tasted the same. The ingredients changed but the taste was the same, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. For a restaurant, that has advertised all over LV bus shelters and supposedly been the best Indian Restaurant from 2001-06, it was quiet a disappointing buffet. But otherwise, there neither anything right nor anything wrong with the food. Just Okay.\n\nWill try the Ala Carte and may be that'll change my opinion.",154,2
"Hmm, this place really deserves a 1-Star review due to the lack of service but if she wasn't such a scatter-brain, this place would be 4-stars... Our waitress waited 20 mins before we flagged her down to serve us, had to flag her down for each refill of our drinks, had to flag her down for add'l orders... Lady was never around!\n\nTriple 7 is a micro brewery... And I have to say, EW. I had the pale ale and well, it goes in tasting like Sierra Nevada and once it settles in your stomach, UGH!!! Horrible after taste! That alone prevents me from ever drinking any of their brews-- EVER.\n\nThe saving grace for this review NOT being a 1-Star review is the fact that the guacamole burger wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be! LOL But when you slap some guac on anything, it always tastes 10 times better!\n\nBurger was good. Beer was \""EW\"" and the service was beyond horrible. Don't come here in a hurry... You'll have to wait a very LONG time.",245,1
"Want chinese and sushi for lunch but you are on a budget?  Well here you can have great tasting las vegas roll with some bomb orange chicken for $6.99.  You can't beat that price.  normall las vegas rolls cost between $7-$10 by themselves.  You also get a great tasting salad with some great house dressing.  They have other great lunch specials and variety.  Looks like a great hang out spot, great atmosphere.  I wasn't extremely full and wasn't hungry either, just satisfied.",115,3
"We recieved great service as soon as we walked in - from taking our coats to hang up, tucking us into our chairs, general friendliness and attentiveness with advise on how much rice and nan bread to order; a bit of humour thrown in and a hot towel to cleanse our hands at the end. \n\nI was suprised that there wern't many pakora options on the menu, however it contained a vast selection of other dishes including vegetarian, meat and seafood. We all opted for starters to begin with which were yummy. I had Panir Cutlet - shallow fried cheese - soooooo good and none of the grease that comes with deep fried foods. Normally I have a favourite Indian meal which I order pretty much in every Indian restaurant I go to but I went for something different this time - Kashmiri Murgh - chicken in a mild sauce with tropical fruit and exotic spices. There was plenty of it when it arrived and it was delicious - not too sweet at all! Unfortunately none of us managed to finish our mains because we were just so full from the starters. \n\nThis is the most enjoyable Indian meal I have had and it didn't leave me with a bloated feeling I normally get after eating Indian food. I will definately be more adventurous with my choices from now on too!\n\nThe restaurant itself is smallish but light and modernly decorated with a few pictures depicting scenes from India. I would have just liked to feel a bit more of India in the decor.",308,3

"It's 1:30 in the morning. I desperately want to sleep. The bed is comfy. The pillows are the appropriate level of fluffiness. The room is dark. Now if only I could turn off the music coming from Daylight - the outdoor beach club which spins until 3am on Sunday nights! On the 28th floor, with ear plugs and white noise blasting from my iPhone I could still hear the bass echoing in my room. When my husband called the front desk the not so helpful staff shared that \""it doesn't bother some people. \"" \n\nSo, if you are one of those people I totally recommend Mandalay Bay. However, if you like the idea of a quick afternoon nap (music also thuds all afternoon) so you can power through the night or might want to crash before 3am on a Sunday - MB is NOT for you.",185,0

"My friend talks about this place all the time. So when I came to visit..this was the first stop.\n\nThe food was really good, the service was far less. The only complaint on the food is they are not as generous as Chipotle with their guacamole. \n\nThe girl at the counter had serious sass.. Having worked in her position for four year- I would never mock a customer. You could tell she was local.. haha\nThey put chicken next to my burrito so they would know it had chicken, even though it was a vegetarian burrito, so I said: \"" I did'nt ask for chicken\"", and they all looked confused and all started asking each other \""is there chicken in here\"", \""hey did you add chicken\"" to each other. I thought that was taking too long, you either A. Let me check or B. Just make a new one without all the question asking. Since they didn't get the memo I just said \""I'll check it myself and just let you know\"". They didn't get it, so I repeated myself. (It's wasteful to instantly make a new one, so I wanted to make sure it was right before they threw it out.). The girl at the cashier proceeds to mock me and say, \""GUYS, She'll check it herself, she'll check it herself\"" in a very rude/ mocking manner.... Oh well, sadly many people don't have great customer service.\n\nRegardless of the rude employees, Cafe Rio is very yummy and if I stumble across another I would go back.",331,2

"Dirty rooms, rude staff, adolescent patrons.  Made the mistake of staying here for the night cause closer to airport and everything else was booked (should have been my first warning).  Looked out window - nice muddy view of pool and I think MGM - could not be sure (need to wash windows).  Beds were lumpy and we tried to keep everything off floor - just nasty.  When we got home, everything went right into the washer from garage -we were scared of bed bugs / roaches getting into our home.  Since we were staying of one night and were not big players - staff was apathetic at best.  We got in kinda late and didn't want to fight with traffic - so \""ate\"" at the  Hooters in the casino - will write separate review but in one word - HORRID!. To add to the \""fun\"" place was full to brim with really drunk 22 year olds.  They are loud, obnoxious and actually dangerous - we saw one pushing match and didn't feel safe; they were serving people that were so drunk they could hardly sit on the chair but as long as they put the bets down the drinks flowed.  Where was the casino security ?   Stay away, should have just gone to airport and sleep in terminal - would have been better.",269,0
"Ended up here for lunch since the place wasn't too terribly busy and it also happened to be participating in Three Square's LV Restaurant week.\n\nThere was no any special menu on display for Restaurant Week. Basically you got to pick off the regular menu but instead of the listed three meatballs you only got two with your choice of sauce, small size salad and ice cream sandwich for special price $20.13\n\nGot in my order and I waited... and waited ...and waited some more. My server did come to me and apologized 20 minutes later about the long wait. Kept myself entertained eavesdropping on convos...table near me was all gaga over Chef Carla, that's why they were there...the other table was complaining that the restaurant was out of 4 wines...then there was me still waiting for my food. 40 minutes past the hour both my salad and entree finally! Asked my waiter to go ahead and put in my order for the dessert so it would be ready by the time I finished up my meal.\n\nSalad was good, liked the chunks of Gorgonzola and the light dressing but it would have been nicer if the arugula and pears were a little colder.  The salad was at room temperature and had me wondering if it was sitting out there and just didn't get served to me on time.\n\nThe meatball entree: Portion wise fit the price. Which by the way is pretty reasonable. \nTaste wise: It was alright. I guess I was expecting more of the \""wow\"" factor being this was a renowned celebrity chef and all.  The texture was good but as far as the herbs, the flavor wasn't there. The pesto sauce was it's saving grace.  BUT Chef Carla's meatballs are not as good Bistro Pizza's meatballs and their meatball sliders. Chef Tyler nails it especially his marinara sauce!\n\nThe Bananas Foster came just in time.  The rainbow sprinkles gave it a fun looking presentation. The white chocolate shavings that surrounded the cookie was brilliant.  There was one problem though. The ice cream sandwich was frozen and hard as a rock! I tried digging into it with my spoon and it wasn't happening.  I took a butter knife from another table and started chipping away. Voila!! I finally I broke off a piece! The banana ice cream was pretty good. Too bad I couldn't eat much of the macadamia nut cookie though, it was frozen solid. Oh well so much for dessert. \n\nWhen I got my check the server said \""Yeah they'll know and I guess so\"" when I asked him if the proceeds will go to Three Square because I didnt see anything on the receipt since I was charged for regular menu prices.

"Elevated Japanese food with heart and character!\n\nYonaka has one of the best Happy Hour menus for premium food, but their entire menu ranges from good to great.  Don't come here looking for a cheap meal...that is not what kind of HH going on here.  What you are getting is a discount on some beautifully made items.  The menu is comprised of incredibly clean, balanced, and elegant flavors delivered in a composed and artistic manner.\n\nThe \""Modern\"" of their name refers to a whimsical fusion play that is incorporated wonderfully into their dishes.\n\nI usually want to know what items a place excels at, but at Yonaka, it really is more about what you typically like or are in the mood for because there is nothing bad on the menu and the vast majority is done exceptionally well.  I've heard people complain about the portion sizes, but considering the level and quality of the dishes here, I have to disagree.",199,4

OK, let's proceed...\n\nReview #26:\na fairly nice locals casino in Summerlin; I like it a lot better than the nearby Rampart/Marriott casino; the focus is definitely on gaming/slots, but there is a nice mix of other things to do here; decent cluster of dining options, and mercifully lacking the usual low-end food court that you'd expect; there is also a big multiplex theater here, and the upstairs features a large bowling alley; the sports book is quite big & impressive; there seems to be a lot of bars per capita here, which is always a good thing; best craft beer bet = the recently opened The Game sports bar easily takes the cake, with 20 craft beers on tap, including several local brews; plus, the food here is suprisingly good, and the waitresses are stuffed into hot referee outfits - yes, please!",295,2
"This seems to be a popular after-work spot for the locals. It certainly doesn't cater to young people or tourists, which is a nice change. When we visited the Bow Bar in 2008, they had a full range of real ales like Belhaven 80 and Caledonian Deuchars IPA. We also tried something called A Piddle in the Sun just for the name. (The names of the various brands of alcohol in Great Britain are great. An ale called Old Speckled Hen was one of my husband's favorites. There was even a brand of whiskey called Sheep Dung.) \n\nMy only disappointment was that although they had both Guinness and Bass on tap, they were not able to mix up a black-and-tan (I'm assuming because they didn't have one of those specially designed spoons to make the layers.) In spite of that, we'll probably be back to The Bow Bar the next time we're in Edinburgh. A real drinking man's (or woman's) bar - not a tourist trap.",223,2

"We came here with some friends and let me first say that their beer is pretty darn good. And that is coming from some people who love beer (my friends), and others (Jason and myself) who usually don't care for many types of beer. That was the highlight of the experience for us as far as I was concerned. \n\nThe room was way too noisy to hold a decent conversation, but as the theme of the restaurant seemed to be \""drink beer and get drunk\"", I guess I will let that slide. The waitresses were forced to wear these god awful costumes that were suppose to make them look like German bar maids but really just made them look frumpy, whether they were or not. And there was one poor decrepit 40 something who looked like she had prematurely aged due to partying to look more like she was 60, walking around with shots of Jager and a paddle that she was suppose to smack your ass with after you took a shot.\n\nNow the food would have been good if it was served on a plane, but that's about in the quality range that I found it to be. They came out with the plastic covers on them which indicated that they had just been heated up and sent out for us rather than prepared fresh, and upon tasting there was no doubt. The mashed potatoes were the instant kind, my chicken breast was a flattened out patty of a thing, definitely frozen and refrozen a couple of times, and the gravy tasted like it came from a powder. \n\nThey did have a good soft pretzel that they served with an awesome cheese dip, but at $10 for a pretzel, I could pass it up. \n\nMy friends really liked the place though, even though one of them got the same exact meal that I did, only with beef rather than chicken... Maybe I am just expecting too much. Then again, he did have twice the amount of beer that I did. Maybe that's the secret to enjoying this place. \n\nI would come here again, but only to have the beer.",436,1

"Texas is more known for its sliced brisket, but I was there at lunch and they only had the chopped brisket sandwich available for $6.99 with a side of twice baked potato wedges. Those wedges were crispy and above average, but the brisket was just average in the chopped form. Not sure why Texas places cannot replicate Southern chopped brisket, but it is never as good as down south or southern style places. It wasn't horrible, but the BBQ sauce was watery and did not add much and the bottom bun was soaked through, so no way was this going to be eaten sandwich style. The place was decorated with animal heads and other crazyiness and the parking lot is a very tight squeeze if your there at the wrong time. The waitress was very nice though and it's worth another visit to try something else.",167,2

"Doc & Eddy's is the crappy high school party for the non-high school crowd. It's uncomfortable and a little depressing, but if you repeat the ritual often enough it becomes a tolerable way to spend the evening. You just have to bring your own friends and take advantage of the cheap beer, because it's better with a buzz.\n\nDon't believe me? Let's think back to the dusty basement/garage/rec room that you and all your buddies used to hang out in during high school. If you had friends with money there were ping pong tables, air hockey, pool tables or video games. Of if your friends were more like mine, a TV with rabbit ears. (Doc & Eddy's is the kid with all the cool shit you never had, even though you volunteered to use the pool table as a bed in between games to save space.)\n\nInvariably the furniture had been cast off by surrounding rooms, relegating it to its current purgatory where collapsed cushions, cracked upholstery and wobbly tables may have mingled with bar stools and high tables, the occasional uncomfortable folding chair thrown in for the asshole that shows up unexpectedly and doesn't have anywhere to sit. Incandescent lights shone down on your little domestic beer swilling group and the walls were barren of adornment because you were too cheap to go buy some crap posters to put up over the yellowing wall paper, and mom didn't like nail holes in her dry wall. (Kinda crappy 70s seating. Nicely played, Doc.)\n\nBut you're pretty much the big shit because your parents are out of town, so you invite all your friends over and hope that some cool older kids come too. But that doesn't happen.

A gaggle of girls will descend upon the party later in the evening since they spent an hour getting their hair just right. They'll be wearing makeup that they applied more like spackle and dress in skin tight clothing that advertises every curve, muffin top and camel toe. \n\nSomeone will puke in the bathroom. Some other folks will get all surly and square off or shoot each other bitch eyes for the rest of the night. And you'll end up with something broken, adding to the overall depressing air of the dilapidated rec room.\n\nBut you'll do it all again next weekend.\n\nThat is Doc & Eddy's.",602,1
"3.5 stars. \n\nMy new favorite pho place in Arizona!\n\nMy parents house is only 20 minutes away from Little Saigon in Cali so I've always had my pick of good Pho. This place is pretty darn good, beats my usual pho spot, Pho Thanh in Phoenix. The broth is very flavorful and they have a good assortment of Vietnamese dishes. Prices are standard for this area. \n\nNormally I get the rare beef with flank or brisket, but I got it with just flank this time. Flank was more fat than meat so not sure if I'll get this here again. Maybe they just didn't have much meat today. Last time I got the rare beef with brisket, that was tasty . Regular size bowl is plenty of food, I usually can't finish it all. Got the Banh Xeo  today and though it was very flavorful and packed with shrimp, sprouts and onions, it was undercooked in some areas :( We've ordered the spring rolls before to go and they were good. \n\nMy favorite thing here though is their Lychee smoothie, its soooo good. They must put ice cream in it or something, its amazingly creamy and flavorful. I know they have many flavors but I always have to order this when I'm here!\n\nBig, clean restaurant, fast service, nice decor. Will definitely be back!",293,2

I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.

Also, I didn't know this going through the first time but they don't charge for additional toppings so definitely get what sounds yummy to you! I know this is a weird thing to enjoy about a restaurant but I really liked their ice- weird compliment I know. \n\nI will definitely return for a quick and yummy lunch and to chomp on the ice!",145,3
"Aside from one woman at reception this place has the rudest most uncaring, thoughtless staff I have ever had the displeasure of coming in contact with. These women (and I use the term lightly) all should sincerely consider going in to a profession that does not come into contact with the general public. I would be surprised if \""be a sociopath\"" isn't listed as a requirement to work at this God Awful place. If you are in need of any of the services offered here please do yourself a favor and chose ANY other establishment and go there instead.",115,0
"We wanted to go to Iruna but it had closed and praying monk replaced it, it was such a cool place! The food was eclectic and reasonably priced! It had an awesome atmosphere... Def a place I will revisit!",47,4
"We had my cousins birthday party this afternoon. As a chef myself, they started bringing out all the food all at once, guess what? They were all cold! Sinigang was bland, kare kare was also bland. \n\nI'm disappointed that the name doesn't hold its reputation at all!  I understand that most of our party was 15 minutes late but still isn't an excuse to serve cold ads, bland entrees. \n\nIts understandable that it's only a couple of months old but, management should've been prepared for such demand of this kind of chain here in Las Vegas. A town known for its culinary trends. \n\nAlso,  half of the restaurant was half full yet,  the amount of people waiting at the entrance is just ridiculous!  I strongly suggest getting things organized because that is a fire hazard with people clumped up at the door! \n\nYou should also train better bar servers/bartenders. The gentleman who had taken my drink order didn't even know what tap meant when I had asked him, what do u guys have on tap? He straight said. Sir what tap? Tap water? I'm like, WTF to that? He also did not know how to operate the POS system and how much my beverage was? Kudos to the other server who assisted the bartender. \n\nOverall wise, I will be back. But please remind the kitchen not to be afraid of a little salt and pepper. And if your kitchen staff wants to learn how to use proper seasoning?  Let me know ? thank you.",335,1
"I was grinning so hard when I finally made it here. Not just because it was a reprieve from the cold, but because it was only a mild shade of the picture the Yelp reviews painted (i.e. crackhouse, employees who can't speak English, dirty, so smelly it could knock you out, etc.) I was smiling because after debating whether or not I should go here (I wanted to make Tom Kha Gai), I saw for myself that it was A TOTALLY TYPICAL ASIAN GROCERY. I'm not talking H-Mart or E-Mart or Assi-- I'm talking like Chicago Food Corp. on Kimball or Brwyn Mawr Fresh Market (Yeah, I know some of you are laughing and nodding.) It was so funny thinking back on these reviews as I was checking out. Like, I was expecting something revolting. Too. Funny. \n\nSo yeah, it's totally fine. Don't let these crackers confuse you. It has a nice Asian stank in there. I'm still loling at that girl freaking her shit about seafood in boxes on the floor. Oh my god. Nevertheless, there are downsides to this place: cash and check only (you can pay a fee if you want to use a card), cramped as all hell, and dusty. \n\nI found my nuoc mam, chili oil, and fresh lemongrass. They have all the weird shit you need to make your stinky ass Asian dishes. They have a ton of cool sweets too.",318,3
"My saga with OnTrac -- A package was supposed to be delivered (yes, from Amazon) on Monday, November 12  - Veteran's Day.  Our business had its' doors open all day long, and our building was open as well.  On OnTrac's tracking details, the driver noted \""RECIPIENT CLOSED FOR HOLIDAY\""  and the package was not delivered.  Called OnTrac Monday afternoon and they said it would be given priority for yesterday, Tuesday, November 13.  At 4pm, I called OnTrac and they said they were having \""delivery issues\"" and the package would be delivered by 8pm.  WE ARE A BUSINESS that closes at 5pm.   I called Amazon, they were apologetic, but what can they do at this point?   I got into the office this morning and was heartened that there was a VM from OnTrac saying they were sorry for the mix-up and my package was given expedited delivery status.  At noon (still no package), I called OnTrac and they told me that the package would be delivered by 2pm.  \n\nI have notified Amazon that after all these years of great service using UPS and FedEx, why they (or their vendors) would go with this cheap, unreliable service is beyond me.  From now on, I am only going to do business with vendors who use UPS or FedEx.  There's a reason they're so big and successful -- YOU CAN DEPEND ON THEM!  \n\nBye bye Amazon...",329,0
"greatly pains me to do this, but this one star review is not tied to the food, but the lady that brings the coffee and water...she sat a coffee cup in front of me that was obviously used...it had the sip strip down the side, and drips else where...I called her back and said the cup was dirty..she told me that it wasn't dirty, that she must have bumped it while carrying it to the table...felt the cup, and the coffee stains were definitely dry...called her back again, and she asked if I would like a new cup...YA THINK! ..wow, that really fried me that she would even bring it in the first place, then try and lie her way out of replacing it...imagine the bacteria that could be on that cup, left by the former drinker....other than that the food was good as always, but this is a health hazard, and hope that management staff will cover this important issue with their coffee servers....",201,0

"My favorite place to go!! Love the atmosphere, just sitting on the deck overlooking the lake. Night time is fun too with open mic on Wednesday nights with Jon Linker!",36,4
Excellent burgers! $5 happy hour pitchers and specialty drinks as well! Ceviche was really good as well! Yum!,26,4
"Been going here for years! Food was Great, as always, however, our service was under par last night! Had to go ask for drink refills three times and our apps came out cold. It was half price wine, but my glass of house wine was still $6! Great place to work if you are a bad server, $80 gratuity added to our check!  Hope her assistant (Lisa's husband) got half. Next time we will ask for Lisa for sure! Food 4+ stars, service 1+, therefore 3+",115,2
My new dinner take out destination!!! Love their specialty rolls and fried rice! Crab jumping rice is my favorite! Love how they make our daughter's mini chicken jumping rice without any seasoning per request and with fresh ingredients only for $5! :),50,4
"Oh how I want to give 5 stars. Had I not had dessert, it would have been five. \n\nAmbiance is about as perfect as it can get in Vegas, love the view of the fountains. Staff and service exhibit perfection.\n\nTo date, probably the best meal experience ever. And their foie gras will ruin your expectations for any restaurant not up to this caliber. My husband will hardly order it anywhere now because he knows it won't be as good.\n\nDessert was very good, but not the best I've ever had and not the best way to end an otherwise exceptional meal.",131,3
"I went here on Friday with some friends for Madison's restaurant week (they were the only ones with reservations available).  We actually enjoyed it - the host was very nice and recommended a GREAT drink - the Passion Fruit Tea (or something like that).  It was delicious!  And I had 2!  I had the beef empanada and highly HIGHLY recommend this for an appetizer.  I thought it was fried perfectly and the cilantro mojo that was over it was very good....however the beef inside was only ok, I think it needed a few more seasonings!  I had the surf and turf - and I liked it, but it didn't knock my socks off.  To be perfectly honest - it seemed like the shrimp was boiled.  There was absolutely no flavor to the shrimp, but the peppers, onions, potatoes, and beef were pretty good.  For dessert - get the apple empanada.  It was SO good.  Thinking about it now makes my mouth water.  Our server was ok, it took a while to get our drinks and some water, but she was attentive - she may have just gotten busy.  I would recommend this place as a safe option for people, it seems they have a fairly standard menu.  I wouldn't mind going back, but I have to admit I'd like to try some other restaurants around Madison first!",283,2
"I came here tonight for the second time and devised a genius pie.  The first time, I remember it seemed expensive for Eric and I to get our custom pizzas, but this time I noticed there were two size options.  I am not sure if the 7 inch existed on our first visit.  I was over half an hour late to the party since I worked an event tonight, but Eric R., David S. and out of town friends visiting (Amy and David R.) all got their own 10 inch pies and none of them finished the full pie...because it is too big!\n\nI got the 7 inch, with the spicy diavola sauce, parmesan and ricotta, beets (yes, it is an item on the salad menu but I felt compelled to grace my pizza with it), and caramelized onions.  It was PERFECT!!!  I squeezed a fresh lemon slice on it and ....wa-la... soooooo good!  I am not sure if anyone else would order this (the staff said no one had asked for beets on the pizza before) but with these fine toppings AND an iced tea my total was under $10.  What a deal!  I am just floored because the combination of these simple ingredients created a happy celebration in my mouth and I would order this again!",271,3
"This is one of the very few places in the area who serve fresh food - as opposed to frozen or processed - the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars \n\nThe food is pretty good, but nothing exceptional. Portions are acceptable but not generous, pricing leans to the gourmet side of the equation more than the flavors do. The location is cute and eclectic. \n\nI seldom complain about service, which I'd describe here as Southern combination of polite words with unpleasantly brisk and rude manners at the same time. I don't want to rehash but I've eaten here a few times and never left with a good feeling, I doubt that I'll be back.",148,2
"My boyfriend and I decided to go here because we were waiting for our movie to start.  When we walked in there were 5 people standing at the hostess station.  After we were seated it took about 15 min for our waitress to come by to take our order.  We decided to share the Slider Sampler and an order for wings.  The wing flavors were very over powering.  We had to ask for plates, twice.  Also we had to ask for refills.  When we were ready for our check, it took a bit to find our waitress.  She was all around the restaurant.  She was nice, but not very attentive.  I probably won't come back.",145,1
"These guys won't last long. Phoned for a reservation, got message to leave a reservation request, left the message for a reservation (early evening). No call back. Tried again; no answer. Showed up to find they had booked the entire place for a full evening event. When asked why they did not call back to confirm or reject the reservation, they told me that was not their policy; it's up to the client to keep calling back until a real person is able to respond.  Now go figure on that one!",112,0
"Small strip mall location just south of Cactus on 94th (at Poinsetta cross street).  Very good crispy yet chewy crust on pizza slices, savory tomato sauce, and enjoyed the fried mushroom appetizer as well (large portion for the price).  Service was very personable and warming.  Prices were reasonable too.  Only about 8 tables here, so I'll go during off hours or just do takeout.  Would kindly recommend they get rid of the tablecloth condom covers - just clean the tablecloths or put glass over them.  The condoms don't exactly enhance the atmosphere.",121,3

"Perhaps I can't write a completely accurate review because I was sharing a hot dog and hamburger with a lame person who only wanted grilled onions on the dog and sauteed mushrooms on the burger  (seriously?? no effing beef chili, no cheese, no nothing!?  jesus).  But just based off the actual hot dog and hamburger, they weren't great. The hot dog wasn't the juicy, thick tube of meat I was anticipating.  Instead, it was a thin, dry, floppy thing that looked like one of those balloons you tie into animals.  \n\nThe hamburger wasn't much better - pretty overcooked.  The fries, however, were decent - crispy, fresh and hot.  I didn't get the onion rings, but they looked like they could have been pretty good too.",171,1
"Great place for lunch...Eat at the bar please?  Be prepared, great ambiance, but usually an older crowd.  I like the bar since the servers are older and more polite and know what food is good to order.  \n\nI would give it a 4 star, but 2 visits resulted in poor service from servers.  I get great service at the bar however?  Note sometimes Costco has a gift card $79.99 for $100 worth of food!  If you plan on visiting this place more then a few times stop at Costco and get that gift card.",127,2
"Surprisingly decent food for an Americanized Mexican place.  Strong margaritas, great chips and guacamole.  The tortillas for the tacos were stuffed with black beans, and the chicken had great flavor and a nice char.   Not a bad place to chill with some drinks and check out the view at Rehab.",62,2
"Had dinner there a few weeks ago when a friend stopped in town from San Diego. I feel like Arrowhead Grill is the\""Pride of the West side\"" so I was glad the restaurant was on top of their game. My only complaint is from the bar service. On the rocks means \""Pour the liquor in a glass filled with ice\"". Today's bartenders all think every drink needs to be shaken in a shaker first and THEN poured over a glass full of ice. That severely waters down the drink and by the way, that method is what's called an \""up and over\"". Which is NOT correct.  Other than that, the food was mostly awesome. One critique - their sides such as the cream of corn are not to my liking. It's just too thick. Best Prime in town in my humble opinion.",172,3
it is just off the strip you can see it out your window. it felt farther away because when i was there it was 128 one day and  over 100 most of the time  he hotel itself is just ok.  it had the nicest staff  of any hotel i have ever been in.  i had a problem with my credit card and they let me pay cash for the first night and then helped me get my card working.  any thing i wanted to know about Vegas they helped me figure it out.  they have a shuttel that goes for the hotel  to the airport and its free.  who ever is working one of them drives the bus. i give the hotel a 2 but  its getting 4 stars because of the staff,160,4
"Came here from the recommendation of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives on Food Network. We got their roast beef and mashed potatoes and Na's pasta, both of which were featured on Food Network. The roast beef and mashed potatoes was pretty decent. It was beefy with the whole thing slathered in gravy. The portion size was pretty large too. Their pasta was on the mushy side and was definitely not as enjoyable as the roast beef. \n\nThe atmosphere is a bar type area and was a bit smoky, but the service was very friendly. They seated us at the largest table in the back and we even signed their book listing names of people who found Nadine's through Food Network.",147,2
"In a strange turn of events - I found myself at Copper twice in two weeks after years of living in charlotte and never actually getting to eat here. Once for lunch and another time for Dinner. \n\nAs for the food: \nI understand from my Indian friends that this is not the 'best, best, best' Indian place int the city. How ever, Not being and expert in indian food I found both of my meals to be quite delicious. I had different varieties of Masala on both occasions and enjoyed very much what I had.\n\nThe service: \nI have to say that this is where Copper shined the brightest. On both occasions the staff was extraordinarily helpful and attentive in helping my party figure out what to order. They were very consultative and checked on us after tasting our food to confirm that we were happy with our choices. To me, this is the reason for my 5 star rating. I have have been to other Indian places, left to fend for myself and hated my order. Not so with Copper - it's truly a place where I felt comfortable ordering and knowing what to expect. \n\nAll in all - I give it 5 stars. \n\nThe staff really makes this place special.",259,4

"\""Breakfast (at) Epiphanies\""\n\nI come here for breakfast on Saturdays. Just once in a while, though.\n\nI'm the brooding one at counter's end, staring at the wall like a poster boy for autism, solving complicated problems, arriving at life-changing realizations. I'm aware that I should instead be gazing slack-jawed at a cell phone like most others but I'm capable of occupying my mind without mini-screens. Besides, my cell phone is just a phone, and I only turn it on when I need to make a call.\n\nAnyway, the coffee is good here, and the food tastes like it should.\n\nLast time I got corned beef hash; it came with bell peppers, onions, scrambled eggs, hash browns and toast, although you can substitute hash browns with seasoned potatoes if you want, and the toast with coffee cake for something sweet. Everything was good. I liked it.\n\nThe time before I went with the cakes and eggs combo which arrived with\neggs scrambled(my favorite way), two huge pancakes and sausage links, although you can order patties instead of links and bacon instead of sausage. I didn't care for the links so next time I'll get patties. But the cakes were good. Hot and fluffy like a freshly served souflee, which, I suppose, is kind of what pancakes are in a way.\n\nThis location does get crowded so plan to wait unless you're an early bird like me. They are open for lunch as well and the link below will show you their fare.\n\nhttp://www.thecrackedegglv.com/cracked-egg-menu-0611.pdf\n\nIf you make it here some Saturday and see me at the counter, feel free to ask what I'm thinking about.

"They are good for drinks, but other than that they don't care about you, even bottle service and talking to a manager they overcharge, after they over charge you they add to the price of every drink you order and want a tip, if you ask for the management to correct the BS you get a free shot that in no way makes up for the neglect you get when you get bottle service. Don't go here for a party and after I bought bottle service, the BUS BOY spilt beer in my girlfriend and I, overall a horrible night.",114,1

Not much different from any other bar/diner place you will find.  They have a few specialties which were delicious.  The Italian nachos and the pizza were delicious.  The Italian nachos are a must try if you like nachos.  A little bit different chips with Italian themed toppings such as Italian sausage pepperoni and marinara for dipping.  A must try and cannot wait to come back.,81,3
"Pretty standard bar food. I would not recommend it unless you were in the mood for simple fried or grilled food. Maybe a beer too if you're a middle-aged Packers fanatic. It's a cozy little old-American joint that honestly just reminds me of life in the suburbs, minus the gigantic portions.",65,1

"I took one of my cats here for a long overdue round of vaccinations. This is a preventative clinic and not a place to take your sick pets, which is fine by me. It makes for a much shorter wait.\n\nThe clinic is rather small, especially if two or more large dogs are in the waiting area. Staff is generally OK, although only the veterinarian said hello to me. The vet techs and receptionist pretty much directed me what to do and weren't really into small talk. But whatever; I'm at a animal clinic and I'm being too critical. If you just want to get your pets vaccinated or fixed for reasonable prices, this is the place to go.",142,2
"As far as service goes, this location is just like any other - although here they seem super friendly, having a personal conversation with you. Yesterday I got complimented on my glasses & how cute my dog Milo is. :)\n\nAt around 1 PM on a nice & sunny Saturday, it was still busy. As Chad E. aluded to, it's a pain to get & in of.  If the line in the drive thru is long, it's hard for those trying to get in and around the parking lot.  I was probably in line close to 10 minutes by the time I got to order.\n\nFood as always, was tasty. My nuggets were cooked perfectly & my coleslaw was filled to the top of the bowl.  My boyfriend's chicken strip salad was good too. Lettuce was nice & crisp, not brown. Chicken was cooked perfectly.\n\nI'm definitely a fan!",197,3
"I've only been here once and according to my friend, when he was here earlier in the year it was waaaaaaay better but I found the food very bland and warm, friendly service and cute atmosphere couldn't make up for it. \n\nWe tried the crab and artichoke dip and for dinner, inspired by Kitchen Confidential, I had one of their specials, a flounder filet with polenta. I'm usually expecting polenta to be this creamy, mushy puddle of heaven but here it was more like a quiche. So there was the flounder and a slice of polenta on their opposite sides of a plate, they didn't seem to go together. I wonder if it has anything to do with skipping out on the salsa that was supposed to go on top of the fish but I can't see how some chopped tomatoes would've made this any better. The dip was also plain and largely unmemorable. \n\nI did like the decor and the format, they have a smaller, quieter back room with just a few tables and a nice-looking, dark bar and more seating in the front. It's really romantic and I wish the food was tastier.",247,1

This is one of the places you go to if you are in the area and prefer not to go to an Italian Chain .\n\nThis weekend I tried the new Tagliani style Tilapia it was crusted in sun dried tomato and garlic and came with spaghetti squash a boatload of broccoli and a mountain of pasta  (approx $9.99) I thought it was good not great BUT GOOD and I really enjoyed the salad that I added on for a buck or two more with great house made blue cheese dressing .\n\nMy husband enjoyed his pasta with a sausage and he added a a big meat ball to try he said it was good and he also added the salad but got the Italian salad ( that was really GREAT! ) with meat cheese macaroni cantaloupe .\n\nWe've been here many times and based on multiple visits I have to say for us we find some meals here much better than others between 2 stars to almost 5 stars so 3 is fair and we go here instead of a chain place . \n\nFor two dinners with left overs that were good enough to bring home and a BOTTLE of decent WINE dinner was only approx $50. before tip .\n5-28-11\nas only a slight update I was recently here for Lunch for the first time and I was very happy with Lunch I had the special 1/2 Chicken artichoke Panini with salad this FOR SURE IS among the best in Lunch around this town maybe I need to up them a star,314,2
"This store was a major disappointment. It's on a dirty part of the strip, was crowded, and was totally and completely uninteresting. Even my daughter was bored. I thought the store would have a more interesting design...or at the least would have interesting products. All they have is excessive (and tacky) merchandising, a few extra colors of M&M's and that's about it. They don't carry any of the interesting M&M flavors or limited editions. Skip it and spend more time in the Coca-cola store.",113,0
"I've heard about this place for a while, and finally got to try it. I've seen tons of pictures from friends on facebook and boy, do they look amazing and delicious! \nWell... now that I've had the chance to try it, the taste is not exactly as amazing as it looks. First of all, its definitely overpriced. I ordered the \""Spicy Mojave Dog\"" thinking the nacho cheese (which I love), guac, and the spicy polish dog mixed together would be orgasmic. I don't know about what others think, but I thought the guac didn't have enough avocado in it for me to taste. The nacho cheese wasn't as cheesy as I would like, and so the only thing that actually met my expectation for taste was the polish dog itself. In the end, I wasn't even full! And neither were my friends. \nI guess this would be a good place to go if you were craving something greasy + hot dogs. I've had better hot dogs at local joints so I probably wouldn't choose to come back here if I had the choice out of all the places I could be eating at in Vegas. I was overall disappointed with the food quality especially when its priced at almost $10 a dog! If you're at Planet Hollywood, you might as well go for Earls.",284,1
I had my wedding cake made here. Very disappointed in customer service and quality if my cake. I had to call several times to talk with savannah the manager and come down to the shop 3 times to make sure they had what i wanted correct. So day of wedding came they said that the cake couldn't sit out for too long a couple hours so I changes the time of delivery and told them I needed the cake to be ready to cut and eat. It came frozen. I could barely cut the cake. It was also supposed to be just buttercream frosting and 1/2 inch fondant ribbon at the bottom of each layer of cake. My cake came all fondant which I did not want per their opinion that fondant doesn't taste that great. So I was disappointed that no one had called me and asked me about changing it to fondant. It was also too thick not rolled out thin enough so it was more frosting than cake. I emailed them to let them know about my disappointment and have heard nothing from them. This cake was about $600 with a discount coupon I had otherwise would have been $700. I'm giving them one star for the execution of the exact replica of the picture I gave them but that is not worth the price I paid for this cake. So if your looking for a wedding cake I would suggest finding another company to make your cake for your special day. I will not be buying or ordering anything from this bakery again.,299,0

"As my office is not far from here, I frequent this resturant for their lunch specials. Usually the service is excellent. Yesterday, I had an experience with a waitress who only had two tables, was slow with service, rude and not that intersted in her job.\n\nI had to wait so long for the check that I finally just plopped down 20 bucks on the table and left, leaving her a much bigger tip that I wanted to but I had to get back to work.\n\nWhen I informed the host of the terrible service he just kind of shrugged at me and said \"" sorry about that\""\n\nCome on people it was 11:30 am on a Tuesday only two occupied tables in the whole joint. Had to wait almost 20 minutes for my lunch and it was lukewarm.\n\nNeedless to say, wont be going back.",185,0
"A very special evening.  We were a group for a birthday.  We were pampered like there is no tomorrow!  The service staff gets 6 stars in my book.  Eating a Europea is all about the show and the extras.  Surprises after tasty surprises.  Why not 5 stars you may ask? The food was somewhat bland (I feel like I am committing a huge sin writing that).  I has scallops for my main course and it was... short on flavor?  The desert (besides the extra sweets and cotton candy and, and ,and...) was a spin on eggs and hash brown. No one around the table I think liked it!  At that point we were all full so no one said much.  Weird textures, weird taste, it just did not work.  My wife had the foie gras that was cook on a heated stone with maple flavor or vapors under a glass dome.  Spectacular but the foie gras was essentially raw and aaaaa... well a bit slimy.  We both love foie gras but this was weird.\n\nFor the rest, the calamari carbonara was yummy, the lobster cappuccino like nothing you ever had, and on and on.  \n\nSo I am torn.  I think I will have to go again.  On the other hand, so many other places to try and so little  time.",286,3
"I came in knowing I would have to either replace my transmission or get it rebuilt. \n\nWhen they did their free inspection, they said that they will need to do a more thorough inspection and charged about 280 (not exact but close to that amount). We didn't know the area so we decided to do the inspection to see what it could be. They later on tell us that it was just a simple solenoid. Which wouldn't cost as much as a replacement of a transmission or a rebuilt. \n\nWhen they lifted up the car and took the transmission apart, they told us that an motor mount was broken and we should get it fixed. (That meant more money) We got the motor mount fixed. \n\nAfter all that was done, the car was still having the same problem and nothing was really fixed. We ended up being out almost 400 and with still the same problem we came in there with. \n\nThey said that there is nothing else but to just either get it rebuilt or get a brand new transmission. Getting a rebuilt they would've charged me 2200. I just decided that was just way too much.\n\nI went to another place which was a lot cheaper than Paladin. And when I got my car fixed, the mechanic said that one of my solenoid was broken. (That would only mean that when Paladin was fixing my car, they broke my solenoid when they had it cleaned and put back into my car) That cost me more money to fix. =[ \n\nI have to admit though, the staff was very friendly and courteous. We didn't put up a fit and just paid them because they did spend the time trying to fix my car. They did try to save me money in hopes it was just a simple solenoid, but in the end . . .it cost me more than save.",394,1
"Played at Shelly Sharpe, a.k.a. Vista Del Camino yesterday with a buddy of mine. I hadn't played here in a few years but it was great to get out, walk the course, and hurl the Frisbee's around the park.\n\nI really enjoy playing here as its an easy walk and the park is nice. They change up the location of the baskets from time to time which makes it an interesting play whenever you get out. The most challenging part is the #1 hole which you have to toss over the water as well as a few other holes where the water is in play. \n\nI'd recommend that you are equipped with footwear you can remove fairly quickly just in case you have to get in that nasty pond to find a disk you let get away from you on an errant drive (if you're willing to do that). My buddy and I both had to dip our feet into the water to rescue our discs yesterday. Despite the pond hazard, this is a great place to get in a quick round of disc golf in Scottsdale as the park is in great shape and it is tended to pretty well.\n\nAn added bonus of playing here is that Spinners on the Green is located in the shopping center adjacent to the park. If and when you lose a disc to a tree or the pond, they're right there for you to scoop up a new Frisbee or two before or after a round.",301,3
"Came here on a groupon and glad I did. I see behind the counter an aging, white guy at a place called Devil Hotz and figure I should stay away from the Mexican food and veer towards the more East Coast food. Everything, no matter gets home fries and mac salad. I decided on the Philly cheesesteak. \n\nWhat a disappointment. I swear the meat was Steak'ums and the green peppers had this very weird clove flavor to them. The home fries were just potatoes, no peppers or onions. The mac salad was noodles and mayo, no flavor besides me drenching the only topping around on it, Trappey's hot sauce. I'll return to try their Mexican food just because I never make a decision based on one visit. First impressions though, don't waste your time unless you want a pound of cheap, flavorless filler.",182,1
"Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy Sexy\nI ATE: Endive salad, Eggs Benni, Mojito Pitcher, Mimosa \nEndive Salad.... Balanced flavors with Blue cheese nuts & a light dressing. The salad was chopped in small bits. Love\nEggs Benni.... totally amazing hollandaise, eggs poached to perfection & we subbed bacon for avocado. The chef came to our table to make sure the flavors were balanced without the bacon. \nMojito Pitcher..... Jesus himself would have given into this one. It was as big as JLo's booty & had 2 very loooong very Hot Pink straws (my fav color). It took us 2 hours to finish & we were in Party mode half way into it. \nMimosa..... I don't remember if it was good or not but I drank it so.....\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE......FABULOUS!!!!! Our waitress was Rad. She comped us our $165.00 Mojito pitcher just because she thought my Hubby & I were cute & Nice! Seriously our bill ended up being $45 for food. Of course we took care of her but still.....how sweet it that! Personally I think she had a crush on me..... The DJ was bangin & i danced on our table for almost all of Brunch. There were the hottest Burlesque dancers to entertain us while we ate & during peak season they have acrobats as well. This place was white & hot pink with a Huge Crystal Chandelier in the middle of the room. I WAS IN HEAVEN....YOU MUST GO!",336,4
"I love the idea of this bar \""Homemade in small batches with love\"" + $4.50 all beer (so simple!) The beer selection varies and it's relatively small (compared with some of the other beer bars in town), but the staff are incredibly informed about the beer making process. \n\nOne thing though, the red hot pickled egg was not a good choice. The name should have given it away -  red hot and pickled - not a good combination. Though for a dollar, it's washes down ok with the strong ale... I've give it five stars if it had a better food menu.",131,3
"Ambience and room was sufficient, however the service left something to be expected. We were so excited about staying in this chic looking hotel with the newer city centre section of Vegas. Two other people that I stayed with stayed at the Aria and immediately stated that the two were not comparable. Meaning Aria was way better especially service wise. When we checked in the hotel attendant welcomed us with a smirk and got on the phone to ask about giving us an accessible room as the deluxe booked rooms were all sold out. Ok, my friend mentioned that we were celebrating her birthday and the attendant states that she would see what she could do. When we reserved our room we booked through the hotel's website we thought we were taking advantage of the stay two nights and get a $50 food and beverage credit. However when we checked in we had to remind her or the offer after she said she didn't see anything like that. That really gave me a bad first impression vibe and little did I know the room service would be even worse:( when we finally got to our room on the 20th floor we had a nice view of city center. The decor was nice and we had a kitchenette for our convenience. Since it was accessible space wasn't an issue. Later that night we requested extra blankets and towels and never received them. So I'm the morning I was stuck waiting again for towels and could not shower or anything until they came. That night we found that the pull out bed had springs sticking out and decided to go to the front desk to express our concerns. The attendant apologized and promised when they cleaned the room we would have two extra feather beds for the pull out. To our surprise that evening we had nothing. So we called and express more concern and they informed us that the promise of two feather beds should not have happened due to the fact that the two could damage the bed but that they would honor what we were promised. After 30 mins they brought the beds and other requested items. Our last incident came when we left the next day and called for our room to be service after we left around 3pm. When we returned at 6:30 our room had not been serviced. We called once again and they apologized which at this point meant nothing...gave the resort fees back, bottles of water and more towels...our trash was over flowing and dirty towels were everywhere...it was a gross feeling all night and morning. I ran out promising never to book the Vdara again!",509,2
"The majority of the food was tasty and obviously prepared by a skilled chef, but I had too many issues with Aizle to feel I want to return. From the list of ingredients many were not presented to us in any dishes. The 4 courses turned out to be 7 or 8 and there were significant gaps between each, which all took only moments to consume. Maybe I just don't enjoy this kind of dining experience, but we were there for 2 and a half hours and it felt like it was dragging. The cocktails were nice but not amazing, The service was over the top - being interrupted constantly to fill wine and water glasses became more than annoying and we felt that we kept having to stop talking for our own privacy. Didn't seem to fit the otherwise quite casual dining room and presentation of the staff.  It is a really nice fit-out inside. But not my kind of place.",188,2
Food is above average but the value is average. Wait times during lunch can be quite long. Good veg options is that is your thing.  Overall nothing that strongly makes me want to go back.,41,2
"First, I have to say, totally not what I expected. I guess I expected a Filiberto's experience. Instead I walked through the door and they offered to seat me. The place was very quaint but well laid out for it's size. However, I decided to get my food to go as I was in a bit of a rush today.\n\n I ordered the \""La Merced\"" signature house torta and a large horchata. The horchata which is a Mexican rice drink, was outstanding. Best horchata I have had in years. When I was handed my food, I thought something was wrong. The box weighed as much as a half gallon of milk. I went to my truck and could not wait till i got home to see what was in the box of food she gave me.\n\nI opened the box and my eyes popped out. It was the sandwich from hell. Now I admit I am caucasian and have tried most of the Americanized Mexican food joints and I like  the Filiberto's  type places too, but this was a whole new something different.  The menu stated that the sandwich had chorizo, eggs, ham, sausage, and chicken on it.   I was thinking YES BREAKFAST SANDWICH... Wow was i wrong.\n\nWhat I got was this HUGE Bun that was Super Tasty. On it was mayo, pico, guac, a chorizo, egg and chease omlete. Couple slabs of ham, Some weird chicken fried steak looking thingy, and 3 hot dogs split in half and grilled.  I laughed my butt off looking at this thing. This looked like something one of my stoner friends would have come up with during a case of the munchies.  I decided I had to take a bite and I have to say.  I was impressed. The bun especially is very good. I was a fan of everything except the hot dogs and chicken fried steak looking strips.  Just to be clear I am not a big hot dog fan to begin with so I cant take a star off for that.. Over all the Sandwich  taste was about 3 stars. The horchatta was 5 stars. The staff was very nice, 4 stars. \n\n\nSo all in all I have to give it 4 starts for a Huge Meal at a decent price, Prompt courteous service, and excellent house made Horchata",493,3

"Discovered this place during business trip to Scottsdale. Loved it so much went back twice! Fabulous happy hour, great small dishes, fun vibe, and decent beer/wine selection. Live music on Thurs, Fri nights & festive outdoor patio area with big screen tv's & gathering spots to hear the music or to just chill. Pork ragout with asiago polenta and basil was killer (scrumptious!) & the fried green tomatoes were good too. Wish I'd had the duck fries though. Our first night's service with Lauren (during a Thurs eve) was awesome & the live music (Ryan Sims) was fantastic; 2nd night back the bartender & our server weren't as attentive or stellar (maybe because it was a Sat night). Still, if I lived in the area, I'd be a regular here. The menu is incredible.",177,4

"I ordered through eat24.com at around midnight.  The website stated that I could expect my food in 45-60 minutes.  When it did not arrive in 70 minutes, I called to check the status of my order.  Without even asking what my order number was, the woman on the other end of the phone told me that all of her drivers were out with food, and that I should have my food \""momentarily\"".  30 minutes later, I got a call from the delivery driver, who was lost and talking on the phone while driving.  He dropped his phone twice, explaining he had passed by a highway patrolman.  Unable to get him to take simple directions to my apartment, I ended up meeting him at a nearby gas station to pick-up my food.  When I got home with my food, the fries were tough and crunchy, but aside form being overpriced, the rest of the food was not bad.  Customer service is seriously lacking!!!",208,0
Failure from customer service to location to taste. COMPLETE FAILURE!!!\n\nThis is the worst Wingstop I've ever been to and I'm a big Wingstop fan. In my old city we had over 5 wingStops and they were delicious with excellent taste and customer service... But this place is terrible from location to customer service you can barely see the place and once you go in there you will never want to come back.. The employees are scared to work because the owner watches them like a hawk like they're in prison campus it's completely sad.. Normally Wingstop gives you free extra ranch if they forgot to ring it up but they also made me pay for it and swipe my card all over again it was a disaster. I've actually met the owner once he sits in the back corner on his Apple Computer and bosses people around and the complete most ridiculous way possible,182,0
"Coming from Charlotte, I'm an airport snob. This was the best airport I've been in besides Charlotte-Douglas, though surprisingly large. There were a multitude of restaurants scattered throughout, though a very long walk to access them from certain gates. The airport gambling provided something entertaining to watch while waiting for the plane. On this Saturday, the airport was near empty and even the TSA looked bored. Refreshing to have an airport experience that wasn't hectic and confusing.",97,3
"Don't go here!! I don't normally stays in a motel but I thought it will be good since I found this motel through my united mileage plus. I paid this motel for my 10150 miles which definitely not worth even $25.00 a night!

Even if you reported them to the front desk or manager it doesn't help at all. They stopped knocking by 10am.  Maybe they got tired. Arghh if only I can give no stars!! Going back to this motel most of the guest are rowdy, kids or not kids or maybe some horses (not sure what they are since I didn't see them outside) are jumping up & down, couples next door are fighting loudly! And best of all the location is near this ghetto apartment complex w/c people are shouting when they are just talking each other! I will definitely coming back or even near this motel ever!

"Was doing some Christmas Shopping with my Son and decided to stop by this joint based on the great reviews we saw on Yelp.  I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered Wings w/Med Sauce ($10), Sliders w/Fries ($10), and Momma's BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger w/half Fries & half Onion Rings($10).  Our server Joanna, who was very nice, helped us select these items.  First up was the Wings.  They were pretty good.  Joanna recommended getting the Med Sauce for the flavor but having the Hot Sauce on the side for the heat.....it worked!  It was very good.\n\nMy Son had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and it was huge!  He said he enjoyed it.  I tried some of his Onion Rings....they were thick, crunchy, Beer-battered, and soooo good!  The Onions had a nice sweet flavor to them that went well with the Beer-batter crust....pure awesome!\n\nMy Sliders were pretty good....I wouldn't say they were great, but good.  They were slightly overcooked....well done.  I think the cook took them off the grill Med-Well and then it got Well-Done between the kitchen and the table.  They had good flavor though and the Bread was really good...the best part of the dish.\n\nOverall, we had a great lunch and Joanna was especially helpful.  She has a great personality and made us feel welcome and special.\n\nWill we return?  We spotted a few other items on the menu we want to try, so next time we're in the area, we plan to come back.",385,3
Originally I had given them a terrible rating because their customer service was horrid..However I'm happy I gave them a second chance because I am beyond impressed with Richard. He was great with my 90 lb shepherd husky mix and the two hit it off instantly.

"Haven't been here since giving up gluten, though I came here a few times in the last few years. The first time was very much a motivated visit, the other times I just ended up coming here as a part of a group.\n\nThe location is fantastic, the interior is very smart and comfortable, the ambiance is quite nice. The menu is pretty exciting, offering plenty of seemingly authentic Italian dishes. I saw focaccia, caponata, homemade ravioli, risotto, pizzas, salads and pastas, calzone, polenta chips, and much more... The prices came as the first shock. \u00a39.45 for a mushroom risotto? \u00a38.50 for spaghetti aglio e olio. \u00a39.95 for a calzone??? I realize that Italian restaurants can get away with such high prices in this country, but I don't understand why. Flour is cheap, tomatoes are relatively inexpensive, and pizza requires very little cooking time.\n\nThe food is rather disappointing, considering the prices and pretensions. On one occasion I had a pizza here. It was small, the toppings were sparse, and the base wasn't that crispy. I had the vegetarian lasagne, which was just two layers of lasagne sheets swimming in a dense creamy cheesy sauce, which was quite nice, but not really what I was after. The ice cream here is extremely disappointing, the pistachio is very green and obviously artificial. It's a world away from the extremely creamy nutty, earth coloured pistachio gelato in Italy. I once took a tiramisu away, and found that it was just a creamy pile of... sweetness. I couldn't taste the coffee or the marsala wine. It cost \u00a34.95. I'd rather have Robbie's mother's recipe, thanks. \n\nThough they offer gluten free pasta and pizza, I don't think I would be inclined to return, having read Claire L's review. \n\n It's only worth trying out this place if you have the Vittoria card which offers a 50% discount on certain days.",453,1
"Overpriced for what you get. The burger was dry and not worth $15. I could get a better burger at Smash Burger for $8. I ordered the waffle fries and they were over cooked and seemed like they sat for awhile before being served to me. Also tried the marshmallow shake and it just tasted like vanilla ice cream, also not worth the $8. I would not return here. Save yourself from being disappointed and don't go here.",94,0
"Bland, uninspired, mushy.\n\nI had 2 fish and 1 bean taco. The beans were good - the rest of the tacos, not so much! They were kind of slopped together. No fountain drinks - cans and bottles only. So much for being eco-friendly hippies.",65,1

She was not a happy camper but the delicious fudge made up for it.\n\nThis place is way out of my budget and I would never buy any of the necessities for outdoor life here but I purchased some novelty things and will continue to come back.",127,3

"After reading a few reviews, this place gave me the Bagel Cafe vibe, and it's not too far from me so I decided to give it a try. I went with my family and another family so we had a party of 7. They managed to accommodate us pretty quickly. The service from beginning to end wasn't bad, but it wasn't extraordinary either. At least half of our party started with the chicken noodle soup that they're famous for. I enjoyed it very much, but I did notice I had way more noodles than my boyfriends bowl. Between us we ordered an East Coast type sandwich made with Taylor Ham (a personal favorite) it was piled 4 slices high with American cheese and raw onion. Good sandwich. An order or chicken fingers, a BLT (too much L), an open faced roast beef, a burger (big but average), and a side of chicken salad. Ill go back for that chicken salad alone, it was one of the best I've ever tasted.\nTowards the end when we paid, we gave the waitress our bill that was only about $2 over. We were going to leave the rest and main part of her tip on the table as we collected it all. Well in the mean time she gave us dirty looks and assumed we only were leaving her that as a tip and talked smack to other employees. It was a little funny and annoying at the same time. As for a Jewish deli, ill stick to bagel cafe, but return here for Taylor ham and chicken salad Togo!",315,2

"I was in Wisconsin for training for the week and this place was close to my hotel.  Also, they had fried cheese curds on the menu which I HAD to try!  I had been hearing about these things for weeks from my coworkers who have already been out there. It was a Friday evening and the place was pretty packed. The atmosphere was typical suburban bar. Not too rowdy, but loud. I'm not a beer drinker, but the Pinot Noir was good! :o)\n\nWe had to wait a few minutes before our waiter came. The fried cheese curds were good! They tasted like fried mozzarella sticks to me, but still pretty good. My coworker got a burger and I got a deluxe grilled cheese sandwich that we shared. Both were really tasty and filling. She decided to try the clam chowder and it wasn't that great. I may be a little biased, but I don't buy seafood in the Midwest. Unless it's deep fried in beer batter and served with fries. The specialty is meat and cheese. Seafood, I'm sticking to the east coast. I decided to try the sweet potatoes fries which were very good. \n\nOverall I liked this place. It was walking distance from our hotel, the people were friendly and the food was good. It was a nice place to have a laid back and chill meal after a long week.",288,3

One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately. You either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. WTF?",196,1

Long story short we were gathering the money for the bill, but we didn't want to leave the tip on the table until we were getting ready to leave...however, this guy was really insistent that we give him the tip now. Slighty put off, but still being polite we wanted to make sure we left an appropriate tip - yet he stood there almost demanding that we give him the tip now. *sigh\n\nAnyway, if it wasn't for the awful waiter at the end I probably would have given this place four stars.",199,1
"Another date night ends in disaster, well almost. My husband and my date nights are cursed, usually ending in violent bowel issues, vomiting, car accidents - you name it, we've probably experienced it, all in the name of a romantic evening. Monsoon season hits, and there goes the electricity/AC at Latitude Eight, the Thai wonderland we live down the street from and have been wanting to try for over two years. This is of course the fault of Mother Nature and not the restaurant. The staff was extremely gracious and kind, calling us \""troopers\"" for saying to eat.

"We have been here several times for the great beer selection. However, the past three times, the service has been HORRIBLE. The bartenders are distracted and inattentive, to say the least. The support staff is awesome and tries to help the best they can, but they are at the mercy of the bartenders. And we have yet to see a bar manager who checks in to make sure things are going well...maybe there isn't one? Anyway, despite the awesome beers, we've given up. Sigh....",110,0

"3 sliders 3 different meats should of got them made well instead of medium rare.\n\nNot to far away from the hotel I was staying at, gave this place a shot with a recommendation from one of our coworkers, \n\nhere are the choices I had and the verdict for each\n\nBUFFALO **- made medium rare by request, let just say I should of asked for it well done, from the outside all appears good, until you hit the center which was a bit more alive then slightly cooked, I know my fault for ordering a burger med-rare, sadly the center was raw like when you get ground beef from the grocery store out of the package grab a big spoon and chow down without cooking it raw, the outside of the burger was a light brown so probably a 1minute cook on top and bottom, presentation wise it looked excellent sadly way undercooked made me lose my appetite\n\nLAMB *** - made medium rare by request, again served raw, slight brown outside but alive inside, slight gameiness as expected from lamb, this one I did not mind so much it being raw there was flavor, the feta meshed well with the grape tomatoes, even the meat was raw I would probably order this again possibly well done next time\n\nEXOTIC ***- made medium rare by request special meat of the day was Kangaroo hella yeah imma bite down on something from down under wait wut??? hahha since the meat was nothing I've had before I had nothing to compare it too, again I should of ordered the burger well instead of medium rare or in there case alive with a slight char, meat was very lean, reminded me a lil of gator if not slimmer version of chicken, possibly pheasant. not to happy with the prep but again I had nothing to compare it too.\n\ntater tots ***** sadly this was the most enjoyable dish, fried to a point where all you do is bite and it disintegrates in your mouth with a kick of what tasted like cajun spice and helpful 4 sauces to choose from\n\nif you do come here request the burgers to be made well, which will probably come out medium, beware if you ask for medium rare, you will get simply rare\n\nfood ** for burgers ***** for the tater tots and sauces\nservice *** half smiles, \""hurry up and buy type attitude\""\nambiance *** over open venue literally doors open even at night\nprice $$\n\nehh I would come back but definitely would try to order everything well done sadly medium rare was scoop from raw tray and serve it up like it was cooked haha",545,1
"I was very excited to try this place based on the reviews but it was pretty disappointing. We arrived for dinner at 7 which is about two hours before they closed and were informed that they were out of chicken which eliminated about half the menu options. They were also out of two beef dishes which *really* limited out options. My fiance had a beef dish with peppers that promised \""Peruvian\"" fries which just turned out to be steak fries, nothing unique about them. I had a fish dish that was very overcooked and extremely salty. My fiance enjoyed his cilantro rice though. \n\nOverall, it was disappointing that they would run out of so much food at only 7:00. My fiance would try it again if we knew the full menu was available but I would not order fish there again.",167,1
"My fianc\u00e9e and I used to come here a lot and the food was good.  Must be the gas prices cause the quality and portions have suffered.\n5 small strips of steak for fajitas is SAD.

"Grimaldis gets a big yay from me. The pizza is flavorful, fresh and very very yummy. I love the crust its thin but not too thin, the sauce is just right and the toppings are plentiful. Only thing is, my pizza gets cold by the time I've finished scarfing down the first two slices. We normally get two pizzas, one for each, and I just wonder if mine comes out first and sits there a few minutes before the other comes out. Almost everytime we go my pizza is on the cooler side. So I guess that would be my only complaint. The cannoli is reallllly good too, a definite must try. When the weather is pleasant, sit outside on the patio that over looks the water, very nice. So if you're looking for a good pizza and a nice restaurant, Grimaldis is a place to try.",178,3
"I was in the Downtown area and was having some drinks over at the old Fitzgerald's which is now \""The D\"" and sitting next to me was a chef that worked at Hennessey's. I told him I was in the mood for a burger and he said that his restaurant has some good ones.\n\nSo we walked on over for some dinner. We ordered some onion rings that came with Spicy BBQ sauce. I don't know what level of spiciness they were talking about... but it just seemed like plain ol BBQ sauce to us. We would have liked to have a side of Ranch, but the waitress didn't arrive till after we finished them.\n\nWe put in our main order and it took about 15 minutes to get our food. I asked the waitress what her favorite burger was and she said \""The Frisco burger\"" and my mom ordered \""\nHennessey's famous burger\"".\n\nWhen the food came, my burger which was sourdough bread toasted with cheese, was kind of cold and hard. The actual met was hot... it seemed as if the bread was sitting there for awhile. My moms burger came and it was average. I ended up ordering a coke, when she brought it, it was flat. I asked if she could replace it, and she never came back. She ended up apologizing 20 minutes later when she brought the bill that she forgot.\n\nAll in all this place had decent customer service, and the food was subpar. Go elsewhere.",319,1
"We tried this place only because it had a coupon and what a mistake.  Spring rolls were so greasy the wrapper was soaked within the 5 mins it took to drive home.  Then blotting with paper towel soaked up another full towel full of grease.  Dipping sauce was gelatinous. Orange chicken was tough and breading soggy.  Took loads of antacid to get over this meal.  On the plus side the counter girl was sweet when she rejected the coupon because small print said dine in only and only within certain time frames.  Really!  Not the best way to garner new business for your \""grand opening celebration\"".  Coupon flier said Grand Opening Celebration but it appeared to be the same storefront operation that has always been there next to Domino's. Teriyaki beef was nicely flavored but consistency a little slimy",169,0

"I really do not like this theatre, but I keep finding myself going back there time and time again.  This is clearly a love hate relationship, or as Dane Cook would say, a relationshit.  \n\nSo why do I keep going back?  Well, they are close to me.  I can practically walk to this theater and sometimes that just trumps going to Harkins Arrowhead or Deer Valley 30.  \n\nThe problems with this theater in order of severity:\n\n1.  They charge California prices.  They are way too proud of their tickets and that is what is keeping this theater half full all the time.\n\n2.  Their food quality is on the extreme low side.  Seriously, every item is just \""off\"".  Be it the popcorn, the stale nachos, or the $4.00 small cup slushies...it just is not good.\n\n3.  Their food is pricey.  Way too expensive for the quality experienced.\n\n4.  The seats and theaters are just kind of \""bleh....\""\n\nSo despite all this, I will most certainly be back, but I will grumble the whole time.  : )",261,1

"We asked our concierge for a decent family restaurant to go to and he provided a couple of suggestions including beaver hall (bh).  I had walked past bh earlier in the day and it appeared slightly formal so  I asked the concierge if iWeb might be under dressed however he assured me that MTL is casual in the summer.  I entered bh at approximately 8pm and the place was half full at best.  The maitre d asked if I had a reservation (code-I want to go to the peeler joint in half an hour).  We were seated and our initial waiter came to take our order-he was actually quite pleasant.  Food arrived and waiter 2 (I'm going to line up for Celine tickets!) put (left) my wife's order at another table and gave me my daughters kids meal.  We thought maybe he was in a hurry to serve the other  remaining 2 tables (OMG 4 more hours for Celine-I need to shower).  Anyways food was bland but too my surprise no one came by to give the food quality check-how is everything, no one asked - would you like another cocktail (I love Celine!).  Now the mad rush to clean up started and chairs and stuff started to fly by us.  My daughter could not finish her meal and asked waiter 2 if he could pack it to go.  Waiter 2's reply was sure \""if you really want to\""!  After being provided the desert menu we reminded waiter 2 that the kids meal included desert and he said yeah okay-we were sitting around guessing what that might be?  We were pissed offf waiting and wondering if we were taking up everyones valuable time however no one was around to flag down for the bill.  When we saw waiter 2 we asked if we were taking up too much of there valuable time and we should leave.  He said no no like who me?  We paid the bill and left feeling disappointed and dissed.",409,0
Raincheck....close convienent just don't get nothing fancy. Regular wash is ok. They really push for a mega wash.

No limit on rainchecks lol but who had time to keep going every day within the 72 hours. Of course I asked that. Sometimes it's nice to have a clean car.,108,2

"I was there, along with family (including 2 kids ages 7 and 8), for a four day work/play stay.  We reserved a villa to accommodate the four of us.  The good points:  (i) the villa was comfortably sized and had a full kitchen; (ii) the food -- both in the Pinon Grill and from room service -- was well made and tasty; (iii) the staff is courteous, helpful and go out of their way to do things that are above and beyond; and (iv) the grounds are lovely and well maintained.  The bad points: (i) the place is very dated and it is clear that the main hotel and the villas have not been renovated for a long time -- probably since the early 1980s, judging from the decor; (ii) the villa we stayed in was quite run down -- the blinds are bent, missing pieces so that people can see right into the master bedroom, the TV is an old, old model (but worked fine), the carpet is shabby; (iii) the plumbing in the second bathroom backed up twice; (iv) room service dishes not cleared for two days even though they were called every day and promised to do it each time; (v) at night in the living room, hundreds of black flying midges swarm along the ceiling above the lamp - it was disconcerting; and (vi) housekeeping is lackluster and they forget to stock things like toilet paper.  Having said that, the price charged was very reasonable and the hotel is in a nice location with access to nearby running trails and urban parks.  The kids actually loved the place.  On balance, I would not go back - I am happy to pay more for better accommodations and no plumbing problems.",365,1

"Just thinking about the level of service that I received makes me cringe. The service is the polar opposite of what someone would consider a good experience. I think that the issue with these \""superstars\"" lies around the fact that they can't listen to save their life.  \n\nNothing makes me happier than expressing that I'm allergic to mushrooms to the lady over the phone and finding that my order of \""Crispy Spicy Beef\"" has more mushrooms than beef in it. I checked my receipt and it actually does say no mushrooms. Regardless as to whether the to-go lady punched in the order correctly, the fact still lies that she was too wrapped up in gossiping with her co-workers to check and make sure that my order was correct. I work in retail and I ALWAYS double check and make sure that I've gotten the customers request correctly. \n\nAlso, why the fuck do I order soup and get it in 5 different coffee cups? They keep expressing that this is a temporary fix  until their shipment comes in and is by no means permanent. They've been saying this for the past 2 months....\n\nI guess if you want a job at cheesecake, mediocrity shines, so shoot for the bare minimum and you'll be a star.",266,0

Member only sales on these items a few times years, the sales can be hit and miss. It turns into a mad house but you might make some great finds at great prices. SALE sale SALE!! and coupons in the mail. \n\nThis week I bought 1 pair of columbia hiking shorts originally priced at 40$ marked down to 19$, an Osprey day backpack for my hydration bladder at 35$ priced at 60$ originally. Plus some socks and a couple of those gross gel packs ( I know but I am doing a 30 mile in one day hike hoping they will help me through mile 29 when my knees begin to buckle). After I threw in my 20.00$ off coupon for being a member I got all that for a little over 50$. So if you play your cards right the prices come down. \n\nAs for larger items many can be found at cheaper outfitters, used on CL, or other online outfitters. for example I bought a brand new older model Kelty coyote large Pack for about 100$ less then any newer model I would find at REI. I might review that outdoor outfitter later. Shoes are another thing you can purchase cheaper elsewhere.  So its worth shopping around if you see something you want here. I did buy my backpack stove, water filter (which again was on sale 20$ off),  and some cook ware here. Sometimes I need these items flash fast on payday and buying online isn't an option. Only one time were they out of stock of an item I wanted at this store location I thin it was running shoes. \n\nTip if you need a dressing room go to the shoe department and ask for help if nobody responds after the first bell ring.

"I was shocked to see so many good reviews.  \n\nSoooo disappointing.  Arrived on a Friday night a little before 9pm - it was so freaking loud.  We asked to sit on the restaurant side away from the band, but were told that we could not - they only had 1 server in this section - on a Friday night.  We were seated in the middle, the \""lounge\""  - I had to sit on a foot stool to eat my dinner - literally.  It was so uncomfortable.  I couldn't help but feel extremely rushed by our server. A guy in a suit - who I presume was a manager, seemed like a total douche.  One of the servers approached him with a problem and he said \""How many times are you going to make this mistake, it happened the last time we worked together.  Jesus, are you kidding me?!\""  Talk about embarrassing.\n\nThe food was ok - nothing that I was overly impressed with.  The \""Albondigas\"" - were meatballs from the freezer and the cheese on top tasted old. The \""Bravas\"" tasted like they might have been good around 6pm - but they sat in old grease for like 4 hours covered in paprika.   Maybe if they server would have waited to let us order more than 1 thing at a time instead of running away - we wouldn't have been there so long.  He came by and gave us \""last call\"" sometime around 10:30.  I understand that their hours are posted until 10 - but there were so many people still in the restaurant - and the band was still playing.

"This was my experience, my family of 5 and I were 1 minute late for our connecting flight. Our flight, coming from Philadelphia to Arizona, was 40 minutes late because the Philly incoming fly was late,  so leaving Philly, we were 30-45 min late.     The flight attendants in flight told us we would make our flight 'no problem,; and we all ran from A to B gates.    When we arrived to the gate, they had JUST shut the door. The plane was still parked. People from our SAME previous flight made it onto the plane before us and they had just gotten off the Philly flight just before us...

I also liked how she genuinely seemed excited to give me a new look.\nThe salon has a great atmosphere...I like how it is very upscale without being snobby. Everyone was very nice and they made you feel at home.\nThe aroma of their products is great too!\nI highly recommend this salon...you will not be disappointed.",150,4
"I picked up a few sweets for clients, and while the food looked good, the service was awful. When I went to pick up the order, they didn't even have paper plates, and I had to get my own napkins and forks. \n\nI thought this was a catered order since the woman taking the order (who was very rough around the edges by the way) made me pay in advance. Due to it's proximity, I tried ordering the next day, and the woman answering the phone was so rude, and told me I would have to call another location to place a phone order, even though I had just ordered from there yesterday! \n\nThis is too bad because my coworkers and I usually refer good bakeries etc., to each other across the country, but I will never refer this place.",171,2
"PROS: Good variety, simple but elegant decor, complementary silicon grips for hot plates, buffet area is is \""linear.\""\n\nCONS: Long waits during dinner/lunch rushes.\n\nWould recommend to guests looking for a buffet with variety while in Vegas that does not skimp on quality but can also endure long waits.\n\n-----\n\nMy favorite meal during my first trip to Vegas recently was definitely Bacchanal. My boyfriend and I went for brunch on Sunday at around 11PM and barely beat the lunch rush crowd. Between waiting to pay and be seated, it was about a 15 minute wait! This was great because my boyfriend had been here for dinner before and waited 2 hours! \n\nOnce in, I noticed that unlike a lot of buffets, the food area is like one big line you would go down instead of a bunched up area of food where people scatter into. I like this design better, as the line generally moves down in one direction and there is not that awkward bumping into people with hot plates (Which can safely be held because all guests are given little two-finger silicon grips for you to hold onto things that are left under heat lamps!). \n\nThe variety is beyond that of the other buffets along the strip, which is the big reason why I think people flock this place. The largest area is definitely the seafood section and guests seem to load up on the crab legs that are constantly being put out. I went during that transition from breakfast to lunch but this seems like more of a place for dinner, especially since the selection for dessert is exceptional. A lot of the items were more heavy, which is something I would prefer for a not-the-first-of-the-day meal. Great place to fix a hangover if one is so unfortunate!\n\nIf one MUST try the Caesar's buffet that everyone talks about, I would suggest going for early/late meals to avoid the crowds. It cuts the wait time and the employees are probably less on edge (The manager seemed short-fused with some of her employees while we awkwardly watched when waiting to be seated). \n\nI'm giving 4/5 stars because of that awkward instance and that because the breakfast/lunch/brunch items were heavier than preferred for 11AM on a Sunday.",487,3
"My wife and I recently visited since we live in the neighborhood. Both of us had visited before separately but it had been some time. \n\nMy main complaint boils down to lackluster service. We were looking for a semi-quick bite and to get on with our Sunday. We noticed the menu said that they had happy hour on Sunday so we ordered some adult beverages and appetizers. I then ordered a their Luau Pork Sandwich and my wife ordered the Pork Tacos from the happy hour menu (so we thought). \n\nWhen the bill came it was quite large. Turns out only drinks were on happy hour. I am sure there was something that noted that fact but it obviously was not obvious since we both did not know this. In my opinion the server should have done a better job explaining the menu and happy hour deals instead of walking up and saying, \""Can I get you something to drink?\"" I'm not looking for a line-by-line explanation of the menu but perhaps a quick overview of what is going on inside the 4-walls; especially when we order some things that any other day would be on happy hour. The server really just didn't seem to want to be there.\n\nNothing was horrendous about Hula's I just left feeling a bit bamboozled. Probably won't be back.",278,1
"After my friend took me to a pho restaurant in Mesa, I was wanted to find a place closer to where I live.  Their pho at 43rd express was ok, but they didn't have tofu pho for veg heads or a variety of teas. Oh, and a heads up, it's cash only!",68,1

"Hmm Texas de Brazil or Fogo? That was the question on my brain yesterday morning and I couldn't decide so like a fatty I went to Fogo for lunch and Texas for dinner. Fogo is good but between the two it is definitely a toss up. Fogo has the better decor,, service was 5 stars and very attentive, good wine selection, and for some reason I liked their thick forks....i know weird. But anyway, its all about the food and I think Fogo's salad bar is amazing and has way more vegetables than Texas and their asparagus stalks are huge. They also have a good selection of cheeses and cold cuts as well but I didn't notice any hot dishes (maybe because it was lunch). Texas on the other hand had more choices of hot side dishes which is nice but I would much rather have more of a selection of vegetables.  \n\nI do have to say I liked Texas meat better than Fogos. The bacon wrapped chicken at Texas is damn good but for some reason the chicken and some of the sirloins at Fogos were extremely dry. I didn't even want to finish the rest of my bacon wrapped chicken because it was that dry and I mean damn how are you gonna mess up something with bacon on it? (noticed i said \""didn't want to\"" oh i still ate it tho ...but begrudgingly) But the rest of the meat: the lamb, the house meat Picanha and the bacon wrapped sirloin, da-yamn! Yeah I'll be back.",321,3
"The signage to find the restaurant is a bit lacking but after I was able to make my way in the decor is wonderful.  the view is ok if you like looking at the old part of the southern end of the the strip.  The service was good, never hurried but the food was average at best.  I had the full tasting menu which consists of more than 6 plates.  That may have been part of the problem, there was no focus.  I love tasting menus because you get to try different items but when two thirds of the plates are bland, it wasn't worth the price.  Too many great restaurants in Vegas to spend this kind of money.",139,0
"Went there expecting another back room table place. NOT the case. Was extremely amazed how just one lady can cook, run the meat counter, ring up customers in the front, take orders and serve food and still remain delightful. If you are understanding of the culture you know that time is unimportant, the food is why your there. I asked for a usual Moroccan drink and the owner brought out a unique beverage that i can only say you have to try just to try it. At the end of a fantastic meal I again  asked what a usual dessert is and she came out with a wonderful seminola flour pastry with her own homemade cream filling bathed in honey, WOW!\nMaking a list of friends to bring there, cant' wait to go back.",152,4
"Although the place is under new management now, I recall coming to this place when it was Pat Thai and not feeling like it stood out. It still really doesn't to me. I had the chicken cashew and chicken satay. Both were legit, but I'm not over the moon about it. The chicken cashew didn't have very good quality chicken and was packed full of veggies that I don't care for. Baby corns. Who eats baby corns? Not my fave, but I have to give them props on the thai tea. It was legit.",118,2

"2.5 Stars\n\nIt's not the best nor the worst I've had.  Mi Tierra(MT) is just a polished up Sainz Mexican Restaurant which was the previously name.  Almost all the same crew and meals.  They did not even bother changing the names on the menus or POS system.  \n\nMy family and I decided to try MT because we assumed it was a new establishment with a fresh menu.  We soon figured out we were in for a familiar experience when the menus were handed to us.  Note to ownership, you are in desperate need of a real wait staff to provide a better experience!  Do not brew your ice tea in your coffee machine, it does not taste good!\n\nOur table had the following items....\n\nCaldo de Rez $6.99:  very average and skimpy with the Rez(beef).\n\nRolled Taquitos w/ guacamole $5.99: at least they were not from the freezer...very average and nothing to brag about!\n\nGreen Cheese Enchiladas w/ sour cream $7.99: the green sauce has a very good flavor with a hint of spice.  The beans were fresh and had a good taste, but the cook went heavy with the black pepper in the rice today!\n\nRed Cheese Enchiladas $7.99: the red sauce was average...rice and beans were the same as the above item.  \n\nMexican food is very subjective!  I can honestly tell you that I have been to many Mexican restaurants in the valley and you can find better than MT.  Tip to my fellow Yelpers, look for more experienced Yelpers to give you an idea of a place is good or not.  I do not take reviewers with single digit reviews too seriously.",387,1

"This Walmart blew the opportunity to redeem the repeated failure of a product, for which I did not happen to have the receipt when I decided to stop and take care of it. Customer Service Manager Chelsea is clearly empowered to read the return policy on the wall. Of course, I am, too. The purpose of requesting to speak to a manager was to gain the exception that those in such a position are typically able to dispense. \n\nMy request? Please allow me to upgrade to a higher quality item since the original lasted less than a month and the first replacement only a week. We are talking $12.88 here. She suggested that I go to a larger store that has different parameters for returns. I suggested that I shop at Target. Customer Service Manager Chelsea was good with that.",163,0
"I'm so glad and excited that we have a seafood joint here in AZ just like boiling crab, we don't have to drive to Cali just to get our boiling crab fix. The place is huge it has a lot of tables. I like how they have picnic tables outside for the people waiting when the place gets packed. Service was good, our server (Austin) was very patient and accommodating. We ordered 2lbs of shrimp, trifecta, no spice but when it got to our table, I changed my mind and i wanted to add spice to it, he was very nice to exchange it and was not bothered. Then, when it came to our table the second time, i felt the bag is cold and we tried the shrimp, it was a little under cooked, we have to return it again so they can cook it more. I appreciated all he has done for our great dining experience. Everything tasted just like boiling crab, in fact! the sauce is not too salty compared to boiling crab and they have better crispier fresh Cajun fries! I Love it! My mom was excited to hear about this place! I will bring her here on her birthday.",238,3
"I had never been to a Benihana before today, but upon hearing of their off the charts happy hour, we decided it to be a good time to try.\n\nWell, the prices are amazing. 3.75 for just about every roll, 1.25 for eel nigiri, and 3 bucks for shishito peppers. They have a pleasant list of specialty drinks for five dollars each as well! I'm stoked now and ready to get my drink on and tear up some sushi.\n\nWell, the sushi offerings were on the verge if being inedible. I'm not completely convinced that the seafood was the freshest in town at this moment, and the tempura on some of the rolls was nothing but flour and water and impossibly chewy. Nasty!\n\nI will say one thing though, the shishito peppers were frigging amazing. Hence the  extra star, I will go back for those and some five buck hooch.",205,1
"This is not Cirque du Soleil's best offering.\n\nThe circus acts were average, the music was forgettable and deafeningly loud, the costumes and set were nothing special, and the comedic elements always fell flat. It felt like a Myst\u00e8re wannabe that had a series of very disjointed performances.\n\nI really wanted to like this show since it felt like Cirque was going back to its roots, but I was unimpressed and kept dozing off. It was painful seeing the clowns perform really un-funny skits that got lukewarm reactions from the crowd.\n\nThis show is in serious need of tweaking, especially given the ticket prices! Thank goodness my family and I didn't pay full price.",157,1
"The Luxor of 2013 is less lush than the Luxor of 2004, but it's still a nice property. I was not expecting Wynn or The Four Seasons when I made a last minute reservation; if you're looking for five star treatment pull out the platinum Amex or drop a few grand on the felt; if you're looking for a clean reasonable room for a last minute jaunt, step inside. For sleep, quiet and a hot shower, the Luxor fit my needs. No in-room wifi? This is the age of the the smartphone and my LTE was brilliant in my pyramid room. Hit any of the casino floors in walking distance and there's free wifi galore; if you don't want to pay for porn, download it before you come. Staff were friendly, the room is clean & the water is hot. \nThe queue at the check-in was my only rant; either have extra staff on hand for peak periods or give me some distraction while I wait ( you have a great foyer, why not some live music, a California greeting or a candy cane compliments of the hotel to contemplate while I wait..?)\nNext year it might be the Bellagio, but this holiday at the Luxor is off to a great start.",264,2
"The food was ok.  \nThey had available tables, and that was the major draw here.  The place was upstairs and out of view.  I didn't read about it before going and didn't know what to expect.\nThey didn't have as great of a selection on the 'brazillian' menu as some places.  The meat was decent.   The sides with the meal were adequate.  It was a fair amount of money to spend for a meal.  I'd say that you should be hungry if you go to get your money's worth.  I've been to better brazillian steakhouses.  This was ok, but nothing special.",145,1
"We returned to this Moe's after about a two-year gap.  Why?  Last time we had been there, we had such an awful experience that I wrote to the manager.  He sent me gift certificates to use at another time at that location.  \n\nI think the reason for my complaint before was all about poor customer service and restaurant cleanliness.  From our recent experience last night, I see that in the two years that I haven't visited, nothing has changed.  \n\nI'm surprised this Moe's stays in business.  First, it's hidden behind a staircase in the strip mall it's in, creating a dungeon-like atmosphere.  Second, it's very narrow, not allowing for much walk space.  And since last night happened to be Kids Eat Free night (a coincidence), it was super-crowded with families and a balloon clown that blocked the only narrow walkway with the throng of kids around him. Getting through over-active kids crowding the tiny walkway to outdoor seating without spilling my salsa was a mighty challenge. \n\nOrdering toppings for your food is always a treat.   The job seems so routine to the food assemblers that they barely pay attention to you and you have to repeat yourself several times.   They screwed up two of the kids' orders because they weren't listening and just hurrying along adding whatever they wanted that they had to start again from scratch.  And then, upon sitting down, we realized that they STILL ended up screwing up the orders.  How hard is it to put tomatoes on one taco and cheese on another?  My burrito came out pretty good, though, because I was meticulous about focusing on what they weren't focusing on.  \n\nThe cashier rang us up:  a burrito, a salad, a bowl, and two kids meals.  The kids meals were free, so I guess the total came to $22 or so.  We handed them $20 in gift certificates, intending to pay the rest in cash.  Apparently, the task was too difficult for the cashier.  Too many things going on.  The cashier took the gift certificates and told us that we were all set.  He probably voided the order.  I wonder how the restaurant makes any money at all.  \n\nCleanliness?  The salsa bar and drink stand was a mess, but thankfully the salsa containers were all full.  What few tables were open needed to be cleaned.  And there was a giant water spill/puddle in the ordering line.  Certainly a safety hazard.  \n\nWill we go back?  Heck no.  If I want Moe's, there are too many better locations in town.  Better yet, I'll head to Chipotle or Qdoba.\n\np.s. Regarding the \""Welcome to Moe's!\"" thing.  Stop it.  It's annoying, and if the employees are going to do it with little to no enthusiasm because it's so routine to them, don't even bother.",646,1
"The prices are low but if you look up \""operational excellence\"" in the dictionary it will say \""definition = not floor and decor\"".   This is the Frys electronics of flooring.  \""If its in stock they've got it!\""  My goodness they can screw up post toasties. I called to see if they had some more to finish off a job we were working on.  I had everything - SKU numbers, the bar codes same thing on the Tmoulding and quarter round.  I called first to ask if they could check on inventory before I got there so I did not waste time driving out for nothing.  I should have just driven there because they answered the phone and when I asked if they had it Jessica takes the numbers down and puts me on hold.  Well I could have driven because they put me on hold and... I donno smoked a cigarette - went on break.. Im half way to the store by now and they say yes we have all of them.  In a normally well run place they type it in the computer and they can tell you in 1 min if they have it or not.  So she comes back on the line (on hold I get the how wonderful we are blather on hold one of the services is they will hold your order for pickup- now remember this for later).  I tell Jessica great - I need this much get it ready I will be there in 10 min.  Oh no no no... we cant do that.  Unless you have your credit card on file.  Well Jessica, I have bought from you before so look it up.  You will have to buy it... OK Jessica I want to buy it and Im on the way to pick it up.... no no we cant do that - for liability, your security, safety - to save the whales and dolphins whatever we just cant, dont wont...no no no.. So apparently common sense tips Jessica over so she transfers me to a manager - he tells me the same thing.  So I say OK whatever Im about to pull into the parking lot anyway now that we wasted all that time.    You guessed it I walk in and we start all over from square 1 - Jessica does not remember talking to me, nobody knows which manager I spoke with.  I give them the BAR CODES and SKU numbers from everything I want and the desk staff goes into brain freeze - well whats your phone number?  Really you cant tell me if you have stock on that stuff even though you just confirmed you did on the phone but of course if you had done what I suggested I would be paying for it now and on my way out the door... long story short I wasted 45 min with them running all over and getting this and that while being interrupted for one thing or another and finally got it paid for and on my way... There was one box that looked damaged and it had been opened so I insisted that they replace it because I just did not want to deal with Bevis and Butt-head again.  Its a sweat shop to work at and I imagine some distant management has created some idiot rules that they have to follow (or hide behind) so as not to give good service - they might not be able to if they wanted to.  The prices are low but they make absolutely no sense and its inefficient beyond belief and chaos and disorganization galore.  This explains why there is a tile and flooring store on every street corner in the Phoenix area... its a hot mess but low prices.  Thankfully I dont have to shop for this stuff often or I would send someone else to arm wrestle with them.",743,2

"Meh? The only thing truly worth the hype at this restaurant is the view of the Bellagio fountains. We got to see the show every 20 minutes as we sat on the outside patio under some heat lamps.\n\nWe got a steak and a pear salad, and it was decent but quite pricey. For example, the salad was slightly over $10 and for that price I would've expected a large salad that could actually serve as a meal. Instead, it was more like a side dish. I think some mention large portions, but this is not true at all. The steak dish did come on a large plate, but 75% of the dish was filled with frites, a ton of tiny little thin cut and crispy fries. Not really my favorite kind, especially in that quantity.\n\nThis is a fancy yet affordable place for business meetings and group get-togethers, but make sure you get a reservation if coming during a busy season like CES. There is also still a line for reservations, but it's much better than waiting in the non-reservation line.\n\nI probably wouldn't come here again as I could just watch the fountain show for free and with an even better view, and the food is not worth returning for.",264,2

Apple stores today induce anxiety. I prefer the old-school checkout register with a line. Their prices are high for poorly made products with too-short warranties that seem to expire just before your computer crashes or a cable is snapped.

Now, I know to choose on the higher end of the scale. \n\nThe pad thai had a mix of tofu and chicken. It had a heavy amount of red onion. It could've used more peanuts, and I prefer the crunch of fresh bean sprouts these were softened from being mixed into the noodles.\n\nService was great. Atmosphere is real nice.

Unfortunately the price is the best thing here. I loveeee sushi and when I heard this place was $14.99 for lunch I had to check it out. Stopped here for lunch today with my sister and her friend. I did not like the server she was just blah. No personality at all. She barely said 2 words to us the whole time we were there. She never even said your welcome after we thanked her for bringing water or our food. To me that is just rude. Servers seem to forget their performance affects their tip... so if they act shitty they can expect the tip will be as well. \n\nSo they don't have the best quality of fish but it is decent. We tried these rolls:\nCali in Vegas \nHawaiian\nSalmon lover \nImperial \nOrange \nSticky icky\nMaui\nMexican which was never received \n\nMost of the rolls fell apart which is annoying. I don't want to have to use a fork while eating sushi ya feel me? And none of the rolls were great they were all just Ok. The ponzu sauce on the Hawaiian roll tasted like straight vinegar it was pretty bad. Also after reading the reviews today I found out they have dessert. It wasn't on the menu and you can bet our sparkling personality server didn't mention it. Never again.,284,1

Friend went to car to get our wallets and apparently the owner had arrived and was now patrolling their EMPTY parking lot like a junkyard dog.  She asked friend if she was watching the parade, which she obviously was not, insisting to her and me  that we had to move the car. Needless to say, we moved the car...on down the road. I noticed the many other reviews on here describing the owner as rude and couldn't agree more. For a delightful shopping experience, continue on west on Cave Creek Rd. a mile or so to Valerie's, who's really nice and  carries beautiful locally made merchandise.",165,0
"I was waiting for a friend to finish up at Patty's Closet nearby and was playing around on the Yelp App when I saw that Sugar Bee's Bakery has a check in deal: one free item with purchase.  It said .1 miles away and had 4.5 stars, so I was like we gotta try it!  We were greeted right when we walked in.  She let us know that their display cases were down so there was more items in the back.  I wish I got her name but she was really nice and chatted with us the whole time.  They did have some items in the case the ham and cheese croissant was flirting with me.  We ended up getting 3 macaroons.  One each of the 3 flavors they had that day blackberry, french vanilla, strawberry lemonade and a Perrier.  The total was $4.00.  We even asked her...are you sure?  I think you missed something.  But that was the total.  There isn't anywhere to sit down, more of a take out place.  We ended up talking to the woman (co-owner? pastry chef?) helping us and eating our macaroons at the counter.  They were awesome.  Even the french vanilla which sometimes can be plain was really good.  She said they are going to have a lot of new items for Valentines Day so if you are in the area be sure to stop in and check those out.",304,3
"I have to remind myself that this is bar and I am rating bar food. So I kinda feel silly because it is bar food, so maybe I shouldn't be so harsh? I came primarily to try the poutine fries, but of course also ordered a pizza. We placed our poutine fry order, and it took 30 minutes for them to come out, it was a small order and we were the only people in the dining area. Our server was always coming around checking on us, so I know it wasn't her fault for the delay, so we couldn't really figure it out. Was a little strange to get your app at the same time as the meal. As for the pizza, it is Sicilian style (rectangular) which I'm not a huge fan of because I like crust, so you have an entire mid section of pizza that is all alone because I eat around it. We ordered half margherita and half back home. When the pizza came out it looked good, but as I got a couple bites in, it started to taste gross. They bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of putting it on after, so the basil is wilted and burnt, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese was gross to look at after 15 minutes, it became hard and formed, and the crust had an overwhelming taste of yeast, clearly not quality ingredients. Again, I realize I'm at a bar. My stomach has been a little upset since I ate. The two things this place has going for them is the Pandora station they play and the poutine fries, but I'd never come back and wait 30 minutes for them.",344,0
"I have been here a couple times and liked the place and the menu.\n\nBut recently Sapna offered a Groupon, of which I bought two, and soon after she closed! I heard she was having a tough time keeping afloat and maybe this was a last minute attempt to bring in traffic, but what the heck! it was valid from Nov 21 till May 21 and I haven't used even one. \n\nThis is just pure... nonsense!",101,0
"The building is beautiful, the bathrooms are clean (and modern feeling with a shared washroom) and the patio is pretty cool.  I liked sitting at the bar AND being outside so that's a total plus for me.  Great Tequila selection (DUH) and the bartender made me one of THE best margaritas I have ever had outside of my own house.  They were out of agave nectar so he used citrus flower water (I don't really know that that is either) but it rocked so I'll definitely be back for that again.  Although we didn't eat, the menu looked rather run-of-the-mill-Tex-Mex-bar-food.  There isn't anything wrong with that but I am sure a creative mind in the kitchen could kick it up a couple notches.  Their check-in deal was pretty cool too.  I wasn't all that crowded for a Monday night at all but even with that - service was standard - no real conversation or personality but we got what we needed.\n\nOverall, I'd tell you to check this place out.  It's worth the visit even if it is just once.",246,2
"I was initially happy with Cruise America when I first looked them up and made a reservation (almost two months in advance of when I needed the RV).  This premature assessment quickly degraded as time neared for me to pick up my rental.  I had gone out of my way to ensure everything was ready to go when they had informed me just a mere couple of days before that there would be an additional deposit and I had to fax additional forms.  I had asked multiple times ahead of time if there was ANYTHING else, but was assured there wasn't going to be.  I stepped up and provided what was needed...and hoped that would be the only bump in the road (so-to-speak).\n\nTime comes to pick up the RV...my friend and I are about 20 minutes early and I have all of my documentation in order.  The pickup process at the actual rental facility in San Fernando was a nightmare.  So many mistakes were made.  We were nearly not allowed to pick up the rental because of errors made on the part of those working there.  One of the errors they made was they ran my card for the balance owed but had exited the contract prior to it posting in the computer system.  When they opened the reservation back up (on the computer), there was still an amount due for $800+.  They asked to swipe my card again, but I told them they already charged it.  They insisted and, obviously, it didn't go through.  They told me that I can't pick it up until I pay the balance owed.  I spent hours on the phone with my bank, their  offices and with friends (that were waiting to load up the RV).  After they looked into my assertions (about my card already being charged), they realized that I was correct in that my card was, in fact, charged.  By the time they finally got it corrected (thanks to Lee Kindernay and an IT administrator from the corporate offices), it was almost 3 hours later.  We got to the place to begin loading up the RV and saw that the hitch lock was still on (we needed the hitch to attach the bike rack to).  I called the rental facility in San Fernando and they said \""oops, I forgot...bring it back up and we'll take care of it\"".  A few more gallons of gas, additional mileage, and time wasted, we were FINALLY ready to load up the RV.  We had planned to leave by 5:30pm...that turned into 10pm because of this whole disaster.  Driving through the night was not pleasant and required ridiculous amounts of caffeine.\n\nWe get to our destination just fine and the RV seems to be just fine as well.  The next day, I go to use the shower and find that it doesn't work.  One of the big reasons why I wanted to camp with an RV is because it has a shower.  I was told when I picked it up that everything was in working order by the rental facility.\n\nUpon return of the RV, the process was no less stressful.  The same people that seemed to lack ANY customer service skills were there putting me through similar headaches as when we picked up the RV.  Out of $1,000 security deposit (ridiculous, huh!?), I got a couple hundred back.  Considering I paid to have the RV professionally cleaned and didn't damage anything, that's pretty bad.\n\nI called Cruise America a couple of times about these issues.  I wrote them some emails.  I even sent a letter.  To date, NOTHING has been resolved.  They didn't even try sending an apology form letter with a partial refund.  I've submitted an official complaint to the Better Business Bureau and have posted numerous bad reviews.  They don't seem to care.  It is nearing the verge of making this a legal matter.  It is absurd how little they care.  Had they just apologized and refunded me a little bit of the $2,500 (roughly) that I spent, then I would have been content in rating them with 3 stars.  It's their lack of care that gets them just 1, which, in fact, is still being generous!",897,0
"I've had a very positive experience here and wanted to share:\n\nI am coming up on my one year at La Estancia. When I was looking I went to a ton of places and stuck with La Estancia and haven't regretted it.\nLocation- great location, close to Fresh and Easy and albertsons, the park, golf course, canal trail, and a quick drive to shopping/freeways. It's tucked away off the main road so it is quiet and across from a police station making it feel even safer.\nOther Tenants- all my neighbors have been friendly and reasonably quiet. A lot of kids live here but I wouldn't know it if I didn't go to work the same time the school bus comes. They are so quiet! No loud parties since I've been here either.\nOutside- recently the painting was redone and it looks good. There are covered spots for tenants and guest parking too. I have never had an issue finding parking for our second car in our lot. There are a couple pools, a tennis court, and plenty of trees. \nInside- I live in a one bedroom. It is an open floor plan with plenty of space! The closet in the bedroom is amazing. I wish I had enough stuff to fill it. The kitchen has a large pantry and lots of storage space. Every place I look at now looks so small because it is very open and the rooms are big. The appliances aren't bad. Sometimes my dishwasher gets stuck but I don't use it much so I've never asked to get it fixed. The washer and dryer are newer and I've never had any issues. I've seen some of the re-done units and they look great too! Mine isn't one of the most recently updated ones and it is still perfect. There are two ceiling fans which is nice because I don have to use my AC as much.\nStaff- the first time I came to the office after my visit I was shocked the women remembered me! They were nice, friendly and made me feel valued. I ask a lot of questions and know I can be a pest but they are always helpful. I usually go into the office right as they are closing too because of my work hours but they are still kind and help me. I've never needed to call maintenance but each time something has been redone or painted I got a notice well in advance. A couple times the water has had to get shut off but there is always significant notice on that too.\nCost- I pay a little over $700 before utilities. It was more reasonable, bigger, and felt safer than all the other $700+ places I looked at.\nDownsides- I don't have much to say. I'm lazy so I wish there was a dumpster closer to my apartment. Where they have them makes sense though so you can't smell them. The gym is small and I've never got to use it because it is only open when the office is, conveniently my work hours. However, I don't think it was like that until someone abused the privilege. There are gyms nearby and the canal/park literally right next to it though so there are other workout options. A bunch of little beetles kept crawling through a crack somewhere in my kitchen during the fall. No harm though and it didn't last long. No roaches or scorpions ever spotted.",714,3
"My wife and I really like this place.  Lots of great bargains on higher end merchandise, clothing and shoes.  It's kind of hit and miss depending on the season and their fast moving inventory. Not always a wide range of sizes and colors.  The people who work here are very friendly and helpful.   They also instituted a great remote check out service which eliminates the need to stand and wait in a long line.   This store is located in a really good shopping center with lots of other great stores and restaurants.  Returns and exchanges have always been easy and quick.",119,3

I had the BBQ ribs with mashed potatoes & steamed broccoli & the hubby had Panko fish & chips. I liked that they offered free range grass fed burgers, organic pilaf options along with being able to order some dishes with less sodium/sugar/carbs. The inside is cozy & pub like; I look forward to sitting on the patio in the coming months...",131,3
"had to go in and try the pie..\n\ngiving it 3 stars, and not because it was bad or anything was wrong with it.  It was very good.  But if it was back in NYC it would just be another average pizza place.  I know that sounds like a backhanded compliment, but it isnt.  This place is legit, especially for out here.\n\nreally glad this place opened as I think the more legit east coast pizza places around here the better.  This is most like Joe's NY pizza in scottsdale and  It reminds me alot of slices of pie you get on the Jersey Shore.  Obviously made by the same people who have made pizza back home in years past.\n\nHad the onion and tomato pie and I liked it.",166,2
"This property management company is the absolute worst I have ever dealt with in over 18 years in Las Vegas!\n\nThe apartment complex I was renting from (and currently escaping from) is Bay shore Club. The place is a disgusting nightmare hole in the wall, being run by the most unprofessional woman in Las Vegas. I have called to the management company several times over the course of my lease to report the unprofessional level of interactions, and to this day (over 8 months) Not One person from this company has ever bothered to pick up a phone to call back, or even acknowledge that I have been attempting to contact them.\n\n Now I understand that this is common for this company, as they don't actually care whether or not their employees treat the residents with courteousness or respect, because they don't treat their residents with respect either! How hard would it be to return ONE phone call in 8 months? Is it actually possible that the people in this company are really NEVER at their desks, and I ALWAYS get to leave a voice mail? No, they just don't want to be bothered, and therefore do not deal with legitimate complaints either!\n\nThe following is a list of  properties owned and operated by this company, and I strongly suggest you find a different management company to rent from.\n\n Avalon at Seven Hills  Cha Cha Cha Copper Hills  Sunset Hills  Amber Ridge  Arville Park Apartments Bayshore Club  Bella Estates Bolero (Viking Villas) Bonanza Storage  Bossa Nova  Bossa Nova Storage Boulevard Park  Cabana Park  Canyon Creek Villas  Canyon Pointe   Century Village  Coronado Bay Club Cottonwood Creek  Cypress Springs Apartments  Echelon at Centennial Hills  El Pueblo De Las Brisas Flamingo Chateau  Meadow Ridge  Newport Cove  East Palm Hills  Paradise Square  Pecos Terrace Pinehurst Luxury Apartments  Regency Heights  Rosewood Park  Sandpointe  Saratoga Palms  Siena Townhomes (Shepherd Hills)  Skyline Terrace (Villa Marienda)  Spanish Oaks  St. Clair Apartments  St. Tropez Apartments  Summerhill Villas  Sunstone Mini Storage Swenson  The Commons at Seven Palms  The Park Vista Apartments  The Rancho Vista  The Villa Del Rio  The Villa Del Sol  Tierra Villas  Woodlake Villas  Wynn Palms  Parkwood Apartments",485,0

I also brought a cute Wine book for pairing that I presented to her as well\n\nOverall a great place in Baxter Village that I plan to take my friends to this summer around my birthday.

"Not the finest cuisine in the world, but not bad at all.  Especially if you're looking for a quick bite.\n\nThere is a multitude of fine dining options at Aria Las Vegas Resort & Casino, but sometimes you just want a burger, ya know?  Cafe Vettro is the answer.  It's a beautiful space with towering floor to ceiling windows facing the front entrance of the hotel with amazing amounts of natural light.  I believe they recently installed shades for the windows because it used to be like dining while staring at the sun.  Not fun.\n\nYou'll find the typical menu items here:  burgers, salads, sandwiches, fried calamari and steaks.

I was last here on Christmas Day and I expected uber stink face, but they were still pleasant!

After that failed, he tried to blame the receptionist who tried at least 3 times to call his office, twice on his cell phone, and even sent him and E-mail!

"Like most casino clubs, walk around looking good and someone will come up to you and ask you to fill their establishments.  We got suckered into this place after watching Criss Angel, see my Yelp! review on that.  A nice gentleman in a black suit approached us and asked if we'd check out the club.  He skipped us past the lines and velvet ropes, no clue if there was an entrance fee, and just moseyed on up the spiral staircase (take the elevator to the second floor, if you're lazy).\n\nOnce atop, you are greeted by what I call a Cleopatra-esque chase.  It's got a spotlight on it and just screams \""Come!  Take a cheesey Vegas club picture on me.\""  Afterwhich, there are two rooms with a long bar in each.  You have to go through the first room to enter the second.  The earlier of which is slightly more subdue and... well, empty.

There was a photobooth in an almost hidden niche. .. but, seriously, $10?!

"I liked my seafood risotto and I liked how they added a lot of seafood to my dish, but the texture of the rice was a little raw for me. They still have some sort of a crunch to them. I like my risotto a bit more creamy, the perfect rice texture for me would be when it's not too chewy but still have a little bounce to each grain. It's kind of hard to describe rice, okay?\n\nServer is nice, fills up our water whenever he sees necessary. We got seated on the \""outside\"" area which is outside of the dining room, but still inside the casino. I felt like either the manager or the owner of the restaurant was a little rude.

We were literally only about 3 steps away and it never occurred to him that we are paying customers too and a \""how's the food?\"" would make us feel a little invisible from him. Two other tables around us also got the missing attention so shame on him for being selective-people pleaser.\n\nThe bill came out to be a little bit on the costly side when I didn't feel like the quality was worth it. I've had paid for fraction of the cost for something better. Although, if you go over to the box office, they have a 20% off coupon for you to use.

"In need of a cold sweet 'adult' treat upon our arrival into Vegas we ended up at the Sugar Factory. We ordered the Reese's Martini and the Sexual Chocolate cocktail. I liked that the rim of the Reese's Martini was lined with peanut butter, but I wish they would of then rolled it in Reese's crumbs. That would of taken this drink to the next level of deliciousness. I was pleasantly surprised by the Sexual Chocolate cocktail, it was richer and creamier than I expected. We're these drinks by themselves worth $14 a piece? No, but the atmosphere right on the Strip, helped to stomach the price. \n\nNow the thing that isn't worth the price is their water policy. They don't serve tap water.

Stay away from this place!!!! I've just moved into Henderson and was in the hunt for a sectional sofa. We found one and we paid with a debt card and they said it would be in a week from that day. It took a month! I would call them and they would just give me the run around. I do not know how these people stay in business. Then when they delivered it. It was in a box? And the driver said that I had to pay him 65 for the set up fee. I said no one said anything about that! He should a copy of the invoice and some one had forged my initials on the little box on the invoice that said i did not wanted set up. I said look at mine there's no check on my box. So I called the store and they said that he would set it up for free. It took them 3 hrs to set it up and they did not have the proper tools for the set up they had to go buy parts at Home Depot. The Sofa is not comfortable at all. They buy this things in china for a fraction of the price and stick it too everyone. I gave the Sofa away and went to Macys they Guarantee if you don't like you can surely get your money back no problem.,264,0
"My biggest complaint is that they are not open on Monday.  Seems I always crave the sol on mondays.  They have an excellent selection of combos to choose from.  Quick service, limited dining area.  El Sol is owned by the same family that owns El Zocalo down the street.  Same great food, slightly cheaper pricing and quicker service.  Truly a treat.  Their baked goods are too die for as well.",91,3
"It was hard to give this place 2 stars as the food was DELICIOUS!  The location is awesome and we had a great table by the window.  The view is great.  The service was horrible.  They were having some computer problems.  It would have been great if the server came and explained that to us, instead he just disappeared and I guess was trying to fix it.  I am not a needy diner by any means, however, our wine glasses were empty for a while (which we spent $70 per glass for), we would have ordered dessert but it just took too long.  It was almost like we were forgotten.  Spending almost $300 for 2 people should get you AMAZING service.",153,1
"While being bombarded in this lone desert outpost by countless pizza joints and fast food establishments, a gem shows up from time to time.  This is one of them.  King Fish is independently owned and that's what Maricopa needs more of.  A lot more.  \n\nMy first order from King Fish was simple.  Fried catfish and okra.  Didn't disappoint at all.  In fact, I'm pretty stoked that restaurant food this good actually exists so near to where I live!  The catfish was light, cornmeal battered and fried with perfection.  The okra was fried and just as tasty.  I originally ordered red beans and rice as my side but they were out.  They just opened this past week so I'm sure there are going to be more growing pains, but they're off to a good start.  \n\nOn the menu they have chicken, snapper, Tilapia, shrimp and oysters.  I can't wait to sample all of this!",212,3
"Three of us ate here around noon. The food is still hanging around my stomach at 4PM. Not a good sign. \n\nThe decor is a cross between a cheap office building and a cheap restaurant. I would have forgiven the terrible interior, if the food would have been anything else but what it had. \n\nThe food, my friends, was a cross between airport food, bad diner food, and play dough. Ok, the play dough was an exaggeration, but it was crappy to say the least. \n\nThe french toast was small, substandard, and boring. The eggs were average. The hash browns were crispy on the outside, but mushy on the inside. They also came with a nice size imprint of half our servers hand (Yummy-yumsters!!!) \n\nThe biscuits were alright. I guess the worst thing about eating here, besides the food, was the feeling that no one truly wanted to be there. The servers or the customers. Why isn't there a really good place for breakfast in such a big city? No matter where I go, I am not blown away at all. Sad really.",239,0
"The owner and staff are all friendly. Their bread are freshly made every day. The first time my husband and I came, everything tasted fantastic.

Maybe I will try ordering something else besides the sandwich next time.",78,2
"I hate hate writing a bad review, but after my second bad interaction with Pep boys, I feel like its necessary. \n\nSo I went in to get my headlight lamp replaced. I told them the lights I wanted, they said ok, $62 includes parts and labor. Cool I said do it. A couple mins later the kid, comes by and said oh I am sorry I quoted you incorrectly its going to be $89, and then gave a long explanation of why and I said ok. Then some sort of manager guy comes out and he wants me to go to the service desk. I go over and he says because the make of you car, and how difficult the headlight repair is for these, its going to be $92 per headlight. We have to disassemble your entire headlight assembly and replace the bulbs. He laid out this really convincing story that it would be a really long job. Well I happen to know how to replace the headlights because I had replaced my turn signal bulbs after they messed it up in the first place. I asked why take apart the headlights? When there a cover in the wheel well, that you pop out and take the bulb in/out. He goes oh there is? And we go out to look and the guy had already popped it out and starting taking it out that way. \n\nSo imagine if I hadnt had that knowledge of what the job encompassed then I would of been like ok $92 each is cool. And way over spent of this repair. Very very sad to have encountered this experience here. As women we already are scared of getting ripped off by mechanics!\n\nIn the shop they have a sales number goals, total goals for each department.. Well word of advice, worry more about your customer experience, and you wont have to worry about your sales. Providing a great customer experience, will bring repeat customers, and referrals. \n\nI will never ever step foot in the shop again.",405,0
"I've given this place 2 tries, and while it is ok, I probably won't be back. The first time we tried the margherita on cracker crust, which was a little low on flavor but fresh tasting so ok, and the rosemary potato pizza. The potatoes were not cooked enough, making the top a soft potato mess. Not enough salt and pepper could fix what was lacking. \n\nToday we got the Revolution (sort of an everything pizza) and a make your own (caramelized garlic, jalape\u00f1os, goat cheese). The Revolution comes with a Parmesan garlic sauce drizzled over the top which you don't see until you pick up a slice and there is a puddle of oil on your plate, sogging up the crust. The garlic/jalape\u00f1o/goat cheese pizza was better. \n\nI should have noticed from the other yelp photos, but revolution leaves a lot of crust around the edges free of sauce/toppings/cheese. It's a bummer.",223,1
"Thai House is one of my favorite Thai places ever. Their Panang curry is second to none, and is the reason why I fell in love with Kaffir lime leaves as a seasoning. The Pad Thai, which is of course the standard dish by which to judge any Thai restaurant, is just right; not too sweet, not too salty, not too fishy. The chicken satay is always moist and creamy,  and the soups are delicious too. It's always a tossup between the creamy tom kha and the hot and sour shrimp soup.  \n\nNow, I'm not saying Thai House is perfect. We've been coming here since they first opened years ago, and have watched their service consistently improve. Service is now friendly and fast, which several years ago it was not. It can still be a little spotty - for example, on our last visit, the server forgot our beverages until well after the entrees arrived - but it is always earnest. And spicy food lovers, beware: on their scale of 1-5, I always order a 6, and usually it comes out about a 2. (Of course they have a chili paste you can add at the table, but I find it too acidic; it changes the flavor of the dish too much.)   It can get a little tight in their small space, but it's well worth it for the food. And at these prices (less than $8 for a large dinner portion of the curries), Thai House will continue to get my business for many years to come.",323,3
If you like craft beer and better than average bar food then this place is perfect!\n\nIt's on the second level of the building and you can see Camelback Mountain from the bar and front patio.\n\nThe service is great and all the employees really know about craft beer.  I had a Racer X IPA that I had never tried before and it was wonderful.  I also had a rich and creamy Avery Czar Imperial Stout that was awesome.\n\nThe Ivan burger is as good as the hype.  They also double fry their french fries to make them extra crispy the way I like them!\n\nThe Attic really does a great job and I can't wait to come back soon.,149,4

So I did.\n\nIt comes out like a lava of cheese and pasta that is charred around the edges in a cast iron skillet. Today's meat was pork cheeks that was rich and tender. Italian food doesn't usually make me say \""Wow,\"" but this dish did. It's a little pricy at $17 for one serving, but it seems to be the going rate these days at other Italian places as well for far less grade of lasagna. \n\nWhen my 4 year old broke her water glass, she felt bad.

"I was hesitant to return to this location. I've only had a couple positive experiences there with one stylist Elisha. I'm not a needy guy, but after all it is my hair.

What an awesome stylist you get spoiled and what a high bar she sets. But again I was unable to keep her she quite busy. That's when my heather experience happened. Tattoos were cool, but she can't cut hair and was wasn't much for listening, so yes crappy haircut. I wasn't sure about taking a chance, so I called and someone new answered not the last gal!

"A word of advice when dining at Claim Jumpers, do NOT go there if you are on a diet or trying to lose weight! Oh boy, if this is how the stinky old scraggly gold prospectors would eat back in the 1840's, then I think the Arizona Lottery dude is grossly underweight ( http://www.nba.com/media/suns/arizona_lottery_120.gif ).\n\nI was fair warned by Chris T. ( http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TQo2DFe6O6LWALv_awgcCQ ) that the portion sizes are very large there, and he wasn't kidding! You all know that feeling you get when you eat too much? I don't mean the feeling like \""...wow, I'm full...\"" and you keep picking at the food. I don't even mean the feeling like \""...OMG, I can't believe I ate the whole thing!\"". What I am referring to is that OTHER feeling, the one you DON'T want to admit you had. The one when you try to think back on it, you start to perspire and hope no one is watching you think about it. COME ON, YOU CAN'T DENY IT!!! It's the feeling you get when you eat soooooo much that .................I'm going to say it...............YOUR EYE'S HURT! There........I feel much better, I said it.\n\nNow, back to the restaurant. It's not their fault that I ate that much, no. It's my own fault because I scoffed at the original warning from Chris. I said \""I'm on a diet, and I can be strong\"". \n\nThe wait time would have been real long except I called earlier and made a reservation (I suggest you do as well). I went to with my wife, sister and her boyfriend and whenever you go with more than 2 people you have to order appetizers. For some reason you know you aren't any MORE hungry than if you were alone or on a date, but I think your stomach thinks that there is \""strength in numbers\"" so you can take on a bigger battle. Anyway, we ordered the cheesy potato soup, some avocado thingys and garlic bread. For my meal I ordered a pile of pasta and chicken. I DIDNT EVEN MAKE IT TO THE DESSERTS (....ouch......eye....pain)!\n\nThe potato soup was pretty good, but I've had better. It had a lot of onion/onion flavoring which is a big no no for my wife, and she was excited to order it. I didn't really enjoy the avocado thingys, they had a weird taste when combined with the side of dressing/sauce stuff. The garlic bread WAS the bomb though. Very greasy and garlicky and yummy! It went great with my meal which was a chicken alfredo over linguine (something along those lines). I'm pretty sure they serve their meals on a garbage can lid (or at least a plate of that size). It was piled high and wide. \n\nSo here's the million dollar question....\""Why would someone complain about large portion size? Take the rest home and save it for tomorrow\"". Well that's because your portion size is reflected in the check. The prices were higher than a normal \""fast/sitdown\"" type restaurant but the food wasn't much better. So you pay for MORE of the same that you can't even finish, and if you do finish it you run the risk of going blind!!!!\n\nNow I'm going to put my dark shades on, grab my long, retractable cane and go to Pizzeria Uno.....They are cheaper and I love the \""Rattlesnake Pasta\"".......also I think they have a special seat for blind people.   :)",824,2

It'll have the same nuances of a legit deli sandwich. \n*The chicken breast is a great canvas for the sweet onion sauce, Sriracha or truly any of their other concoctions\n*Ask for green peppers and onions (if you like em) to be added to your sandwich before toasting. It has a nice effect. \n\nThe FUZE tea with honey is actually pretty good too.

"Had a wrong exercise bike rang up, delivered and assembled at my home. Young kid at the store and my wife at home (who didn't see what I bought).

They were out of turkey breast, so I okayed a lunch-meat turkey sandwich.

I don't want a beer with my sandwich, but I do want the sandwich to be passable or better.  \n\nOur waitress was okay, which made me consider bumping this to two stars; she looked as if she was in college, so the odds are that the one high spot will leave, and the rest will stay the same.\n\nThe Bagel Factory on the other end of the neighborhood far exceeds this for quality, at the same price.",237,0

"One Sentence Review:  Uniquely terrible service, average food.\n\nSo, here is the story:\n\nI had reservations for 6 at 8:00 on a Saturday night.  I walked up to the hostess with my date.  She ignored us.  It was as if we were in the wrong place, so I walked up to the door, just in case there was a second host station.  There wasn't.  I walked back to the the host station and, after introducing myself to the hostess (she never did welcome us), I was informed that two other members of our party were at the bar.  Cold.  Really cold. \n\nWe wait at the bar for a while and then start asking to be seated.  We had to ask four different people within the course of 30 minutes before anyone seated us.  The table we ultimately were seated in had been empty the entire time.  No explanation, let alone apology, for the delay.\n\nWe sit down.  Two members of our party had to leave at 10:00 for a show.  We informed the server.  He said no problem.  \n\nAt about 9:30, yes 1.5 hours after our reservation time, the appetizers arrive.  By the time entrees arrive the two of us who had a show to go to were on the way out the door.  They never did get more than a bite or two.  We noticed a manager-type speaking to them on their way out and handing them an envelope, and so assumed they were taken care of and continued with out now excruciatingly long meal. (note:  having done the tour at Alinea, the longer tasting menu at per se, 20 courses at Moto, etc., long meals are just fine by me.  But, averaging less than a course an hour is just ridiculous)  \n\nThe rest of our entrees arrive, along with the deserts for the two of us that had to depart (clearly no communication between servers and kitchen).  I don't have a fork, but that is just the same as my pork chop is so raw that it would be unsafe to eat.  Not that I could have eaten it because the chop was surrounded by uncooked fat which no human could chew sufficiently to consume.  I excuse myself to the restroom and spit out the nastiness, return to the table, and eat the entrees left behind by our recently departed guests.\n\nI will save you the details of additional disasters (drinks that were mis-made, chairs so short that I looked like a child in need of a booster seat, laughably large candles at the table that prevented cross-table conversation, food coming out in the wrong order)\n\nThis was, by far, the work dining experience I have ever had.  But the real kicker occurred the next morning when we realized that, instead of taking care of the two folks who, because of their service, were able to eat only their appetizers, the manager had given them a coupon to return for a free desert!  Seriously, a free desert!  \n\nNothing we ate (5 different small plates, five different appetizers, five different entrees, and two deserts) was any better than the food at one of Vegas' buffets.  In fact, all I can remember are the things that went horribly wrong. \n\nPlease, for your own sake, stay away.",733,0
"The Tap Room was better than expected for a hotel pub. Of course, it's pricey. They're located in the Omni William Penn after all. The menu has typical pub fare: burgers, fish and chips, chili and some salads, etc. I had a cod sandwich, which came with a side. I chose the farro salad, which is something along the lines of a tabouli or other grain salad. It was nice to have something different. I enjoyed my spicy Beer, Pepper Vodka and Tabasco cocktail. I think it was called a Spicy Dog, but I can't find the drink on their online menu.  I liked the idea of their \""Street Food\"" side-menu. It had six different international options, inspired by the places Omni chefs had lived or visited. The atmosphere was on the formal side, with lots of business travelers having an after-meeting meeting/cocktail.",184,2

"OVERALL:\nGiven the popularity of Girasole, I was disappointed that this place didn't even come close to living up to the hype. Although there were some highlights, there were plenty of negatives to counter them.\n\nSERVICE:\nDespite having a reservation, we were made to wait for over 45 minutes for a table, standing outside in the cold. Also, we were only given cutlery for two of the three people in our party. Not a good start. Once seated, though, the service was good. Our server, Vito, was pleasant and attentive.\n\nFOOD:\nDisappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold, and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner, but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore, the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start. \n\nFortunately, it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal.\n\nMy steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However, it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned. \n\nDesserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which sounded delicious, but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake, which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting.\n\nAMBIANCE: \nProbably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nProbably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer, but if it's a busy night and it's cold out, I'd give it a miss.",451,1
"Ordered a half Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini with no sauce.  Was really excited about the baby spinach on it.  A whole panini was delivered to my table, first mistake.  The bread was so soggy inside, I could only stomach half before it just tasted like baby food.  There was a piece of artichoke heart about the size of a dime on the whole sandwich - win?  There wasn't a single leaf of spinach to be found.  The only thing they got right was the part about leaving off the sauce.\n\nStick to cookies and other baked goods, PB!  It's what you're good at.  Leave the specialty sandwiches to real sandwich shops.",145,0
"I love, love, love Grabbagreen. I don't eat any junk, so it is perfect for me. I have had the Detox juice and love it, I have them add ginger to it. I love the So-Cal with tofu.

"This place... ROCKS!!!! They even have real Thrifty's ice-cream-ala Chocolate Malted Crunch!!! OMG!!! Sooooo good!

"Went to Hank's on a sunday evening. This is the second time in a row the food and service was down right mediocre. Martinis good, steaks very average.We got one basket of bread for four and requested more at least 6 times and received none even after being told it would be right out. Asked for waters at least 6 times and did not get one glass. The waitress had no help bussing or serving water if asked. There we sat with no bread for quite awhile. Then some people from the kitchen brought our salads. about two minutes later the dinners showed up. The fries were extra soggy. We will not be back to this way over priced restaurant. You are much better off going to another Station Casino restaurant like Sonoma at Sunset Station or the Broiler at Boulder Station for atmosphere and value.",168,0
"This is my new favorite place for lunch in C-U. Good selection of sandwiches/salads/soups, reasonable prices, plenty of tables, and a nice atmosphere. It feels more grown up than most of your other lunch options, but the food is ready super fast. A number of veggie selections, and the desserts look amazing.",70,3
"Great Job. The tech Marvin showed up on time (even called a half hour early to give an ETA) and cleaned all the carpets. He was helpful, had great advice for maintaining the carpets, and most importantly, the carpets are SO CLEAN now! Marvin got rid of some pesky stains, and the hallway looks amazing.",66,4
"Since I moved to Scottsdale 2 years ago, it took me a while to find a nail place I liked.  Once I found Top Nails about one year ago, I refuse to go anywhere else!  First off, it's a family business and the ladies that work here super nice and so friendly. \n\nSecondly, and even more importantly, most every time I get my nails done here my manicure lasts AT LEAST seven days, with no chipping, which is unheard of in most other nail salons as my nails will usually start chipping within a couple days.  Top Nails must have some magic because I've never had my manicures last this long!! They are amazing and I won't go anywhere else!!",149,4
"Decent pizza, but they told me one price on the phone when I ordered (the \""special\"", then when I came in they charged me a different price. Manager didn't care at all. I called to try to make it right, not really concerned about the $2, was very nice about it, but the manager was not concerned and literally hung up on me when I was trying to discuss it.",84,0
"SUMMARY:  This was about the 6th time I've dined at Mert's.  First time since joining Yelp.  I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.  \n\nDETAILS:\nWe were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right, and the appetizer (soul sampler) came out in a very reasonable time.  But it took at least another 20 minutes (maybe even 30) to get our entrees: BBQ with sides, and blackened pork chops with sides. And while the sides and chops all got good comments, we did NOT like the very molasses-heavy BBQ.  This is nothing like I've ever eaten in North or South Carolina (and I'm a native).  That needs to be revamped or better disclaimed on the menu.\n\nAnyway, so unlike my previous visits, I left very disappointed and unfortunately, left my out-of-town friends with a bad impression of what has usually been a good place.",230,1
"Met my dad and sister here on a Wednesday night a couple of months ago. \n\nMy dad eats out a lot, but rarely complains about food or service.He said this was the worst service he had experienced in his entire life!\n\nWe ordered 3 little starters: 'pizza,' and chicken. We were discussing what else to order when the server came. We asked to have a couple more minutes. We didn't see anyone for 10 minutes. We finally put our order in. We ordered some heavier foods- 5 cheese mac, and 1-2 other tapas. Different people showed up to the table to refill our water glasses, but no food. \n\nThe waitress came back maybe 30 minutes later, and said she was sorry & that they were busy. (Um, there was one other table inside, and maybe 5 tops outside). She said the food would be out soon. Well, 1 hour after arriving, we still hadn't gotten more than the 2-3 tapas from the beginning. We were offered a coupon for the brunch. You think we're coming back?\n\nMaybe they just need to limit their menu to something easier to handle. A lot of the food sounded great, unique, and tasty. But, unfortunately we didn't get to try any of it. And, I doubt my dad will ever take us back. I certainly can't afford the expensive tapas plates myself.",306,1
"So I wouldnt have ever visited this place but a friend invited me to meet up with her while she was in town seeing family.. I ordered the city hot flavor chicken wings.. Its basically a buffalo style hot wing sauce, but tastier.. I was  impressed!  They run a great happy hour on their appetizers, its like $5-$6 each and full portions.. The sliced sirloin sliders with aus ju is yummy too! I have visited the place 4 times now, service 3/4 times kinda sucked but I like the food so go back. The bartender i had one time sitting at the bar top sucked. She ignored me the first 10 min I was there. I guess because I wasnt a guy to flirt with. The place is a very casual bar atmosphere.. Nothing pretty, but kinda a laid back chill ambiance. I wish the patio area  had a non smoking section also.\nThe one thing I hate is they have non filtered yuck Arizona water!!!! It is HORRIBLE!! I cant even gag it down. So youre forced to order a soda or beer.\n I go for the wings but the service and most of the staff could be upgraded to better serve the customers.",248,2
"This place is pretty & exactly what you'd expect. Cactus and some xmas lights. What is awesome is that it's free, you can check out the factory yourself, it stays open until 10, free samples, you can take your own free photos with Santa (or buy), & check out their gift shops! Of course the chocolate is expensive but they have all these great things for you to experience with your family during the holidays. All the employees are cheery as well. I had to support them by buying hot cocoa! Ps: the free samples are better than any other chocolate bar. Mmm.",125,3
"This place's menu held much promise for me, but was quite a disappointment.  I've only been there once, but there was a common characteristic running through all their food that was hard to ignore...no seasoning!\n\nI love Cajun food, primarily because I enjoy the type of food and the spices.  At CYD, you can find all your favorites on the menu; just don't look for them to be properly seasoned.\n\nJalepeno Deviled Eggs:  there was an essence of jalapeno but absolutely no kick...and no salt.  Just a bland deviled egg.\n\nFried Oysters:  A little too greasy and absolutely no seasoning in the batter.  I'll go so far to say that they were the most bland fried oysters I've ever been served.\n\nMy sides were \""all day green beans\"" (bland), collards (bland), and slaw (bland).\n\nThe quality of food was pretty good.  Just don't look for authentic cajun flavor here.  Maybe I hit them on a bad day, but you'd think that I would've liked something here...but not so much.  Seriously...salt, cayenne, and peppers are pretty cheap.  CYD ought to invest five bucks and give these a try.",278,1
"I've been here several times, last week was the straw though. I bought several items - one being an espresso machine for the boy. I inspected three boxes of the espresso machine which all had been dropped or opened. I asked an associate to see if they were getting any more in, he just said no without looking it up.  I opened the one with the ripped tab which might have been from someone picking the box up, the machine was still wrapped up, styrofoam in place and all so I decided to buy it and return it if there was a problem. I stood in line for over 30 minutes (which I don't mind- I understand my sorry butt didn't think about getting it sooner) however 3 days prior to xmas they only had 2 people running check out and returns. I was about the 10th in line too. *handFace*\n\nAnyhoo, the clerk was very courteous and didn't have any issues with my 20% off coupons so once I was at the stand it was a breeze. \n\nFast forward to Xmas morning... boy is super happy with the awesome espresso maker and beans from Coffee Rush I purchased.  He opens it up to find that it had clearly been a returned item.... as almost all of the frother, cups, cleaning pieces were missing... empty cardboard box was what we found inside. AND it had been dropped - bottom of the water container was shattered. I just about cursed because as a store - getting a returned item from a customer... and a $300 item as well.. Don't you think to check it first before putting it back on the shelf?? \n\nFast forward 2 days post-xmas... go into the BBB store with the espresso machine which is heavy, I waited in line but what I observed was pretty stupid. The one associate who was doing returns was definitely over-run with a line of 5+ people, the manager next to her was just looking around... completely void of the line of customers or that the associate had asked him for help. Once he did get the hint a few minutes later after walking across the returns area several times, he tried to help a customer but they turned around and asked the other associate what to do.  Not very impressed by the managers lack of knowledge and inability to help customers. You are a manager- know how to complete a return. \n\nOh yea and the process to get a new espresso machine... since there weren't any in stock, I waited to return the purchase one, returned it, was then sent back to the kitchen area where another associate ordered another one, who then sent me back to the front to wait in line again to get my refund amount (since we chose a different model with a refund of $10). They couldn't have done that at one station with one associate so I didn't have to wait in line twice for the same transaction and use up 3 different associates time??  \n\nUgh... if not for those 20% of coupons I would buy everything online.",644,1
"Very Disappointed! The size, decor and amenities in the low ceiling room was what you would expect in a mid-range motel. The single sink bath had serious plumbing problems and a broken mirror. Check-in and check-out at the under staffed front desk was chaos. No queue line just a free for all. The common areas were fine, not special, but rough around the edges. The base boards were scuffed and wall edges were chipped. The conservatory was very nice.\n\nFor the first time in a Vegas hotel we were disrespected by staff 3 times. The hype and price do not match the reality.",130,1

"Happy Hour is what lured my friend and I in here. It is everyday from 5:30pm-7:30pm and reverse from 10pm-2am. The drink specials are nothing spectacular, but the food is decent. \n\nThere are multiple selections of fried food items and a wedge salad for the \""health weary\"" individual. My friend and I started with a sangria and a Guinness. The sangria was more like juice. It got me to think about what places made a good version and lead to the urge to just make my own. So few places have a wow inducing version and it is so easy to make.\n\nWhen we flagged down our bartender to order food; we got the pigs in a blanket ($4),  mozzarella squares ($4), and the signature PBJ dessert ($6, not on the happy hour specials). All three items were delicious. The strawberry jam for the fried dessert was odd. It just tasted like a sweeter and fruitier ketchup. Stick with the chocolate.",215,2
"I love the unique flavors that Ripples offers. You walk in here thinking you know exactly what you're going to have and your bombarded with the most delectable, tempting options that you begin to second, and third guess yourself.\n\nSo my recommendation is definitely step away from your norm, try something you've not yet had like chai, khulfi , 6x chocolat, cardamom etc. Or you can go with my rec, hazelnut, because it to-die-for creamilicious.....",105,4

"First time here.  Kinda dead for a Saturday night. Came for TVs to watch football. Called before we came to see if there was happy hour...'yes, until seven.'  Got here and NO happy hour :-(.  Great bar area for watching football. They were out of potatoes! At an Irish bar!  Weird.  Ruben sandwich was ok, not enough meat. I had yummy pretzels with cheese sauce and mustard.  Caesar salad was bland, not enough dressing, and like, five, croutons.  I would probably just go somewhere else if I had a choice...nothing special.",123,1
"The only thing that would improve this taco trailer would be a concrete definition of the hours at which I can patronize them.  Patronize is of course intended to signify a giving of business, not a stating of \""Oh, hey there champ, it's ok, you can do better next time.\""  Essentially, they offer chicken and carne asada, with three basic preparations: Tacos for $1 a piece, burritos for $5, and Quesadillas for $7.  There is also a burger and a hot dog,  but come on, is that why you are here? If you order one of the meats, it comes off the grill, and you get to watch them chop it up with a crazy knife, on what appears to be a well-worn tree stump.  You definitely want to order \""with everything\""  and an horchata to drink is also the course of wisdom.  Final note: the people watching is amazing, in addition to the almost cartoonishly cowboy-looking dudes, I had a random guy who parked in the front wearing an FBI (Federal Boobie Inspector) shirt and raced off as soon as possible when his food was ready.  Wouldn't want anyone thinking your love of the Charlie's taco made you...sexually ambiguous?",263,4

"Ever have one of those days where you're feeling too lazy to cook and don't feel like going out to a restaurant?   Yeah sure, we all do right?  How about the days where you feel too lazy to even shower and can't bear to pick up the phone to call in a take out order?   Just me?   Anyway, I have these days.  I call them Sundays.\n\nSundays are often days where I need to just be able to jump on my laptop, fill out what I want to eat on the computer during a Mad Men commercial break, and have it appear at my door as if by magic (Gasoline, how does it work?)\n\nTo be brutally honest though, this is the only reason I ever eat Thai House.  The food is always decent, but rarely spectacular.  My favorite dishes so far have been the curries, namely Panang with Pork (the Red and Green were also good).  I've been unimpressed with most of the noodle dishes thus far (Pad See Ew in particular), and the Tom Yum soup was lacking when I've had it a few times.  \n\nSo stick with the Curries and order in between your episodes of Game of Thrones and the Killing and let Thai House handle the rest.   But put some pants on before you answer the door for heaven's sake.",289,2
"I'm sorry Graze. I love your food but my most recent experience with your server has forced me to downgrade my love for you. And probably not return for a long time. \n\nI did not get the name of this said male server but I had the unfortunate experience of being unattended for such lengthy periods of time (this has never happened at any of my other experiences at Tory Miller's restaurant, or any decent restaurants). I had to request the help of other servers/hosts at least 3 times to locate where my server is. He just disappeared. And every single time he appeared he was in a hurry. To disappear again, probably. \n\nI enjoyed my cheese curds and kimchi burrito, however I wish there were smaller portions of both. Even sharing half with my boyfriend didn't stop me from feeling overloaded after the meal... The cheese curds seemed a tad salty after half a basket of them but still love the melty cheese! \n\nYeah.. Be warned, come unhungry and be prepared to wait if you get said unfortunate server. Sigh, what a misfortune. One of my favorite local restaurants have to be tucked aside for the next few months.",248,2
"Pretty tasty, simple, and fairly quick.\nTuna please.\nDon't come into this location at lunch cuz it's a madhouse with all the local businesses and the specialty college across the road.\nAny other time the location seems to be rather quiet, a couple of cars in the lot and maybe three customers inside.\nThe options are plentiful and I like that.\nNot exactly sure why they tear the bread OUT of the loaf and throw it away.  Talk about throwing away money.  They need to quit that practice unless the customer specifies that's what they want.  Or is that the big selling point of the Jimmy John's subs???\nCrazy that it takes four or five people to put together one sandwich but I guess they've got the system down to a science and that's why they can say they're fast.\nIn general, I like the sandwiches and they're a good change from Subway or any of the other area sandwich shops.",205,2
The food was very mediocre. Most of the food was very greasy and bland. Many of the Asian dishes such as the lemon chicken were undercooked. The only decent part of the buffet was the desserts. I don't think the food here is worth it for the price. I suggest another buffet instead of this one when going to Vegas.,70,1
"Yes, their signage isn't the greatest and the place is usually empty but they are a hidden gem!  We have eaten there twice and both times had terrific food that was great value for the money.  The lasagna was delicious and made with love.  The eggplant parm was delicious and homemade (my boyfriend knows good eggplant and this was fresh).  Look past the exterior and you will find a hidden gem with a simple menu of fresh delicious food!  The pizza was yummy and the staff is friendly.  I hope they stick around as the neighborhood needs more gems like these.",119,3
"I really, really want this bar to be successful. The interior is sexy and sophisticated with plenty of seating. The house band or soul singers are fantastic, some of the best I have heard in town.

"Love the location. Across Venetian/Palazzo/Wynn/Fashion Show mall, close to all the action on the strip. We stayed here because we were coming in Friday midnight and got a cheap rate on hotwire and wanted to save money since we got the Palazzo for Saturday night. As we got in it seemed like hip hop night at the bar (gilleys I think ) and lots of rougher people around as we walked towards registration. Actually the next day was also rougher crowd. Not as bad a circus circus though.\nWe got a suite and it was HUGE! but the decor was very dated. 90's almost cheesy! with reddish marble in the bathrooms. (there were 2) and those alien looking lamps, the ones were its springs into 5 different bulbs hanging over the sofa. Also, it didn't feel completely clean. The tub felt gritty, like maybe they didn't wash the ajax off and saw grime on the handles. The lights were so dim that I couldn't examine everything else completely. I know it's an older hotel so I wasn't expecting anything fancy and we just used it to sleep. I wouldn't stay here if you plan to spend a lot of time in your room. \nIt's just way different than when I started coming here as a child back when it used to be kid friendly with the arcade and pirate show. I remember coming here when they had social house sushi and celebs were dining maybe 10 years ago and it's just gone downhill. This is a cheap decent hotel in the middle of the action. (I'd pick this over Monte Carlo/Excalibur/Luxor/NYNY/Ballys but not over Mandalay Bay/MGM/Caesars (other 4 star hotels)",372,2
"This place was quick and efficient to deal with but I have doubts about their quality.  Items were finished on time and neatly pressed but I don't think they were cleaned properly or thoroughly.  I don't know where they dryclean their garments but mine smelled rather rank after being cleaned.  So much so that I had to get them cleaned again.  Take your drycleaning elsewhere, both the drycleaning places in southern highlands are certainly lacking at best.",95,1

"So are you guys going to to have water or do you want anything else... The food was great but the service from our server was lackluster. We got a salad, two pizzas, three appetizers, two glasses of wine and a pitcher yet our server seemed to think we were going to be a table of water and pizza.

My go to breakfast joint. Nothing super special about the menu...just the classics. Always great service and the food is served promptly. I think I like that it's just the classics.

"After searching high and low, I can say that the Smallman Street Deli is probably the second best delicatessen in Pittsburgh.  That's not a huge compliment, however, as the deli scene is almost completely devoid of passable options (the only one I even like is Szmidt's, and they have a much smaller menu).\n\nThis Squirrel Hill eatery is but a shadow of the pastrami purveyors of New York City.  Were it to move across the state, Smallman Street would be but a footnote, unable to crack anyone's Top 10 list in Philadelphia.  But sometimes a facsimile is good enough, or even the best one can get.  While there may be better beef brisket and superior salami on distant horizons, one can still enjoy the capable corned beef and likable lox in this little corner of Western PA.",180,1

Despite that Vanguard had cleared the check with them.. I'm guaranteeing BofA made interest off of my $7k! Don't get me started on what they have done to our housing market.. Ahh.. Thank God I can bank with USAA..",166,0
"Eh.\n\nThe hotel/casino are ok.   The newer tower where we stayed was nice.   The room was pretty decent.   The buffet was pretty nasty, although the pasta man was super nice.  Great guy.\n\nMy issue was the customer service.   Seems like everyone we talked to there hated their jobs and were therefore unprofessional.    One of the valets simply stole the baggage cart we'd planned on using when we notified him that we'd be taking our own luggage in.   The desk people generally sucked and were short with us.\n\nLove staying in old town, won't be staying at the Golden Nugget again though.    Great location - I will give 'em that at least.\n\nEDIT** -- I forgot to say that even though I was up late every night gambling and enjoying adult activities ;^) , the music was super loud outside in the Fremont area, and the room was loud too.   Had to wear earplugs to sleep even when it was late.   That sucked.",217,1
"after a red-eye from phx to charlotte (connecting to jamaica), we were famished and this was the only thing open in the charlotte airport. \n\nusual high-priced items and not quite enough, but it was tasty enough to satisfy until we arrived at the all-inclusive glutton fest.",65,2
First thing I noticed was the restaurant it's self was a little plain and the ceilings were quite high so the room echoed when people spoke . \n\nFor the food ... Oh the food ! Nothing short of delicious ! We did the tasting menu and added the Foie Gras then ordered a bottle of wine . Everything came out in a timely manner and was irresistible . The bill came out to almost 1000 but it was well worth it ...,94,4
"This review is based on my kid's enjoyment of the place, and on the atmosphere. My 5 and 8 yr old boys had a blast, played for three hours non-stop and wanted more. They could've stayed in there all week. I'm not much of an arcade fan, but I can see the place's appeal- it had a bunch of motion games, like the ones where you move like you're actually in the cockpit of a plane, or inside a racecar. The timeplay cards made it convenient for me, since I didn't have to keep giving them quarters every 15 minutes, like at Circus Circus. It is kind of pricey, but when you consider the quality of the games, I guess they can justify the premium. And most importantly, my boys had a blast.",172,3
"I would not recommend eating at the Peoria Cafe. I ordered two pancakes and bacon for my breakfast. The bacon was nice and crispy like I ordered, however the pancakes were tasteless. \n\nWhen I poured the syrup onto my plate from the container sitting on the table, to my surprise a large fly came out in the syrup! Disgusting! The rest of my friends refused to eat after seeing this. The waitress took the plate and the syrup from the table and apologized. We all left and will not be returning to the Peoria Cafe. The back door was open and there were also bugs flying around. I'm not sure if you can attach a picture to this, but I will if I can.",145,0
"Wound up here after Blues was closed for a private function.  The DC restaurant has great BBQ, so though we would try this place.  The meat was very salty and mine was dried out.  I expect spices on ribs, but these had been in the heater too long. Smallish drinks for Vegas, and the atmosphere is weird...more like a food court than a restaurant.",79,1

Stayed here for two nights after spending four nights at Mandalay Bay. It was a bit older looking and abused which was to be expected. we had a strip view on the 29th floor and that was nice. Cost was very reasonable but like most properties there was a 20 dollar a day charge for use of the amenities which is annoying. The casino was easy to maneuver through and the food court and casino bar were nice also. Best thing about this place was the smell. It has a very pleasing aroma throughout the entire structure. Overall a good experience. I would stay here again.,122,2
"Annoying to have 50 hands in your face,\nwhen trying to make your way up the strip.\n\nDisgusting to have 1000's of cards,\nlittering the entire sidewalk of the strip,\nwhen trying to make your way back down it.",62,0
"Is it the Ray's from New York? Doubtful. That being said, and for who anyone who knows anything about New York Pizza IN New York, there are a thousand \""Ray's\"" and \""Famous Ray's\"" and the like, and this could very well be one of them. It's not the most amazing pizza I've ever had, but it's far from the worst too. Pizza is such a subjective thing these days, and I truly feel that people have been too hard on this place. \n\nIts really good New York style pizza. That sentence should tell you everything you need to know about the place. If that's not good enough for you, ok...then here's some more you should know:\n\nThe pizza is damn good, the service is damn good, and the prices are fair. Other than that, its pizza, ok? Good pizza. If I lived in the area, it would probably be my go-to for delivery (if they offer that, I don't remember). We live in AZ, people. Great NY pizza is hard to find, and this is some of the better stuff around.",245,3
"I heard about this place because Michele was raving about it.  She had a tin that she can refill for a cheaper price.  We walked in and the smell was fantastic.  We checked out the menu as we had up to 3 choices to make for the tin.  The first 2 were already decided, Spicy Cheese and Caramel.  Then I heard the most amazing words I have ever heard.  Our flavor of the Month is bacon.  SOLD!!!!!! \n\nWe were there for a couple of minutes, got our popcorn and left.  It was all I could do to not open the container in the car.  Bacon was so good!!!",137,4
The girl doing the seating was rude and aggresive. I ordered eggs over medium and they came super runny. Italian sausage was loaded with pepper. Very expensive,33,1
"Stopped in after several friends recommended it.  It was ok. The Caesar salad was run of the mill average.  Did not come with lemon.  The rack of lamb was good.  Tender. The sauce green bean mix that was the bed was soggy tho. The cherry custard was nice.  Hint of cinnamon was a nice surprise. \n\nOn the negative side,  the water was warm.  I requested lemon and it didn't show up until half way through my meal.  The main course was brought out before I had hardly touched my salad.  They took it back.  Which is probably why things were soggy. It took over 15 minutes for the dessert to show up.  I enquired about an herbal tea. They didn't have any,  so I declined.  Then someone shows up with a green tea., which I sent away.\n\nThe kicker was the waiters comment when he brought my check.  He said I had eaten more than anyone he had seen that day and had taken my time.  How rude!  I didn't finish my salad or my dessert.  Not sure how 3 courses is excessive.  Rude!",246,2
"Went here just before 6pm on December 9th.  I only know that because it was where my daughter wanted to go for her birthday dinner.  We were sat within like 10 minutes and the host were friendly.  Our \""server\"" was Melissa, and I only found out because I looked at her nametag.  She didn't do a proper greet, she took a while to deliver drinks, the only part of the welcome that she did right was offering a wine sample.  She didn't offer refills on soups, or drinks, had to wait to get the plates clears until we stacked them.  I saw her take a dirty plate from another table and put it on the tray while boxing a different table's food, and she lied about how something was made because the bowl was messy and she didn't want to take it back and get another that looked presentable.  They were also told that we were there for my kid's birthday and no acknowledgement or anything.  The assistant manager?  might have even been a service pro was the reason for 2 stars instead of 1.  She was nice and engaging when I told her what happened and seemed a bit mortified by some of the stuff I told her.  The manager seemed like a donkey (some words can't be said on yelp)  He was very dismissive and acted like I didn't know what I was talking about, and then I informed him that I was a server trainer at a different location.  Meal was comped, which I told them I would pay for it so I could get the survey.  Guess I will have to stick with either going to the locations I know or making the food at home myself.",360,1
"I love how quaint this hotel is!!! I love the decor. I love the theme. I also love how they use Bath and Body Works products for the complimentary toiletries. I love their fish tank. I love that they have a Starbucks. I also love how they have a gym.\n\nI have two complaints. One is that they ran out of non-smoking rooms, which is my own fault because I checked in really, really late. Smoking rooms are freakin stinky!!! And two is that their shuttle to the Strip is not often.\n\nIf you don't mind staying off the Strip, this hotel is pretty cool place to stay. They have tons of slots and restaurants. Also, if you have your car, the drive to Strip is not far.",159,3
"For someone who wants good quality and freshly made dishes,  avoid this place!   It was a waste of money and I had to nit-pick my food because all the items looked like they were sitting there food the past 6-10+ hours.   \n\nI had taken my family there for dinner and I cannot find food that's fresh to eat - I literally had to force myself to eat something.  The fruit selection of honeydew, cantaloupes,  and pineapples were the best part.  \n\nTheir sushi rolls (only 3 kinds) looked like it belongs in the trash.   The Mexican dishes with the Pico de gallo looked so old!   Barf!  Asian food included bbq wings.   \n\nSave money and go somewhere else.",168,1
"The lunch is actually a good deal, quick on the uptake (i.e. I can get in and out within 40 minutes) and the service is attentive.  It is never that busy (which is a bit of a shame) it is after all still a restaurant at a W.  That being said, the menu is designed for business travelers.  heavy on the salads and sandwiches.  The menu skews American and slightly southwestern.  I was impressed by the service, they made some modifications to the entr\u00e9e when I had a friend who had severe food allergies brought it up.  I never think to come here but compared to the District at Sheraton, I think this place is the way to go.",154,3

They even still rent some VHS.\n\nIt's a great place to get some snacks or cute presents, when you want to spend a quiet evening watching movies.\n\nIt's a good idea to invest in becoming a member then movie rentals are only 2$ each .",144,3
"I too, was invited to an event at this hotel.\n\nUnfortunately, the hotel staff and marquee were useless. I've never seen this before in a Hyatt, but not only were we directed to an empty room, but it took the staff (two folks) about 10+ minutes to send us to the correct room for the meeting.\n\nOnce in the meeting room, it was cold.\n\nConsequently, our food was a bit cooler than our liking. However, it was tasty.\n\nThe staff was friendly, from the front desk/receptionist staff to the waitstaff...all friendly.\n\nBecause we did not stay in the rooms, I would, however, consider a night's stay another time...just to be fair.",163,2
"Came here with a friend after a craving for fish on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nSakana is located in the corner of a shopping center with Target on Maryland Ave; sort of easy to miss because it's tucked in the corner.  The place isn't big, but not crammed in any way.  \n\nWe decided on the AYCE sushi option, as the menu is vast.  The only downside is that there isn't really any sashimi; or rather, the sashimi is not just simple raw cuts of fish, but instead sashimi dressed up in sauces, fruits or veggies.  However, there are definitely many different interesting rolls to try, and they were quite good.  I'm more of a nigiri and sashimi eater, but I definitely like rolls as well.\n\nAll in all, the fish here is just average, but the rolls were definitely creative, nicely presented, and tasty.  The cooked food was actually the best part of the menu surprisingly; the pork belly and tempura calamari was top-notch.  \n\nHave I been to a better AYCE sushi buffet at 24.95?  You bet.  But this one's not bad and will do for a pinch if you're in the area.",272,2
"The food is ok, I went with my significant other before we caught a show the other night. We got there in time to catch the happy hour menu, even those prices we're more than i would pay for the food.

"Ehhh, I think I used to like this place when I was young and before discovering Scottsdale. There was an event last night with a radio station and a R&B singer - we thought it would be a good idea to check it out... and we were wrong. \n\nThe crowd was full of ratchet females and wannabe rappers. The drinks did nothing for my buzz - I think I was drinking pure red bull because there was no taste of vodka. There's a designated dance floor, which is nice, but not when the DJ only plays 2 Chainz. \n\nMaaaaybe I'm spoiled by Scottsdale nightlife, but I would never come back here.",144,1
"For some reason Extreme Pita isn't able to top the food at nearby Pita Pit. It's not that their isn't a good amount of pita selection ranging from those with beef to all veggie, or that they don't stuff those pitas full with lots of vegetables like they should. It's because I can't taste anything in those pitas! Today my pita was filled up with all sorts of nice veggies, humus, hot sauce, feta, and tzatziki . I caught the tzatziki but everything else just kind of transformed into cardboard in my mouth. Must be the large chain syndrome.\n\nStill, thanks for filling me up, and it's always nice to have a healthy fast food joint nearby.",156,2
"The first thing that you notice is that the food is overpriced.\nThen you taste it.\nThe worst burger I have ever had. And that comes from a lifelong experience with burgers. I would never, ever give it a second chance. It was greasy, fatty, flavorless, and metallic.\nThe fries mirrored the burger.  An awful dining experience.\nThis place is perched on the lowest rung. Lower than the corner greasy spoon.\nSteer far, far away from Fatburger. You have many other choices for burgers and fries, and they are all better than this place.",122,0
"We tried the 13 course tasting menu with extended wine selection. The service was wonderful and 100% spot on.\n\nThe food however, was quite a let down. Some dishes really excelled in their taste and presentation, while many were just a puzzling question mark followed by a mediocre taste. \n\nA few memories include a shot of squeezed juice which is considered a course which is more suited as a canape. \n\nA salad which included a few leafs of lettuce with two small slivers of cheese. I appreciated the craftsmanship of the 30 year old cheese, but it in no way complimented the lettuce and left you wondering why it wasn't paired with something more suitable or to paraphrase, enjoyable.\n\nOut of the 13 courses, there were 3 or 4 that really shined.. the buffalo being one of these. \n\nWhen you average in the odd interior decor it's apparent that attention has not been paid to all the details.. and that's what a fine dining experience really should include. If you're aiming for multi-michelin star experience, detail detail detail. \n\nOn another high note, the wine pairings were absolutely wonderful and the sommelier was both informative and wonderful in not only introducing each pairing, but being able to provide excellent alternatives when pairings didn't go quite well.\n\nThe card which gave us a list of all the courses + pairings was a nice touch at the end.\n\nFor Arizona this is a step up in experience and i'm happy to see restaurants of such caliber really offering alternatives to places such as Binkley's.\n\nIt's worth trying, but for us there weren't many dishes we'd be craving on a return visit for. \n\nAfter reading other reviews, it may be an issue that Kai has invested a good amount of time in perfecting the smaller tasting menus and main entrees but struggled to fill the larger 13 plate experience.",420,2

"Recommendation from an acquaintance.  Made OT dinner reservations.  We walked in from the Marketplace entrance that we were confused as to where the hostess was.  It turns out it was around the bar.  Both of the hostesses were friendly and one even complimented my dress.  We were quickly seated and was greeted by our happy server.\n\nI started the night with a red sangria.  Pretty punchy, not super fruity which I liked.  For starters, we had the Manchego Bruschetta which came with chorizo and the Mediterranean Salad.  One bruschetta is a good bite for 2 people.  The Mediterranean salad was fresh and tasty.  The dressing was a little tangy that at one point, it went down the wrong pipe and I started coughing.  For dinner, I had the English Pea Tortellini which apparently is made in-house.  The sauce was delicious with bacon and mushrooms.  MMMMmmm, I still remember the taste of it.  My husband had the Natural Chicken with potato puree.  The chicken was juicy and although it was a simple dish, it was made well.  The portions for both were just right.  Not huge, but good individual portions.  \n\nI had a paper cut and needed a band-aid so I asked the server for one.  He went to go check and never came back so I figured he forgot, but then a lady came by and offered me different types of bandaid.  Perhaps she was the GM.  I picked the one with hearts.  That was nice of them.  They did not forget.\n\nWe asked more about the restaurant and the Fox Restaurant Concepts company and our server was knowledgeable and helpful in answering questions.  The server even brought out the list of all the other restaurants that are owned by FRC.  Overall, great food, friendly staff, tasty drinks, live DJ.  Great place to go with a group.",402,4
"The food is always delicious. I have never eaten on site always order delivery. While the food is one of our favorites I have some serious complaints about the customer service. \nIt is always hard to get a hold of someone to place an order and more often then not we are left 'on hold\"" which means placed on the counter to hear everyone's conversations.. 10 min later we are usually helped and it takes quite a while for the person to take the order down.\nOne of my biggest problem with Davids is we order for the office 4 different  meal orders, all being delivered to the same location, and each order is slapped with a delivery charge. ( most other lunch spots we order from divide that fee up or only charge once.)\nIts a bummer when choosing lunch that we have started to look elsewhere so we don't have to deal with their customer service.",184,1

"This place tops my chart as the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. Having just been released from the hospital and given the okay to eat whatever I wanted, I fast tracked it to the nearest fast food joint I could find to grab a quick meal. \n\nI was initially greeted with, \""What do you want?\"" I brushed this aside despite it being overly rude and attempted to order food for my family. I say \""attempted\"" because, for the first time in my life, I didn't make it past the drive-thru speaker. \n\nWhile ordering, the lady taking my order began speaking with another employee about prices. About 15 seconds of this went on before she returned to speaking with me. \n\nHaving just waited for her to have a conversation that could've waited the 15 seconds it would have taken me to place my order, she begins speaking to me in a rushed manner. \""Do you want your combo 'this style, this style, or this style'? Size? What to drink?\"" Not only was this the icing on the cake for me, but I looked at my fiance to make sure that I wasn't in the wrong. Her look was also that of disbelief. I calmly told the lady that she was being \""f***ing rude\"" and left for what turned out to be a Burger King down the road. Despite the BK's slower than usual service, it was 10x better than what I received at this place. \n\nAll-in-all: This place marks the first time that I was unable to make it past the ordering phase at any fast food location. Considering the bad service I have received elsewhere, this place makes its way to the top of the list for worst overall. I will never return to this place.",382,0

When trying to go out the front door, we were turned away to go \""out the back\"". Then when heading to the back, asked which side we had to go out (east or west), the bouncer replied \""what the f*ck do you think?\"". I guess we interrupted him while he was holding up the counter.

It was truly a mix of Japanese and Italian.  \nI ordered the special where you get a drink, appetizer and meal for a set price. \nI got the baby octopus and Kinoko meat sauce on Fettuccini. \nThe octopus was delicious!   Perfectly cooked with a light batter.  \nThe pasta was good, but I really struggled with the Asian flavors in the dish. I think I am just too Italian infused by my family and couldn't overcome the strange flavors in my normally Italian spices only sauce.\n\nService: the service was good. That is all I have to say about that. \n\nFacility: It's a small place.  We were actually the only folks in the restaurant, but I think it sits around 40 folks. \n\nOverall review: Everyone else seed to enjoy it. Just not my thing.

My cousin asked if they had a roll with strawberries and they didnt, but about 10 minutes later the owner and sushi chef cam and asked what she was looking for. He custom made a roll for her.  We were all doing the all you can eat (I highly recc it), so to go out of his way to make a special roll even though we weren't paying more for us--was way too generous and was the icing on the cake.

"Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.\n\nI ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top).

"I have scoured the world in search of sublime authentic ramen, which has landed me in countries around the world and especially at ramen's heart of origin, Japan. \n\nSubjectively, Koto should receive no stars for its improper use of ingredients, a lackadaisical preparation process and poor value. Objectively however, Champaign Urbana is not a destination of culinary paradise either.\n\nTo provide an assessment of Koto with a point of reference of world class ramen is unfair. So on the standards of Champaign savor, measured to the likes of Chipotle, Cravings, Bangkok Thai, Torticas and the much heralded McDonalds, Koto should be correctly placed at a 1.5 rating. It is rounded up to 2 as a gesture of good will. \n\nPros\n+ Effort for attempting to replicate authentic ramen in Cornfield, Illinois\n+ Clean environment, refreshing decor\n+ Reasonable menu\n\nCons\n\n- A futile attempt at ramen replication, ironically due to the lack of effort\n- Cheap ingredients\n- Does not offer Tonkotsu broth (an important soup base in ramen derieved from pork bones and fat)\n\nMy order and assessment: Shoyu (Soy sauce) Pork Ramen\n\nThe core of ramen lies within two primary aspects, the broth and a wheat based ramen noodle. \n\nBroth is characterized by two types. The first is a lighter broth such as soy sauce. It acts as a secondary flavor to amplify the inherent taste of other ingredients used. Normally lighter broths are quite refreshing and also providing a sensation of warmness to the dish. The second is a rich broth such as Tonkotsu. It requires a lengthy preparation process as it aims to release every fraction of flavor from its soup ingredients which involves the boiling of pork bones and fat for multiple hours. This results in a broth that is rich, pungent but not overwhelming. \n\nWhat I was given instead of standard Shoyu was a cheap chicken broth that was grease ridden and no different to a 30 cent chicken soup from K-Mart. It was edible, just barely. It was not ramen broth...it was chicken soup. Cheap chicken soup. \n\nRamen noodles are the second core of a ramen bowl. To highlight the importance of the noodle, the term \""ramen\"" itself translates literally to \""pulled noodle\"". This is a noodle dish and for obvious reasons the noodle component is imperative. \n\nKoto however resorted to using a prepackaged thin ramen variant with an overwhelming egg flavor, and a lingering vile unidentifiable aftertaste.  It is acceptable to use prepackaged noodles as fresh ramen production is understandably difficult, however Koto's parsimonious noodle selection was absolutely unforgivable. It was not a far step away from our beloved Maruchan, less than 20 cents a pack, in this $11 bowl of ramen atrocity. \n\nThe pork topping was laughable. It was slices of unseasoned half cooked pork, overcooked using a blow torch (literally) and over-overcooked when sitting in the warm broth. Not much to add to lederstreifen and broken jaws. \n\nI have the full capacity to afford a $11 ramen bowl, but given the criminally low quality of ingredients used in this bowl of horror, my visit was outright robbery. \n\nThen again this is Champaign, so a very generous two stars to Koto.",723,1
"Cafe Andaluz is a perfectly respectable place to stop for a bite when you're on George St and want to fill your belly and have a long chat over some sangria.\n\nIt's not exactly going to win any culinary awards, and the scale of the place can make you feel a bit like you're being churned through a system, but the food is perfectly acceptable and the staff don't seem to mind when you stretch a few tapas over a loooooooong lunch.",103,2
"Layalina just reopened after its prior location burned to the ground a few months ago a block away. It's very good Middle Eastern food, which we've needed here in C-U for a long time. Just a tiny bit pricey for a student budget, but the portions are large. Almond rice was delicious with my chicken dish.  My friend had the lamb shewarma platter and said it was delicious. The service is cordial.",90,3

"To be succinct:\n\n$2.50 for my iced Americano - just like the menu said it would be. Of course, I had to ask where the menu was - amusing. My Americano was spot-on. I barely had to add any milk or sugar.\n\nSuch a small space with hardly any parking whatsoever. Inside, very little options when sitting. No, I don't want to sit on a wooden chair for over 2 hours, thanks. Wish this place had more plush seats. \n\nDecor is cool and relaxing. Really liked the layout and I found the bathroom to be even cool. Go fig. Service was prompt and friendly. \n\nI'd go back, yes. But only to grab and run - maybe even do the drive-thru thing. Doubt I could find an open seat inside (or a parking spot outside), so why bother?",188,2
"I just started a job over here and was happy to find a little place that's right by where I'll be working.  It was a decent sized place and when we first walked in I was worried because the line was pretty long. Well, I have to say, the line is definitely from the yumminess & price of the food because they moved us through super fast. They had alot to choose from, and I tried the chicken parmesan. The cheese was just dripping off and man it was good!! I'll definitely be back to this little place.",117,3

"I went with a group of colleagues to honey salt recently. It had great reviews and we were expecting a great experience. However, the restaurant was underprepared for a Friday noon rush on Dec 6. The wait staff was very nice and did their best to accommodate our groups demands. I believe my group understood that the restaurant was having trouble coping with an unexpectedly large crowd. The food came out over an hour later and the desserts were late, too. In the end the group's conclusion was that the food was very nicely prepared but that the manager was the least favorable part of our visit. His apologies were patronizing and unconcerned. The problem seemed to extend to small groups, too, since there were others openly complaining about wait times. Needless to say, our conference attendance for the day was badly affected and our request for acknowledgement of mistakes was met with a combative manager who must be further trained on dealing with difficult situations. If I rated the food, the grilled cheese sandwich was excellent so I would say 4 stars. The wait staff was also 4 stars. But - I firmly believe that the manager has damaged his restaurant's reputation with a group of professionals with money to spend and large ties to Las Vegas. Come alone to Honey Salt if you must, but not with groups.",263,1
"Falko's bread is great. Cakes are yummy, but expensive. This new Falko bakery and cafe is a nice place to while away some time and satisfy your sweet tooth. But at these prices you might find yourself nibbling and sipping to make it last longer!",56,2

"my first trip here, on a thursday night. a little crowded but not too bad. we were sat right away, and immediately had someone ask what we would like to drink. \n\nwe ordered a small pizza (which was actually pretty big) and just water. waited....and waited....finally wondering where our food was. all of a sudden the manager comes out and introduces herself. explains to us \""i didnt like the way your pizza was coming out, so i had them re-do it...sorry about the wait\"" apparently our pizza was cooking uneven and would have come out either mushy, or overdone. when our pizza finally did come out it was great.",140,3
"The price is good for what you get and for the convenience (if it's ready). It's not anything to write home about but it's decent for $5. When the pizza is ready, it's nice to just come in and have it already done but I find the problem is at peak times, like dinner, the pizzas aren't ready. Umm...ok? I come at dinner time and it's a 15-20 min wait for a \""hot and ready\"" pizza. I understand it's a busy time but shouldn't you take that into account and forecast how many you'll need when you are making pizzas for the peaks? Otherwise, stop calling it hot and ready when it's not! Kind of defeats the purpose of me coming to little Caesars versus a competitor. It's not like I pick this place over other pizza joints because it tastes better...",189,1
"Solid three stars for both service and food! Neither is too shabby, but it's still midrange. Decent selection of drinks as well. The portion sizes are actually really great, however, fries and salad are a bit 'over-featured' while the 'main parts' (protein) are small. The soup is pretty nice. The environment is that of an older cafe, and frequented by an older crowd, but it beats many other Montreal establishments (in that their fries are crisp (not soggy) and crunchy).",106,2
"Just wanted to give a shout out to the Florist at this location. It is down the road a piece from my apartment and this is quite simply the best and biggest Fry's Marketplace in the entire state of Arizona....if not the Country. She hooked me up with a great corsage for my wife.....and I didn't give here many details except that I wanted Cali lily's and they had to be white. She asked me a couple of questions about my wife's dress and the rest as the say was history. I returned a couple of hours later and there was my beautiful corsage waiting for me to give to my beautiful wife. \n\nWhile this may not be the cheapest place to shop for your groceries....they do have everything from the covered parking outside......to the free valet parking as well. Wine and Cheese bars.....to cooking class stations. Massive deli department......to massive bakery area. The aisles are spacious.....the self checkouts are a must try.....and the customer service is top notch. When your leaving they even have a Redbox for you to rent movies if your into that kind of thing as well. Don't let me forget what I started this review with......the Florist Department.....simply great and I will be back for all my flower needs in the future. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",279,4
"Be forewarned, he is not a G rated hypnotist.  Anthony Cools show was great.  He was very clever in that while waiting for the show to start there is an interesting 3D movie playing on the screen behind the stage.  This is an R rated movie.  It was very funny at times so make sure you get there when the doors open as you will be entertained.\n\nThis is a show that is truly dependent on audience participation.  The audience for the show I was at was probably on 65-75% full so I was concerned on how participation was going to be (I rather watch :)).  He had about 25 chairs on stage and 14 volunteers.  A few were thanked for their participation and asked to return to their seats as it was clear they were not \""going under\"".  \n\nOnce everyone that he felt were under were under the real fun began.  The things he relayed to the hypnotized were hilarious and very clever.  He plays to the personalities of all on stage and truly gets into them.  \n\nOne funny thing that he did was with a guy named Mark.  Every time Anthony said his name Mark would do something (not going to tell you what he did you would need to see the show!).  Anthony was saying something was his trademark and I think it was unintentional, but he said Mark, and Mark did what he was commanded to do an Anthony was completely unaware until the audience was in hysterics.  \n\nEvery show is different, it truly is dependent on who is willing to participate and willing to make a fool of themselves.  What happens here stays here, unless you buy the DVD of the performance ;)  \n\nThis show is highly recommended!",373,3
With ingredients like prosciutto and burrata on the menu I would be pretty surprised if anything tasted less than delicious. I'm super happy that they offer all of my favorite goodies to put on my pizzas! Pizza Brutta could take it to the next level (and star) by crafting slightly more creative flavor combinations for their on-the-menu pizzas or improving the crust consistency just a bit (I'm picky though). \n\nI like how fast my order comes out.,99,3
"The company scheduled its next two regional meetings at this resort.  I say resort because it's in the name of the establishment.  As a resort, it's not very special.  As a lodge for corporate meetings the Scottsdale Plaza Resort is a good place to meet.\n\nWe had over 100 participants in our two-day meeting and the entire event was a success because of the service and professionalism of the staff.  The meeting rooms were well-suited for our needs and everything--from the group meals to the between session snacks to the late night drinks--was first class.  All of the support--audio visual, room service, concerge--we recevied enabled us to put our best foot forward and promote our company without any distractions.\n\nBecause of the unexpected, record-breaking cold snap, we were unable to enjoy the grounds and pools of the facility.  I'd like to come back when it's warmer and enjoy the great outdoors Scottsdale has to offer.  We did spend a few hours in the exercise room.  There are weight machines, dumbells, treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, a rowing machine and other equipment in what used to be two racquetball courts.  Despite having a sizable group of people using the facility, I never had a wait.\n\nOur room for three nights was a bi-level villa.  We entertained several of the corporate dignitaries in the spacious living area down below.  There were two, well-appointed bathrooms--one upstairs and one down.  With the freezing temperatures outside, the fireplace in the room kept us warm and comfortable.  The one disappointment was the lack of an mp3 player in the room.  While I was entertaining, it would've been nice to have had my iPod creating the mood.\n\nWe did have two problems during our stay.  Our first room was a bilivel with two full-size beds upstairs and a noisy family with young children next store.  To avoid sleeping in separate beds, my spouse and I moved to a bilevel King the next day.  One big bed with a little peace and quiet diverted what could have been a scathing yelp review.  \n\nFinally, for some reason, we were locked out of the wifi server at the hotel.  We spent an hour with AT&T in an attempt to resolve the problem before giving up in frustration.  The next day, we had no problem logging in to the wifi.  For a yet-to-be-discovered reason, the server at the hotel would not allow us to log on that night and the IT staff were long gone.\n\nIf I had to pay the price for this \""resort\"" I might have been disappointed.  But on the company's nickle for the company's purpose,  it's adequate.  I've experienced much worse--but I've also experienced much better.",611,2
"I must preface this by saying we only ate here because we were starving and everything else in the hotel closed to prepare for dinner.  \n\nWhen I walked in, I thought the place looked promising seeing the decanters of dried noodles (which ok, follows the decor) but then i realized that these dried noodles probably leave their decanters and actually make it to our plates!  Not really, but I thought with a name called noodles, it would taste well homemade.  Boy was I mistaken.\n\nWe started our meal off with the potstickers.  I've had better from Ling's that I make myself and for $15, it was bad.  Then, I started sipping my $4 ice tea.  $4 for what tasted like used bathwater.  Yuck,\n\nWe then choked down the sweet and spicy noodles, which after dressing up with some soy sauce and more hot sauce didn't taste that bad.  But, for $50 for lunch, you can say Overratted.",220,1
"Molly had a stand at the Westgate farmers' market, and I tried one of her (full-size!) samples of red pork. It was very tasty and moist, if not as spicy as I would like. She did say that you can request that your dozen be made spicier. \n\nIt was also really full of meat. She also said that she only uses really good cuts of meat, and no lard.\n\nHowever, I passed on buying a dozen, as I thought $26 was a little high, and I wanted to try some more elsewhere.",121,2
"Upscale Chilis.  Food is decent, though I was fooled when I ordered a wrap expecting a tortilla wrap and instead got flat bread.  It was still very good, but I wonder what else isn't mentioned on the menu.  Great fries, great service, love the booths.",61,2
"I have had Rudy's in NM, it was so good!  Pre-Yelp days.  I was excited to hear that they are in AZ.  \n\nThe lines at 5:30pm were already 1 hour+ long.  After you wait and wait, you need to find a spot to sit with all your goodies.  Got the 1/2 lbs of brisket (moist), a little dry but the table side BBQ sauce fixed that up.  The 1/2 lbs of baby back ribs = 5 ribs was dry and the BBQ sauce could not save that one.  The small order of new potatoes was really really small (about 10 small chucks) & tasteless and the corn on the cob was great.  The sweet  tea is out of this world.  And they forgot to give me bread.",180,2
"I have been to Lucky Strikes a couple times, it is located on the second floor of Cityscape in downtown Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, last time I came with a serious beast-like hunger and I had every intention  of shamelessly stuffing my face with lots of delicious bar food as soon as I sat down. I  ordered the nachos and the mini bacon cheese burgers. Lets just say both dishes were mundane and anticlimactic at best. The nachos left me extremely unsatisfied and wanting to run to Filberto's on my way home! \nOn a more positive note, the place looks very cool, modern trendy and pretty large.  It does seem good for parties and bigger groups. If bowling is your thing, I'd say this place is worth checking out but don't come for the food. just saying.",170,1
"I live five blocks from this store and I usually will drive the five miles out of my way to go to the one at the waterfront.  This place is small, but that isn't the issue.  It's two stars based purely on shopping experience.  This location has a bus stop at the edge of it's parking lot and it seems to attract a certain type of clientele.  Loud and obnoxious, completely uncontrolled children. The majority of the cashiers are miserable unless they are yelling across registers to each other about their personal lives or when they are taking their next break..  I've been yelled at by the jitney drivers that occupy the side of the lot for taking \""their\"" parking spaces.   The summertime \""freegans\"" or traveler kids like to hang out over by the redbox and I've seen at least a couple of them making that corner their personal toilet.   Panhandlers ask for cigarettes as you walk in the door.  Giant Eagle does not seem to care who camps out on their property, and this is the main flaw at this location.  Ghetto Bird indeed.",229,1
"This place was fantastic, but they changed there sauce and now it's just mediocre. The sauce has little garlic flies in it. I ordered the pan pizza little to no sauce on it. I thought it was more. I think that now it's just over priced. I don't think I'll be ordering from here again unless something changes",73,1
"Citizens is a fairly new restaurant on the Strip, located at the Mandalay.  I believe it opened earlier this year...\n\nLike many new restaurants at the higher end casinos, the interior is re-done and has an upscale feel.  Service here was fantastic--our server was very accomodating to our unusual requests, and he was speedy.\n\nHow was the food?  Hmmm... I ordered one of their signature items: the meatball grinder (meatball, gravy, and provolone sandwich).  It was missing something... I would start with a thicker gravy with some added punch.  In any case, I got the feeling their recipe was missing a key ingredient(s) and was real close to being perfect--meatballs had decent flavor, lots of provolone, and good, soft bread...

I think I'm just not a muffaletta person as the sandwich didn't connect with me.  Visually, it did look good though...\n\nWith both sandwiches failing to wow me, great service and good decor isn't enough to woo a return visit from me... =(",311,2
"If you blink you will miss it. So in that essence it fits the \""hole in the wall\"" category. The parking however doesn't seem to be a problem since there is a lot if street parking all around the empty neighborhood. Inside the restaurant is a whole different story... It is alive with all the sounds of hustle and bustle coming from the open kitchen area and the echoing sounds of the warehouse style seating area coming from all the seated patrons. In short it's loud in here, definitely lively but wouldn't suggest this place if you are planning on having a conversation. The service is amazing so much so I thought at one point I had three servers since more than one person came to check on us. Now to the food. I ordered the downtown egg Benedict and there famous pancake and my husband had the two egg special. The plating of both were beautiful and the portions were generous but the flavors were not very memorable. Overall from a score of 1-10 I give  this place a 5",207,2

This circle k sucks. They always have some bullshit reason to be closed late night posted on the locked front door. And it so conveniently happens to be when I get off work at 2am. Clerks are slow and will chat with the person in front of you when there's a huge line behind them. Avoid circle k and go to QT,71,1
"The only reason I've gone to the Fremont is for their drink specials, which I believe are $2 Coronas, Heinekens, margaritas, and shots of Jaeger.

I've never stayed here or eaten here, and I doubt that I ever will.  The end.",98,2
"I liked this place when it was a Zellers,\nit's now under the Walmart Banner, I don't know why people would come here if there's another one 5 minutes away.\n\nThe only good thing is that it's less busy than the others and thus less headache inducing.\n\nYou find what you want, and exit out, very depressing experience that I try to limit as much as possible.\n\nThe only good thing is that having a Walmart here lessens the likelihood of having one near where I live",115,1
Staff was very busy.  Food was okay.  Would not go here on purpose.,19,1
"Another pleasurable and fabulastic stay in MO. Though the hotel is not really centrally located on the LV strip, nevertheless it is closer to the airport and a real hedonistic treat. Upon entry, this hotel immediately invokes zen and classy vibe. I love the sweet-zen scent of the whole hotel (from the lobby all the way to our room). This is an absolute treat especially after coming back from a smoking Casino Hotel. This hotel is one of the few that does not have a casino on the strip. Definitely no ordinary Las Vegas hotel. The hotel lobby is situated oddly on the 23rd floor which is steps away from the hotel's impressive tea lounge and world class bar. Of course they would be reviewed separately. \n\nAs for the room, it was a wonderful treat. Modern, asian motiff, hi-tech and chic. The curtains, temperature and tv are all controlled electronically by the small monitor/clock on the bedside. Oh lala. The linen, is a heavenly refuge: soft and smooth perfect to cradle your weary body. The bathroom is roomy and sexy. Firstly, who does not love the very modern bath tub equipped with bath salt and adorned with rose petals. The tub itself is also nicely located so you can enjoy bathing and watch the small tv affixed on the vanity mirror at the same time. \""Fancy indeed.\"" Secondly, the rain shower head in the walk in shower is just soothing and lovely. My husband loves them so much he spends 30 minutes there. Thirdly, the separate toilet and sink is a great idea for personal privacy while the modern double sink is elegant. Hoah! the cute jewelry box filled with luxurious and sweet scented amenities. \n\nDid I mention that they have the so called \""valet cabin.\"" It is located right by the door and it is where you can drop your shoes for shining, clothes to be dry cleaned and so forth. This is apparently to preserve you privacy and maximize your restful stay.\n\nFurthermore, you must not miss out delighting yourself on the inviting pool deck, poolside cabana and relaxing jacuzzi. All these feels right after a good workout in the fitness room or treatment from the world renowned spa. \n\nWhat a delightful place to stay in Las Vegas.",464,4
"Absolutely terrible. \n\nHaving been to the location in Milpitas CA and Jillians in Charlotte, NC. i had high hopes. Its nice to be able to act like an overgrown child without having to contend with kids running around everything. (Both of the other places didn't let underage kids in after 5pm.)\n\nYet I come here, and its like I was walking into a Chuck E Cheese with beer. Kids running around all over the place, playing on all the stuff I wanted to play. Finally get to play whatever, and some parent is standing over your shoulder because their kid wants in. I don't hate kids or anything, but damn. The food and drinks absolutely cannot make up for how much the place sucks. \n\nTheir game selection is also wanting, but I've said enough.",177,0
i purchase a cake today for my for my friends birthday a marble cake with birthday decoration on the top. I was extremely  disappointed. First This was definitely a BOX CAKE.  Nothing about this cake scream that  got it from a well know bakery. it taste ver similar to Sam's club cakes.  The cakes are over price for the quality and the decoration seem like a child wrote his name on the cake. this is my third time trying them and i must  say this is the last.,104,1
"Orchid Garden is a thing of the past. Ping Pang Pong's dim sum is far superior!\n\nI would much prefer coming here because of the nicer ambiance and better quality food. Seems like Orchid is going downhill for my taste. They serve everything here for what is seemingly cheaper and better tasting. Word to the wise though, as with all dim sum places, come well before 1:30pm or else they'll be fresh out of everything. They refused to make any more dim sum items after that point.",109,3
"Generally, the food is okay.  Not bad, but not particularly good.  \n\nHowever, the service was awful.  We had to wait 30 minutes to get a table for five, and even after they seated us, it took them another 10 minutes to bring the menu.  We ordered six dishes.  They came out one at a time, which seems a little absurd -- we eat family-style, fortunately so we shared, but what would have happened if we ordered our own dishes for ourselves?  \n\nThe waiter/waitress was slow at refilling water and bringing us plates.  We ordered a large soup to share -- it didn't get to the table till the very end, and they even neglected to bring bowls and spoons.  Really, the food was okay, and it took almost two hours to eat because the service was so slow.  \n\nMy family is from Taiwan, and the dishes were not spectacular -- very average, in my opinion.\n\nBased on this first impression, we will not return.",226,1
"Have you ever had a food craving that just took over?  Today was one of those days.  I wanted pasta and I wasn't going to stop until I got some.  As I was driving home I passed a car with the license plate \""Maru\"" which reminded me of the YouTube celebrity kitty from Japan.  Then once home I began searching yelp trying to find my perfect Pasta fix. When I stumbled upon Maru's I thought it was a funny coincidence but the reviews of fresh pasta got me hooked, plus they offered a check in special.  So with lightening speed I hurried on over there with my boyfriend. \n\nWe were greeted immediately and the service was very attentive and friendly.  I changed my order after looking over the menu and it was handled with graciousness and charm. Finally decided on cannelloni stuffed with spinach and ricotta served with tomato sauce and my bf got the Quatro formaggio. Both were prepared fresh and tasted delicious. My cannelloni was like a cloud of yumminess. Perfect.  I'll definitely be going back to try the rest of their menu.",230,4
I met with Mike a few months ago and he helped me choose some flooring for my home.

"While living in Tempe for school I made several trips out to Vegas. Obviously getting out of boring old Phoenix was a must, but I am talking about driving all the way just for Rincon De Buenos Aires.\n\nThis place has great variety especially to those unfamiliar with Argentine cuisine. Their empanadas were exactly how I remember them to be when I lived down in Argentina. \n\nI was so over joyed when I learned that the owners made their own chimichurri sauce. I ordered pretty much one of many things and a bunch of empanadas. All of the stuff I had was great.\n\nI would love to make another visit soon.",137,3
"I wanted to love this place so bad. Everything looked so good and I thought for sure it would've been an instant hit. The vinegar based bbq over powers everything. It's too much. I've had other BBQ pulled porks and beef brisket it wasn't as strong as what I tasted. Server was fast. I didn't like the fact I had to help an older woman because the server didn't understand what she wanted to eat. Once I gave her my advice she then ordered. But, after she walked away the server started to make fun of the older woman. That wasn't very nice. The puppies were spot on along with the beans. Fried pickle was good too. I had to leave 1/4 pound of the 1 pound plate behind because I could not finish. Overall, with service, food prep, and some pretty good side dishes. 3 Stars at best. I did want to do more but I couldn't enjoy the meats.",204,2

"This place doesn't even deserve the one star. I should've known better and saved my friends and I from eating here when I was about to check in on my phone but we were hungry and wanted to eat ASAP. First off, horrible service! My friend specifically asked for something to be not on her food and they messed up the order! When my food came it was freezing cold. I never complain about food being cold but honestly, my food felt as though it was placed in the fridge for an hour so I sent back my food to get reheated. I could tell it was reheated and just sat there before it was served to me again because the tortillas for my tacos were dry and crunchy yet the meat was still cold! I didn't wanna waste anymore time here so I decided to shut up and just eat the horrible quality meat. The chorizo was okay, but the chicken tasted fake to me, yuck. Mind you our food took forever to come out! The manager was kind enough to give us free chips and salsa... guess I'll give the one star to the manager. Other than that, this place needs to seriously work on management and food quality.\n\nOh yeah, all of our waters were empty for a good 20-35 minutes and nobody came by to refill our drinks so I literally got up and found a pitcher of water and refilled all of our drinks. Customers shouldn't be doing that!!",298,0
"What a lovely place to stroll.  For the most part I can't afford to do more than window shop.  I have spent some time more than once on the \""patio\"" of Fat Tuesdays drinking a margarita and watching the Atlantis show and I bought a birthday present cap at the now gone Ferrari store.",64,3
"Too bad I can't give this place zero stars. The only people that actually say good things about this place are just family members of the owners and friends of the owners. The absolute worst service me and my girlfriend have EVER received at a beauty salon. First they are completely rude to us while they're working on my girlfriend's hair and then they over charge us money when it clearly says that hair cuts are $5 and get completely defensive when we call them out on it.

"Yes, I'm writing a review for an \""adult\"" store, don't judge me. Okay, you can judge me, but if you visit The Love Store, your judgment will likely be a positive one! I'd passed this store a number of times, but never was so inclined to visit until it was 2:45pm on Halloween, and I didn't have a costume. Yes, I could have just gone to Party City or something like that, but the parking lot was packed, and I knew everything was going to be picked over.... So, I made an impulsive decision to stop into The Love Store.\n\nWOW! This place was absolutely beautiful. And big, and clean, and well-stocked. It was pretty darn amazing! They had TONS of costumes, ranging in price, size, and style, and I found one that suited me perfectly. The employees were really friendly and knowledgable, without being pushy at all.  It is a place where women and couples can feel comfortable- not at all seedy or \""ick\"" inducing.  \n\nWhen I arrived at the register, the clerk let me know that costumes were buy one, get one 1/2 off, and walked me out to show me which ones qualified. He was really, really nice, and even showed me some pictures of real people dressed in the costumes. \n\nAlthough I spent more than I anticipated, I didn't regret it at all, because the costume really was high quality and looked great. I wish I'd had more time to browse, because I could see all kinds of clothing, lingerie, shoes, toys, and everything else you could think of in this type of store. I will definitely be back, because I think I'm in  LOVE! :)",377,4
"My daughter and I had a 7 pm reservation last night. We arrived and were offered a seat at a two top right next to the door. It was very cold so I asked for a different table. The seemingly too bored to care hostess said the only other option was also by a door, despite there being MANY open tables. We sat and were ignored for about 10-12 minutes before a bus boy dropped a basket of icy cold, dry baguette slices on our table and told us the compound butter this evening was \""orange poppy seed\"" (sweet). We waited another 10 minutes without anyone giving us a word or a glance, despite several waitstaff walking by our table several times. We got up and left without anyone saying a word. My daughter realized she left her purse and went back to get it. A waiter was standing near our table and he looked at her questioningly but still not a word. I don't know whether we were ignored because we were two women, or they have bad service generally, or it was just a bad night. We walked over to La Bocca and were welcomed beautifully and served a delicious meal (see review). When next in town, we will revisit La Bocca (a house of treats for us) but not House of Tricks.",264,0
"I wanted something different for lunch, so I checked out the menu here and everything looked delicious. I ordered their Crazy Gyro Salad (which has no lettuce)....but man, it was super tasty. Nothing over the top incredible, just darn good food. I gave them an extra star because they were super helpful and extremely nice. Oh, and try their Sangria....very refreshing on a hot afternoon!",81,3
Food is very good. Have been here a few times and the service is lacking every time. They are very slow and made mistakes throughout our visit. Hopefully they can get it together. Soon!!,40,1
"Good place to work out, but OMG if you have problems with their finance department!  I had a membership tied to a debit card and had no problems.  My husband had his attached to his military bank card.  When he had problems with his bank card,  he got a new one.  He called.  He went in.  He could never get it changed.  After some time, he gave up and thought they would just bill him.  Fast forward several years and they sent him to collections.  When he called the finance department to try and get it straightened out, they wanted twice the contract, not even giving him credit for what he did pay.  I looked over the contract (while not rushed by a sales person) and discovered that it was a finance contract, meaning that you purchased two years of services from them and your payment plan is for two years.  Thus, even if you do not receive two years of service from them, you still have to pay them for two years.  \nNo matter what they offer, I will never sign another contract with them again.  DO NOT GO THERE.  There are other places in town.",241,1
We were told that the wait was only 15-20 minutes and we ended up waiting for 45 minutes!!! We were all just waiting there while others that just arrived passed us by. I finally decided to complain and that's when they finally put their heads together and set-up a table for us. Worst place for a Sunday Brunch! Food was ok...not worth the wait.,83,0
I used AAA Painters to paint the exterior of my home recently.  David and his crew did a great job.  Their prep work was impressive.  They even fixed a number of drywall cracks we had before priming and painting.  They finished earlier than expected and I am completely satisfied with the workmanship.,62,4
"I've been to some really clean and really dirty laundromats and Magic Wash falls somewhere in the middle.\n\nThey have a lot of washers and dryers which means you never have to wait. They even have wi-fi and big screen televisions to keep you entertained.\n\nA nice kicker is they are about 100 feet away from Fatburger. \n\nI went here once, but I think I will look for another place first before I visit again.",101,2
"This subway sucks. Its pretty clean and all but the girl who always ends up making my sub does a horrible job. Sometime i wonder how hard it can honestly be to make a tuna sub, but for some reason she appears to have a difficult time. The first time i went i just let her do her thing, but after getting home and eating my sub must of the bites were sauce, veggies and bread, no tuna. Every other subway i go to spreads the tuna with a knife just like they do with everything else but i guess not this one. So the last few times i went in i specifically asked her to spread it with a knife, she said okay and looked for one. After looking for 3 seconds and not finding one she just continued to make my sub with 3 big globs of tuna. Might sound ridiculous but its not that hard to find a knife and do your job the right way.",186,0
I had an iced americano and a cookie with jelly on it that was amazing! I liked the crowd and thought the inside looked awesome! I would definitely go back!,34,3
"Just had the craziest experience. My mom had called the store asking for a certain person who worked there (our order was messed up before and we were told that we would be comped the next visit). Immediately the \""owner\"" Carrie yelled \""Jason doesn't work here!\"" and slammed the phone on my mom. In complete disbelief, we called again and this Carrie lady yells \""I told you there is no Jason here! Were too busy to deal with this.\"" And slammed us again. We decided to take a stroll to this location and we were greeted nicely (not one person was in this store, must be pretty busy), and once my mom asked to talk to the owner Carrie knew who we were. She screamed at us saying were not welcome and that they're too busy, running out dough, and product. There was a huge scene caused by this Carrie woman and I have never been treated so rudely in my entire life. We've been to this location HUNDREDS of times and never once did we encounter something like this. I wouldn't even give this place one star.",225,0
"I had high expectations for the Bellagio buffet due to the numerous amounts of people who say its one of the best buffets in town.  So we gave it a try. \n\nWait staff: like most buffets, they come around and clean your empty plates, fill you drinks and answer any other questions you might have. So I wouldn't say they are the most friendliest since they are running around like mad. Our waitress was nice though.\n\nFood: Well, this is were the review really goes down hill. The steaks tasted like poor cuts of meat or if the meat going bad. It was not tender. We tried the prime rib. This was not too bad. everything else was either bland, tasteless or dried out. One of my friends resorted to eating cookies and drinking milk to fill up.\nThe King crab legs were not very fresh tasting either.\nThe Bok Choy had bits of sand / sediment still lodged in its leaf. \nWhile we were there, at least 7-8 tables of people left within 10-15 mins of sitting down due to the disappointment of the buffet. \nI am truly sorry I could not give it more than 1 start for such a beautiful Hotel/Casino. Maybe it was an off day for the start or maybe they had food issues that transferred to our meal.\n\nI highly doubt I will go back to give them a 2nd chance when there are other buffets in Vegas to try.\n\nPrice: At about $35 a person, its very expensive when you consider the quality of the meal\n\nOverall: My advice is beware, it may not be as good as everyone touts it to be. Since you are in Vegas, you Will be taking a gamble on whether it will be good or not.\n\nGood Luck and Bon Appettie.",391,0
"Won't ever come back here.  The security guards are pricks, the place was too small and the drinks were ok.  The highlight of my night was the one bartender who hooked up an extra dose of patron for my friend and I.  Other than that, this place was mediocre at best.",64,0
"Truffle Fries!!  Wow!  I am only writing a review on the total ambiance and bar menu.  I didnt actually get a chance to sit down and have dinner but that will inevitably happen soon.  The location and atmosphere is simply wonderful.  We sat inside at the bar on a Friday during happy hour and things started jumping.  Not jumping like packed and annoying, just enjoyable with people all over the place.  The bartender/staff was very attentive and very good at her job.  That is nice.  Just outside is a large patio area over looking a beautiful courtyard in the city.  Great location!  \n\nTruffle fries.... Now, the only other fries that I have ever had that didnt require and condiments were at Capital Grille.  They were $10 fries.  They are $4 here and simply delicious.  I will be going back many times to this place just for those fries (see picture).  Also stay tuned for update about the dinner menu.  Very soon.   Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M.",220,3
"Probably one of the nicest clubs in Las Vegas, or anywhere.  Came here on saturday 10/02.  Girls had to pay $20 cause we came with so many guys, who paid $50.  It was worth it though cause the club was so beautiful.  Half inside and half outside by the pool and bars all over. I LOVED the DJ there, who played mostly house mixes!  I love house, but if you're not into that, you may want to go somewhere else.  Girls (and some guys) were taking their shoes off and dancing in the water.  That's not my thing, I think it's pretty gross, especially putting your heels back on afterwards, but if your feet are killing you, it's the best!  It was fun dancing, it felt roomy, but towards 2am they let way too many people in and it felt like everyone was shoulder to shoulder.  I felt like I had no room to dance and I was just moving back and forth trying not to step on anyone, lol. Overall, fun place!",229,4
"Ri Ra is one of the coolest bars in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be. \n\nWhat I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment. \n\nStick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.",167,1
"Stopped here the other night for a quick late night dinner to share with my boyfriend. I got the philly cheese steaks with grilled onions, plus tomato and lettuce- which was 6.99 a sandwich. Each was a very light, fluffy, toasted roll filled with lots of cheese plus grilled beef and onions with a few slices of tomato and leaves of romaine. Not an extraordinary sandwich but an easy solution after a late work night. They offer chicken wings, fingers, salads, warm and cold sandwiches, pizza and different pastas. Reminds me of you standard neighborhood pizza joint. \n\nPro: Open late, if not 24 hours! Yay for people who work late for me having yet another option for food.\n\nCon: Food seems overpriced for what it is. Not a sit-down restaurant,  the decor is more suited to waiting for a quick pizza to go. \n\nOnce I try the pizza I'll give it a more in depth review, but so far I'm not planning a return trip any time soon. It filled my belly but wasn't crave worthy for me.",232,1
"A quant little spot I decided to check out before hitting Fresh Market. It is family run business where the employees seem to know their regulars. It is definitely a New York style deli with a large selection of breakfast items, and true deli sandwiches and homemade chicken noodle soup. I went with a cup of noodle soup and the tuna melt. The soup had great flavor and is definitely homemade! As for the tuna, fresh and delicious. It came with a side and pickle. I will definitely make it there for brunch another time.",106,2
"I hated this place. It looks like a nice first date restaurant but the food and price are so not worth it. The hot tofu soup was pitiful and my fiance ordered the bbq and a sushi which were both too expensive for their own good and the sushi tasted like something was old....Never again! Chodang, here I come!",68,1
"Pretty tasty, simple, and fairly quick.\nTuna please.\nDon't come into this location at lunch cuz it's a madhouse with all the local businesses and the specialty college across the road.\nAny other time the location seems to be rather quiet, a couple of cars in the lot and maybe three customers inside.\nThe options are plentiful and I like that.\nNot exactly sure why they tear the bread OUT of the loaf and throw it away.  Talk about throwing away money.  They need to quit that practice unless the customer specifies that's what they want.  Or is that the big selling point of the Jimmy John's subs???\nCrazy that it takes four or five people to put together one sandwich but I guess they've got the system down to a science and that's why they can say they're fast.\nIn general, I like the sandwiches and they're a good change from Subway or any of the other area sandwich shops.",205,2

Placed a to go order for tri tip and spicy smoked sausage. They said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up after 20 minutes and the hostess acted as if she had no idea how to ring me up or ring up what I ordered. That part wasn't the problem but training your staff properly is always a good idea. My food was cold and the portions was extremely small for the $32 that I was charged. I live 2 minutes away from Red Rock casino and will drive to Famous Dave's next time.,115,1
"It's a bar. There's some sand. Some waitresses are more concerned about their looks than their customer service skills. It's just a typical, average, North Scottsdale bar.\n\nThe location is highly convenient, and there's never a line to get in. Even when this place is packed, it doesn't feel that packed. They have ample room inside and out so you never feel squished. It's usually pretty easy to find a table but it's definitely not as easy to find a waitress/waiter that wants to serve you, especially when it gets crowded. During one of our many Sandbar visits, our waitress was so MIA that one of the security guards started acting as our waiter... It was pretty funny to say the least.   \n\nWhen I used to live up in N. Scottsdale, Matt and I would come here for NFL Sunday football all the time. They were also pretty accommodating when it came to changing the channel so that each of us could watch our favorite teams. I always requested the 49ers, and Matt needed to see his SeaChickens. They would even change the channel for our friend, a die-hard Buffalo Bills fan (yes, they still exist), without thinking twice. I truly appreciate a bar that accommodates fans of different teams outside of the one that happens to be playing the Cardinals that week.\n\nThis is also a fun place for Happy Hour Mon-Fri. They have great specials, and the drinks get the job done. As far as bar food goes, Sanbar's menu isn't amazing but it isn't horrific either. There have been may times when I've made a meal out of their bottomless bucket of chips and salsa. As far as the crowd goes, it's kinda random. You'll see groups of coworkers enjoying some after work brews, lots of out-of-towners, young 20-somethings getting their drink on, old creepy guys with fake tans. But for the most part, this place turns into a party scene at night. Although I am totally not a UFC fan at all, Sandbar hosts a lot of UFC nights where they put the game on the big screen projector TV, and people can reserve seats/tables in advance... just as an FYI for all of you UFC people out there. \n\nI know what to expect from Sandbar, and it's an A-OK place in my book. I'd recommend it to anyone in N. Scottsdale looking for a fun, reasonably priced bar for happy hour or a night out. However, this just isn't a bar that I would drive out of my way to get to.",560,2
"The megaformer workout is incredible, and so are Gracie and Noelle.  They helped me get back in shape after having a baby, and even though I sometimes curse them in class for pushing us so hard, they really get results.  I have taken pilates for many years, and at several different studios in Vegas and I actually drive out of my way to come here - for megaformer, which you can't get anywhere else in town, and because I really enjoy everyone involved, from the owners and teachers to everyone else taking the class. They also have a ton of classes all day long so it is easy to find one that fits my often crazy schedule.",136,4

The menu for Anthony's was promising.  And to be fair one just had the burgers one would be fine, however this one had more.  The Ahi appetizer was not good.  The coconut shrimp had a ill conceived pineapple salsa.  \n\nThe beer selection is very good, the Burgers are very good the service is excellent.  Stick to the burgers and you will be fine.  Regrettably the fries were also disappointing.",135,2
"The price is right, but Shark Reef was pretty underwhelming none-the-less. This would be a wonderful pick to take the kids, but as an adult, I feel like I've seen this small aquarium theme done a hundred times AND done a lot better. \n\nThere were less than a handful of exhibits that my twenty-something year old party enjoyed. The sting ray, starfish/octopus, and shipwreck room ONLY because of the shark with the saw-nose are worth seeing. Every thing else was, frankly, kind of boring and non-impressive.\n\nOn a sad note, the huge sea turtle that was in the shipwreck room tank seemed really unhappy and was stuck behind a gate. I hope Shark Reef examines it's living situation and makes improvements. It almost brought me to tears.",168,1
"Nice and pretty hotel and casino.\n\nWe didn't stay here, but we visited the casino. It was nice, airy, and smells wonderful. However, the security guard at the front entrance was a jerk. It wasn't a busy night, he stood right at the entrance, we were kinda lost.

The scrambled eggs were a bit watery, but everything else was cooked well.\n\nParking on a Saturday was fine.

Why not have both? Hmm whatever I guess. They brought out a buttermilk pancake :( nooo sir, red velvet. I know this wasn't my error because I've heard nothing but wonderful things about their red velvet & was looking forward to trying them. Server kindly took it back & brought back the red velvet one. No biggy it happens. \nNow don't get me wrong it was alright. Pretty tastey but i'll be honest, I enjoy iHops red velvet a heck of a lot better. Personal preference though. This just wasn't sweet enough.  \nLike I said, nothing special about this place, very standard cafe with ok prices.",209,2

"Our first time to this place was not memorable at all. We walked in and wondered about with no hostess paying any attention. Finally I asked her, if we can sit in the bar. She waived us which direction to go, no offering take us there, or offering menus. We sat at the bar table for about 15 minutes and at least ten waiters, bus boys passed by us without any acknowledgement. So, we got up and walked out. Again, hostess did not say a word.

When we walked in a waiter was on the couch watching the TV over the bar. (I don't think it's really that professional, but hey, at first I just told myself I was being a jerk, but once we had eaten paid and were leaving, he was STILL there!

You can see everything they are doing, which I tend to like. \n\nThe gentleman working there (Owner?) was extremely friendly. He asked if I had eaten there before. When I said no, he asked it I eat Asian food often and If I would need assistance deciding what to eat.

"I USED to be a big fan of Pep Boys but now they have lost a customer for LIFE.\n\nAll I wanted was four new tires mounted and balanced. Not too tough. I set a 5:30pm appointment for the following evening (yesterday, 08/29/2014) and showed up right on time. I gave my keys to the guy at the counter, signed the paperwork and was told it would be ready in one to one and a half hours. No problem. \n\nI scanned all the aisles in the store doing several laps. I kept looking into the service area and saw my car sitting there but really couldn't see what was happening. At 7:17, I because apprehensive, so walked around to the big doors, only to find that the service man was JUST THEN putting my car on the rack!  I asked, \""Are you just now starting to work on my car??!!??\""  He looked exasperated and started to apologize. I cut him off and said to shut it down; I'll take my car elsewhere.\n\nWhen I went inside to confront the guy at the counter who--incidentally--had been napping with head-in-arms at the counter--he started to apologize.  TOO LATE.  I'm already pissed as can be. No explanations at this point will do any good whatsoever. To make me wait an hour and 45 minutes just to find out that the car hadn't been TOUCHED was as offensive to me as it gets.\n\nI told him that I wanted my car ... now.

"This review is for the lunch buffet.  I'm a definite fan of eating at buffets.  If I could, I would give this place a 3.5 stars. After reading the reviews, it seems to get a range of ratings here.  I had a good experience: no wait, saw the February special $7.99 with Palms Club card (normally $11.99), fast service, clean, helpful staff and variety of food to choose from. Some items were a bit on the drier side (chicken), but otherwise it looked like they provided fresh foods.  This also included wine.  The food isn't spectacular however it's not so bad either.",145,2
"So I'm new to waxing, never thought I'd actually do it.  However I'm not new to \""man-scaping\"" and I've gotten to the point where I'm fed up with trimming/shaving.  So after some serious consideration and talking to my wife about it, I figured I'd give it a shot.  Worst case, I wouldn't do it again.\n\nWell suffice to say, while yes it's pretty uncomfortable, sometimes a bit painful, it wasn't as bad as I thought.  Maren was super professional and did a fantastic job on my first ever \""bro-zilian\"".\n\nShe was great, asked if I was uncomfortable or needed to stop if it seemed I was in too much pain.  She also made me feel completely relaxed and kept up a nice casual conversation which believe it or not helped distract me with some of the discomfort.  She followed up after the appointment with care instructions and to let her know if there was anything a miss in the days ahead (ingrown hair, etc).\n\nI wouldn't think I'd dig it but honestly came out great and now Maren has a brand new regular client.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend Maren to do any or all of your man-scaping - Brazilian waxing, was very well priced and professional.

"One of my new favorite pizza places.  People have been recommending this place since I moved Downtown, and I am glad I finally decided to take a few friends there for dinner.

Only down side for a vegetarian - double check the menu descriptions (lots of prosciutto).",90,3
"Boyfriend and I come here just about every sunday. We get our coffees from the starbucks next door and breakfast from empire bagels. They are pretty good only 2 things could be better\n\n1.. the last few times my breakfast bagel sandwhiches have been burnt \n2.. I feel like the place could be a little nicer, I haven't really ever seen anything disgusting but it does look a little dusty around there.\n\nOver all I still love our sunday mornings spent here.",106,3
"Who doesn't love Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf?! I have been a fan since we moved here 7 years ago. I really like my usual black forest iced coffee. The only reason I am giving this store a 3star is because when I come here at 5pm on a Sunday night the drive thru service is so ssllooww!! Other than that it's all good., and yes, I will be back!",90,2
"The BF and I came with our friends who live on this side of town. I've heard good things about the food and they said there were certain things they order that is quite nice there so we decided to give it a go. \n\nWe decided to do the dinner for two. Its' $39.99 and you get a choice of a soup or sald each, a shared appetizer, a entree each, and a dessert each. It seemed to be the way to go for dinner, since the prices are more during dinner than lunch...but it seems the portions look to be the same in pics? I don't get why places do that. \n\nLentil Soup - pretty good actually. Lighter type broth and had some spinach and the squeeze of lemon made it quite good. \nGreek Salad - pretty plentiful and the components were fresh. A bit overdressed, but still good. \nOur friends got other kinds of soup, chicken and a beef and rice one. \n\nFor appetizer we got- \nBaba ganoush - pretty solid, a bit smoky and nice texture. I like that there was a bit of pink pickles, I wish we ordered a plate of pickles. \nHummus - our friends got this and it was decent flavor and consistency, but the baba ganoush was the winner. \n\nThey handmake their own puffy pita which is a plus, and ask for refills. They give some olive oil with zaatar. \n\nBeef kebob - it was just OK. It could use more flavoring and was rather small pieces to be charging what they do. On pictures, it seemed that kebobs were much plumper back then. \nMoussaka - it was a vegetarian one, and wasn't like a traditional stacked style but more a stuffed eggplant with chickpeas and tomato sauce. It's their own take that reminds me of Lebanese stuffed eggplant. It was good for vegan version, but disappointing that I was expecting it to be something else. The thing that was crappy is our friend LOVES their moussaka here and always ordered it - when it had meat in it. He was so disappointed he sent it back because it was not really something he was aware changed. I don't get why they would get rid of a classic. I know they got requests for more vegetarian options, but that sucks for everyone else. Could be in addition to, not instead of. Stuffing a eggplant with meat mix vs the chickpeas isn't too difficult. Please, don't let vegans ruin a good thing. \n\nWe got the baklava to go. It was a plentiful serving of 4 little rolls each which was nice. It was pretty decent and oddly we got two different batches of one crispy and one not as crispy and we all had different opinions which we preferred. \n\nService was odd. She was nice in a kinda awkward way of trying to make chit chat, but was definitely struggling to serve 3 tables with basics. We ordered fries and hoped for bread ASAP since there was a slightly cranky baby with us too. Our bread was sitting on the pas for a while so it was more crunchy than fluffy when we got the first batch. Boo. It was also a wait for the bill even though it was clear mom and baby were gone, my BF was getting fresh air and we needed.\n\nFor having spent $100 for dinner for 4, we expected far better. It seems my friends who are regulars even seem to be a bit upset and don't want to be back when that particular lady is working (they seem to only get bad service with her) and hope that the moussaka will be back. I live far enough that I'm not sure if I will make the effort to come back, specially since DW is next door. Maybe to-go of some baba ganoush.",810,2
"I finally caught up with these guys at the phoenix market. I really love the soft flat bread they use as buns, its wonderful. And the owner, couldn't be nicer. My experience was really a positive one. The dog I had with the mango chutney on it was great, the one with blue cheese, cole slaw, and barbecue sauce was surprisingly good as well. I hope to catch them at shadys in the future!",89,3
"MEH. This place is hit or miss. The food is good, I like the barbacoa, but the service can be awful. The  uppity older male host was rude to me and my boyfriend for not knowing where to find the bathroom by approaching us as we looked lost and saying \""LIKE I SAID, the bathrooms are around the corner!!\"" Its like, dude, I didn't notice that you were talking to me before, why are you being so rude?\n\nThe parking can be a nightmare. Their motto pretty much is \""we can be rude, cuz you probably will be back to eat our food\""\n\nI won't be back.",139,1
"So during your stay, $200 are taken out from your credit card incase you break something in the hotel... when i checkedout they said the money would be returned my account in a few days. well its been 13 buisness days and still no money. found out it was given to the wrong account!",69,0
The food is the same as any other Cafe Rio however the service is awful. In the middle of my order the food line person left. 10 minutes later another new employee came over and had no idea what order was who's. In the meantime  the food sat there getting cold. If you haven't been there yet go soon as I believe this location won't last long.,82,1

"I stayed here two years ago for my birthday. We stayed 2 nights here at the HRH All Tower King Suite, and then 2 nights at the Planet Hollywood Westgate Towers 1 bedroom suite.  The rooms are just ok to me. Visually, it looks exactly how it appears on their website, but things were just off.  The lamp they have that hangs on the wall above their couch was bent. Almost looked like someone tried to swing on it the night before lol. Hey what happens in vegas stays in vegas right? But could you fix it before we check in? Oh, let me explain one thing, there were 4 in my group, 2 of us each stayed in the HRH King Suites, and we had adjoining rooms, so in one room, the internal ipod dock and speakers they had within the room worked perfectly, in the other one it didnt work at all. That was a let down, because that's one of the coolest features of this room. Since we were only staying for 2 nights and were able to share the sound system we didn't ask to switch rooms or complain about it at all.  Last downside would be in my cousins room their toilet was pre clogged. Plus sides? They came up right away when we called them with this issue and fixed it immediately. Bed was comfortable and couch was comfortable. It's off the strip so if you don't mind walking or taking taxis its not too bad. We always rent a car so we are never too worried if we want to stay somewhere off the strip.",322,2
Overcrowded small place and long wait. Food was reasonably good. Location is weird and obscure.\nWe ordered moules frites which was good. I ordered a grapefruit margarita which I didn't like.,43,2

"I happened on this place because it was next to EL Brava, a Mexican place recommended by the USAirways in flight magazine as a place to try in an airport. Getting to ElBrava we found it was a fast food stand with very little seating so this is next door. \n\nThe menu was pretty limited. Service actually wasn't bad but, even though it wasn't busy, we waited a long, long time for our meal to get there.... something you don't expect in an airport. When the food got there it ok. I had a burger that was pricey and non memorable. \n\nNext time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!",149,1
"Now, I'm not one to really tear into a place with a scathing review (ANYMORE) so I will choose my words carefully for this place.\n\n*Stares at blank review spot... 3 minutes pass*\n\nWell...\n\n*4 minutes pass*\n\nErrr...\n\n*7 minutes*\n\nSo, I got nothing.\n\nI will start at the parking garage. We parked at the red 2 section and ended up having to go to orange 4 so we could reach the elevator to the building. Upon leaving we had to go to orange 4 to cut through green3 wind up back at red 2. BTW what is with the hundreds of foot prints across the ceiling of the parking garage? The place looked kind of dingy already and this just made me break out the sanitizing wipes.\n\nThe Adventuredome is what I believe to be the main attraction. A huge glass structure with rides and attractions and oh so much fun for the family. If this place was actually clean it would really be great for kids. Lots of fair foods like cotton candy and plenty of cute rides they would all love. I think the older kids and even the parents could have fun too. \n\n\nEverything is just SO dirty!\n\nYou just don't want to touch anything. Blah...",291,1
"The sandwiches are interesting and the fries in them are interesting.\n\nI don't like fries or potatoey fries, mostly just the crispy ones.\n\nThe sandwich was good and quick but because I'm not a huge fan of fries it wouldn't make sense for me to go back.\n\nIt also was super crowded.",74,2

"This location is a Sprint \""Corporate\"" store. If you are a former Sprint employee who still enjoys the benefits of a SERO plan, but you want to get a new phone then more than likely you will get directed here. And you will learn quickly that this \""Corporate\"" store sucks. \n\nIt starts from when you walk in...and most of the time there's a wait to get to the kiosk. There's a wait to get to speak to someone. There's a wait to buy a phone. There's a wait to get help with accessories. There's a wait for pretty much anything and everything. If you are a fan of lines/ queues, than this is queue heaven for you. For the rest of us we think this location sucks donkey balls because it's painfully slow. I have visions of lines for soup in Russian gulags in the middle of cold Siberia moving faster than this place does. Once in a while you will get a staff member who knows what their doing and if you haven't fallen asleep waiting you'll be pleased when they finally take care of you. But that being said double check everything, especially if they make a plan change. This store has a nasty habit of totally messing up plans to the point that it can take an hour or more on the phone with a customer care specialist to try and make things right. It's happened more than once to me so consider yourself warned. (Thankfully the awesome staff at the Bristol Call Center can right many a wrong!)\n\nAs for how to rate this place...when you get a good employee helping you it's 4 Star territory. But the wait is so atrocious it drops a star. Add in the fubar'ed plan changes and you lost another star. \n\n2 Stars is the best I can give. And as I'm still grumbling 24 hours after my visit that 2nd Star is iffy....",405,1

"This place is great! The food tastes like it is homemade and I get to watch soccer at the same time so that's a plus. I have gotten the beef Shepard's pie, Chicken Bap, Beef Stew, and the Fish sandwich. I also have to say that the French fries are to die for! I would say that this place is one of the best in the south side for food and drinks.",85,3
"We came here on a Monday night and ordered off of their late night specials. We ordered \n1. All-nighter breakfast, 1.99\n2. classic burger and fries, 2.99\nfor 6.38\n\n- This is a great place for your midnight munchies. Compared to the Grand Cafe's in other Station Casinos. This spot is clean and rarely filled with drunks. \n- The Grand Cafe is a better alternative than Denny's. It's cheaper. As long as you have a boarding pass, you are in the clear. \n- The only reason why it's not a 5 star is because I prefer going to Coronado Cafe at South Point. Although this place has steak and eggs for 5.95, they got the same thing but for 3.95! haha. \n- Service is simple. We got our food quickly. Jonathan was a pleasant dude. \n- All-night breakfast was simple. Quick late night craving satisfied. \n- Classic burger and fries were also simple. No frills. If you are craving a hamburger, I'd say it's a better alternative than the Jack in the Box that is off of Gibson. \n- Overall, amazing place to dine when the cravings hit and you have time to sit and relax.",288,3
"We took the family out for dinner on a Thursday night.  The kids wanted chips & salsa, gotta love'm!\n\nIt is a bit hidden of the beaten path but Yelp & iPhone map took us right to the front door. \n\nThe patio is really interesting. It was a bit chilly for our taste, but others were bundled up and enjoying the patio. We sat inside near the fireplace. \n\nThe chips & salsa were good, not the best, but not the worst by far.  Three of us shared fajitas and our son had a cheeseburger & fries, very authentic \""Mexican\"", only my son!! The burger didn't last long, it must have been awesome because he had already had a basket of chips on his own. We enjoyed our fajitas, our daughter has been on a fajita kick for about three months now. Guess its less expensive than the Prime Rib kick she was on the eight months prior. \n\nWe had a nice evening, but Aunt Chilada's is a bit far for us to drive for Mexican food.",227,2
"went there tonight with my wife and 2 year old. We had 6 tacos some rice and 3 waters. $21.00 was what the bill came to. I could not believe that the Tacos were so lights, hardly any meat or cheese for a $2.50 taco. The kids working were friendly, but friendly unfortunately is what I'm paying for. I'm paying a price for a fair value and friendliness is expected. I can't see myself going there again or recommending. Instead I will share my experience and opinion with anyone I can. It's too bad since we are so sick of B King and McDonalds. We were hoping that this place would be good. Thumbs up for starting a business or branching off of Tailgaters. Thumbs down for providing minimal value. Owners are the same from Tailgaters. The food at both places is brutal. The flyers Gordos put out at Desert Fitness are hand written. These people obviously do not share the same passion as other eating places that succeed. Go eat at Trilogy. Kids eat free and you will pay less for way better food.",233,0
"Went In on a Thursday night around 7. The restaurant was completely empty, I went in with with my boyfriend and son. Service was okay, the girl took to long in between to check up on us probably cause she was busy talking behind the counter. Food was ordered at the same time and my boyfriend got his first and I had to wait another 10 min, which my bf was almost done with his food by the time I got mine. Food was good but not for the price, definitely over charging. Wouldn't recommend or go back",113,1
"This one is easy. 2.5 but rounding up because it is beautiful. The experience, not so much\n\nThe place is effing gorgeous. Everything is grand and opulent, it is everything you should expect from Steve Wynn's newest hottest nightclub. Huge pool to walk around, surrounded by tables and cabanas and a pretty good vantage point of the dj booth from anywhere. Has almost the feel of an amusement park, very groomed.\n\nWe didn't even walk through the inside section, but by the time it filled up, we wouldn't have been able to, and I was glad, it was way too packed. I like that people can spread out and the is still space to move, and that it has such large outdoor space, it feels good to breath non-sweaty air. \n\nEven though we got right in with pre-sale tix ($20/female), there is something about being here that is annoying. Almost feels like you are on a serving platter. Observers (typically male) will poke and prod at you with their violating eyes, approach you tactlessly, ignore the other people in your party, and just generally slather their douchebaggery all over you. The bartenders are snotty and take forever (granted they have to deal with a lot) and the drinks are weak and ridiculously priced (really). \n\nI concluded after this night, I am officially over it. Clubs have lost all appeal for me.\n\nAtmosphere: 5/5\n\nClientele: 2/5\n\nBartenders: 2/5\n\nDrinks: 2/5",351,2

"Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie is a European-style pastry shop, located inside the Bellagio, just steps away from the Bellagio Conservatory (see blog post here). The mastermind behind Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie is Chef Jean Philippe Maury, an award winning French pastry chef who grew up in the South of France. Did I mention that he is the Executive Pastry Chef at the AAA Five Diamond Bellagio? I thought I should slip the \""AAA Five Diamond\"" part in front of \""Bellagio\"" to emphasize my point. ;) Am I the only one who thinks this is impressive?\n\nJean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie has two locations on the Las Vegas Strip, one inside the Bellagio and one inside Aria Hotel. I have been to both locations, but only purchased desserts from the one located in Bellagio. All the pastries are made daily at his kitchen inside Aria, and delivered to the Bellagio.\n\nWalking into Jean-Philippe P\u00e2tisserie is breath taking, the interior decor is nothing short of gorgeous. What first catches your eyes is the life-size mannequin on a pedestal, wearing a dress fashioned out of chocolate, then your eyes wanders scans the interior of the pastry shop, where you'll see shelves full of chocolates and confections, even a wedding cake or two, then you look towards the entrance, where you will see a multi-tier chocolate fountain, supposedly the largest chocolate fountain in the world. Lastly, you enter the pastry shop, look towards the display cases located in the centre of the pastry shop... where you will find pastries and a large variety of desserts, beautifully crafted, and you know it is time to let your inner glutton out.\n\nI tried three dessert items: Raspberry Tart, Nutella Napoleon and Opera. The Nutella Napoleon consists of caramelized chocolate puff pastry, topped with chocolate creme brulee and chocolate mousse. The Opera is made of almond coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache. Lastly, the Raspberry Tart...  starts out with almond shortbread tart at the bottom, topped with pistachio cream, raspberry cream and stunning fresh raspberries. All three of these desserts were incredibly delicious and rich. The taste absolutely lives up to their appearance, if not exceeding it.\n\nHonestly, I need stop writing and let the photos do the talking, come to my blog to check them out! ;)\n\nhttp://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/09/jean-philippe-patisserie-bellagio-las.html",533,4
"You know what?  I love Dillard's.  I love this chain.  I used to work for them when I first moved to Arizona, actually, and while I quit it almost immediately (let's face it, some people just hate retail work), I've always liked their selection.  Their pricing can be fair, and it's just a step between Sears/JC Penney and Neiman Marcus.  It's a good middle place.\n\nBut the Dillard's in Scottsdale Fashion Square is the PITS.  I went here the other day on my lunch break.  I was actually thinking of shelling out some serious cash just to get a pair of jeans that would last awhile and look good.  \n\nI walked by not one, not two, not even three, but SIX employees who did NOT offer to help me in any way.  One even looked at me with her eyebrow raised like she thought I was going to steal something!  Was it because I was in no makeup and glasses?  Would I have had better customer service if I'd come in wearing my contacts, makeup, and a skirt?  Seriously, people...I assume it's the same as when I worked there several years back--that pay is dependent on both the hourly wage and also the sales rung up.  Are you honestly going to tell me that SIX employees had no interest in a woman carrying around a pair of $100 jeans?\n\nI just shrugged and got a pair of Levi's instead.",323,0
"Good bar to hang out in if you don't mind so-so food. Burgers are good, the rest of the menu is OK. Typical bar food. Beer prices are fair and service is pretty good.

Bottom line,  I ordered sashimi - yellowtail, halibut, tuna, and snow crab.  2 pieces each\nAnd completely overpriced as most strip sushi places.  However, not as good as others.  Miso soup and a martini too and those were pretty decent.  They were an hour from closing and were doing everything to get ready, as most of us would do.  I get it, you want to go home.

"Sakura now serves ramen!  They offer miso, tonkatsu and shoyu.  Each bowl is $5.95.  There are also several options to add to your meal including more chashu, boiled egg, chicken teriyaki, tempura etc.  I believe the add-ons ranged from $0.50 to $2.00.\n\nThe ramen isn't the best I've ever had, but so far it's the best item I've had on their menu.  I ordered the shoyu ramen and added a boiled egg.  It comes with the usual fixings, green onion, ginger, bamboo and a slice of chashu.  The pork is tender, the broth isn't too salty and the noodles were decent.  Again, not the best ever but you're getting a good portion for $6.\n\nThe service has also improved from last time.  The cook was churning out teriyaki combos one after another and orders were called by the receipt number.  Faster and more accurate service!  For those days where I just need a bowl of soup for lunch (winter is coming after all!) I can see myself coming back for their ramen.",255,2
"Came in finally to see what all the hype was about - though I'm not a big anime fan. Anyhoo!\nThe takoyaki was definitely good. We ordered seafood ramen, tonkotsu and the tonkotsu/shoyu. Food was also good, although they left out one side we ordered and we weren't crazy about the tonkotsu. Service wasn't the fastest, but decent after we got our drinks. Biggest complaint is how cold the place was; it's about 35 F outside and not much warmer inside. Warmed up after the ramen and multitudes of people who came in though, and servers were super helpful.

"I can understand why many reviews have been posted here from people who have seen other Cirque shows and felt let down with Love.  I think it is a different show than the others, which doesn't have as much of the acrobatics going on (although it does have a good amount), and spends about a third of its time with dancing.  In a certain way, that is to be expected, as it is a show reflecting interpretations of the Beatles music, and their music just makes you want to ...  dance!  \n\nBut, I certainly understand that this is not what we expect from the brand name of Cirque du Soleil, and there were times I wished it was more like O, which totally floored me when I saw it.  Besides for these two, I have not seen any other Cirque shows, so I don't have much else to compare.  \n\nI think what we have to remember, though, is that The Beatles music, while eclectic in many ways, is quite common to our ears as compared to the strange and worldly music that fills the atmosphere of the other Cirque shows.  The majority of us going to go see this show are very familiar with what we are hearing.  They have spiced it up a bit with new mixes of the music, and with cool little interludes of interviews and dialogue from the Fab Four.  \n\nAll in all, I can't say that I am unhappy with Love, but I think it helps to know in going that it is a horse of a slightly different color than the other big Cirque shows on the strip.",332,3

We walked in to discover a very bustling place with a reasonably friendly vibe.  We were able to snag a small table to the side where we were able to enjoy our pints and do a bit of people watching.  \n\nI get the impression that this could be a good place to come, especially to enjoy the beer garden on a sunny day, but I think it was a bit more than we were looking for on Friday.  I'm going to sound like a total old person but it was just a bit too loud for what we wanted at the time, and I really do think that I built it up a bit too much in my head to properly enjoy it for what it was.  \n\nI would happily come back here for some sun, but I think it's just not quite my style for an after work pint.",224,2
"My husband and I stopped at Las Velas early on Sunday afternoon. We ran the Great Race that morning and had to celebrate by feeding our ravenous stomachs! I have been looking for a good, traditional Mexican restaurant ever since my old favorite--Nopalitos in Latrobe--changed to bar-only food. This place hit the spot.\n\nThe place was pretty bare, with only a few other couples eating. We sat towards the front of the restaurant by the windows overlooking Market Square. Such a pretty view. \n\nWe immediately ordered the chips and queso and attached them as soon as the waitress set them on the table.  OMG were they heavenly. I am not above licking any bowl clean and the bowl of queso was no exception.\n\nI ordered the Puerco en mole poblano and I received two heaping plates of pork smothered in a heavenly mol\u00e9 rojo sauce, pico de gallo, beans, lettuce and guacamole.  After gorging myself on chips and cheese, I was worried I wouldn't be able to enjoy a lot of my meal but I downed three tortillas with ease. I was still left with a TON of food so I took it home. There was no way I was leaving it. \n\nMy husband ordered the Alambres Carne which had the most amazing pork and cheese. Even though I was about to explode, I couldn't stop picking it off his plate.\n\nThe food was incredible and very authentic. The service was pretty good expect it took a long time to get our food. I like to think it was because they were actually making everything rather than heating some frozen mixture up.  But the wait aside, it was a fantastic meal and I highly recommend it. Definitely get the chips and queso!!",369,3

I asked \""Terri\"" at front desk, what can they do for me, and while I secretly hoped I'd get $20 gambling credit while I waited, I was shocked that she blasted *me* for the Flamingo Las Vegas's ineptness. Unbelievable. If you saw it you'd be shocked too (as were patrons waiting in line as I passed them).\n\nShe wasn't the only unfriendly, unprofessional front desk person. And in case you think this is a whine, read my stock. I praise and reward good service, am neutral for average, and believe me, three at their front desk (mostly \""Terri\"") should be banned from all forms of customer service employment. Though that's a fictional request, they truly are that bad.\n\nI also asked a random customer at the pay-slot internet kiosk near tower elevators if that worked. She said she burned $20, still was trying to get it to print a flight boarding pass, and that the front desk said they weren't responsible.\n\nP. S. the front desk queue design is horrid anyway. Lots of dead time with no one in front of queue going up until an agent comes over and yells NEXT! (And they have to, it's so noisy)\n\nBut a cool pool, nice room (cool curtain control!), card key success rate 100% on one card and 0% on other (one more wait in front desk line!!), room safe small but practical. Monorail access very easy.\n\nTheir version of the fascist \""Las Vegas resort fee\"" was $20 in September 2013. And city planners still hate cab drivers and riders, because the cab lines on the strip were stupidly atrocious, and at the airport on a weekday morning, insane. Come on, Vegas. You have people waiting in line to buy a product, and lines of suppliers wanting to provide it. What's the problem?!",555,2
"Most modern airports have a pretty decent selection of restaurants.  Most modern airports look absolutely identical as well, as their selection consists entirely of the exact same chains.  At least here you can get a halfway decent bagel (either with cream cheese or as a breakfast sandwich), along with a drink, and it's not too bad, as this chain isn't found everywhere you look.",79,1
"The hotel is extremely nice, however the reason for my low rating is the noise from the pirate show at night. This woke me up and the hotel staff were unwilling to assist with changing my room and did not mention this at all. We were told we got a jacuzzi room and just had a jacuzzi tub that barely fit one person.",68,0
"Fellow yelpers, I was mislead by the reviews of this place! I frequently browze yelp to find new places to eat and must respectfully disagree with most of the reviews.\n\nFirst off, it was so hot in this place; I don't think they had the air on. It also smelled like maybe their grease trap needed emptied-- not pleasant.\n\nFor a quick service setting, it was not quick at all. We waited 10 minutes to order on the counter, and then waited another 20 for it to be brought to our table. I had the tomato soup, which actually tasted pretty good but was still cold. I also had the California Turkey sandwich was a little too bready  for my taste, but otherwise okay.\n\nThe boyfriend had the marketplace turkey, which is served open-faced. He seemed to like his well enough.\n\nThis may have just been a bad visit, but I have no desire to come here again.",205,1
"I guess it was all the hype surrounding this place is One of the reasons for DISAPPOINTMENT. The casing on the hotdog was inedible so couldn't finish it, the chili was awful and made the bun soggy, the cheese usually buffers this. I like biting into a plump juicy hotdog, this was not. The onion rings were good.  \nThe line was long but moved right along and there wasn't a lot of seating the people seemed to leave in good increments so the tables opened up. \n\nSo if you like hotdogs DON'T go here. If all you want are some onion rings and a soda then by all means go..",141,1
Really enjoyed. Can't wait to come back and try more. Had the Veal chop. Tasty but a little under cooked. Great 3 way caprese salad we shared.  Lisa had the salmon. Nice.  Great service and atmosphere.,52,3
"Go and enjoy. Food was superb, service was excellent, Prices are reasonable and despite reviews to the contrary, portions are perfect. If you're looking for food that is piled ten feet high on a plate without regard to taste, the Cheesecake Factory is right up on Camelback.",58,4
"Fabulous with two dance floors and different levels. I liked how each dance floor/level had different music playing. The main dance floor was packed, the bottom floor was more chill and then the other dance floor down the hall from the main one was where I spent most of my time. The venue was very cool with the Asian fusion and Buddha decorations. We waited in line for maybe 10 minutes. And when we left the club, all the girls got complimentary TAO sandals for our tired feet... they already know we would be dancing the night away and going crazy. Definitely a good PR gift. I can't wait to come back to Vegas and party here again! I want to try the restaurant next time too.",147,3
"The \""sister\"" property to the Venetian, the Palazzo has many of the same amenities that you come to expect. \n\nAll rooms are suites. . . large sprawling rooms with 3 flat screen TV's, a separate sunken living room with a sofa sectional (doubles as a sleeper), desk and table, and a bed with tons of pillows and comfy linens. \n\nMy favorite feature? Don't laugh but they have motorized curtains that allow you to lay in bed and via remote control open the draperies and raise and lower the Roman shade. (yeah . . .sometimes it's the little things!) \n\nRoom service is expensive (what isn't in Vegas?) and when they have a large group in the hotel- wait times can be over an hour and a half so plan accordingly. On three of the mornings I was here- the wait time was over an hour and the woman on the phone actually tried to talk me out of ordering . . . .and that wait was for cold cereal and a pot of coffee . . nothing even needed to be cooked! \n\nI know the goal of every hotel is to get you out of the room and into the casino but my wish was to have some basic amenities included. A coffee pot would have been nice so that I didn't have to pay $26 for a pot each morning or get my bed weary body up and down in the casino to wait in line for a cup of \""joe\"". Also-they charge $12.95 for Internet which also makes me nuts. \n\nFinally- I don't know if it was just \""off season\"" or what- but service at the pool area is pretty non existent. Only one of the 4 days I was there was I able to find a server.   And just when I was settling in- the server came by to tell me it was \""last call\"". At 4pm? I get that they wanted to close the pool- but there were plenty of people out there worthy of keeping the pool open at least until the sun went down. \n\nThe room rates are on par with other nice hotel in Vegas- (we had a group rate of around $188 but the normal price is usually around $250). Check your reservation before going so that you know which Tower your room is in (Venetian or Palazzo) for if you check in at the wrong Tower- you will have quite the hike to get to your room. \n\nHotels, for me, are all about the level of service you receive. The Palazzo, does okay as it is certainly functional- but the beauty of the hotel sets you up for a bit of a let down. After all- how could some place that look so nice, stumble in so many basic service areas?",588,2
"Wow, I don't understand why this place has so many 4 and 5 star reviews.  Unfortunately we were there on a Saturday, no all you can drink beer/sake (bud light/house sake).  We actually went around lunch and dinner time (got there at 3:45 dinner starts at 4).  They gave us the option to do AYCE lunch $23.95 or dinner $26.95.  I wanted to do dinner so I could order Uni but we opted for lunch and I'm so glad we did.  Since it was our first time there I wanted to scope it out and see how fresh their fish were.\n\nNot so fresh!  I thought the nigiri was below average... the rice was undercooked and the fish smelled fishy and was cut horribly.  For example, the salmon nigiri we ordered was huge but not in a good way.  The texture of it was like biting into flesh or something, yuck.  It was definitely not melt in your mouth sushi.  \n\nThe rolls were alright (then again the fish is smothered with sauce but we could still taste a little fishiness).  They made a roll for us they didn't have on the menu which was nice of them.  Poke was alright, although they gave only a few chunks of Ahi and lots of onion (I'm assuming it is Ahi).\n\nThe only rolls I enjoyed were the avocado roll and natto roll.  My husband wants to go back for their all you can drink night, I'm not sure if I will be joining him.  If I do I will be ordering ala carte (avocado and natto roll).",359,1
"Wow. I was torn, but now I'm not. Stephanie, you are a great person but your work \""this time\"" did not show that. I'm wondering how the pictures I took seem \""suspicious\""? That's a pretty ballsy thing to say especially since you tried to fix that exact problem 3 separate times and YOU even pointed out that it didn't look right and that you would cut down the price BECAUSE of that. As far as \""no hair stylist ever getting my hair right\"", I'm not sure who you heard that from, but it wasn't me. The charging too much was true, however, you charged me $100 for a job that WASN'T DONE. I would rather pay too much and have my hair perfect, than pay to leave with my roots still showing. And I'm wondering why you say that you, \""always use bleach\"" when after the first round of treatment I asked you \""Did you use bleach?\"" and you told me EXPLICITLY, \""I DON'T USE BLEACH.\"" !?!??!?\n\nI showed three different people the picture of my hair after I left your salon and ALL of them told me that I should not have paid. And they're right, I really shouldn't have. But I did because I know you tried and I liked you as a person.\n\nAs far as a personal attack on me for being a \""beauty school drop-out\"", I don't know how you think insulting me was warranted by my review, but let me just say that INSULTING past clientele is bad for business. I wrote the truth, nothing but that. I did not slander you, I did not call you a terrible person. All I said is what I know to the be the truth. \n\n1. It took entirely too long.\n2. You charged me $100 for a job that wasn't done.\n3. My hair looked TERRIBLE. \n\nTruth. Nothing else.",428,0
"I was surprised by the poor reviews for this place, until I looked closer and realized none of the reviewers had tried the food. Big mistake! This place is really, really good. \n\nWe started with the Syrian salad, which had fresh lettuce, pine nuts, nicely boiled eggs (kinda molten in the center), and perfectly cooked green beans (which, I've learned the hard way, is surprisingly difficult to do!). It was tossed in a slightly spicy sauce, and came with a generous basket of fresh whole wheat bread.  My friend and I also split the smoked trout sandwich, which had what I believe was goat cheese, slightly spicy seasoning, thinly sliced cucumbers and fresh lettuce, and was served with caper berries (when was the last time you tried a caper berry?!). For dessert, we tried the triple chocolate molten cakes. They were still warm in the center (and it was noon, so this bodes well for the standard lunch crowd), not too sweet, really decadent.\n\nDespite the food being awesome, what really made this lunch special was the service---I'd give it 6 stars, if I could (and I'm not a hyperbolic person, they just went above and beyond the standard call of duty): the counter server thoughtfully helped us reason our way through the menu choices, then brought us out little glasses of water with lemon, explaining that she'd be there to refill them whenever we needed (and she was! They were ridiculously small glasses, I felt badly for her!). I asked if I could get a to-go box for the rest of my sandwich, and a different server took care of this for me. I didn't learn until later this afternoon that she had wrapped the minimal remains of my sandwich carefully in wax paper (it looked like one of those expertly-wrapped xmas presents!) before placing it in a larger bag. All of their food clearly contained this type of thoughtfulness and careful preparation.\n\nI'll be back again soon, and hope to try their amazing looking coffee cake next time!",424,4
"Ugh, where to start... I've been going here since before it changed from the waterfront to Nate's. I only go if I'm already in the complex at Luna or Pita Jungle.  When it first opened it was actually a great bar. Now... I'll just break it down like this:\n\nCons\n- Off track betting = Shady guys drinking cokes eye balling the very few women in the bar.\n- There is always a broken toilet AND sink in the women's restroom\n- I hear there are often broken pissers/ sinks in the men's room as well\n- There is only one good bar tender \n- The crowd has definitely started getting super shady- sliding back to the waterfront crowd... \n- They have a lobster tank - with sick/ dead lobsters in it\n- Gross tap lines - been sick here a few times - stick to bottled beer\n- The decor is old/ ripped posters - needs help - the patio is empty - why not make it inviting - it's not like you have this awesome lake view or anything...\n\nPros\n- Boston is the best bartender in town!\n- They finally put 1 TV on the patio. It's too small to see though unless you sit right in front if it.\n- The lake outback is beautiful - however you can also see it from many other places\n- Lots of TVs inside - just don't mind being watched like a TV yourself if you're a girl...\n- Ok selection of beers \n- Great place to go watch football but just know half the TVs will be on horse races",347,0
"I've sent documents out of this office twice via Priority Mail. Both times it has taken a week or more for the item to be delivered. Priority Mail is supposed to take 2-3 Days.\n\nIf you have something that has to be delivered quickly... I wouldn't recommend using USPS. Use Fed-EX, UPS, hell... use a Carrier Pigeon! If you can figure out any other way, it will probably get there faster than if you use USPS.\n\nOn this recent episode, I spoke to someone at this office and the excuse I was given is that my item was stuck in Chicago because of a Winter Vortex.... I'm no meteorologist, but I do have access to the internet. When I checked Weather dot com it didn't look like there was an extreme snow storm in the past week.\n\nI spoke to someone at the Arcadia Post Office as well and they could give me no answer as to where my item was currently located. \n\nDuring all of this, I was fiddling around on the USPS website to see who else I could email, and found this new commercial....\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01rJBQ2IjbQ\n\nAfter watching that, my Spidey Sense was tingling, or maybe it was just a surge of adrenaline fury after hearing the lady say \""Don't worry, the United States Postal Service will get it there ON TIME with PRIORITY MAIL flat rate shipping\"".... LIES! \n\nNot only has USPS screwed me over twice by delivering items late, but now they've sullied the good name of SpiderMan by including him in their filthy web of late package delivery-ness. Notice how the YouTube video doesn't allow comments either... Good choice USPS.\n\nThe only way I will ever use USPS for anything urgent again is if SpiderMan takes the package from my hand and delivers it himself. \n\nBelieve it or not, this was finally resolved. I ended up having to file a missing package case with the USPS customer service hotline. They gave me a case number and to their credit, that seemed to prod someone. Two days later my package was finally scanned and started its course again. What should have taken 2-3 days, took 10 days. On the bright side, at least it wasn't truly lost forever, but WTF... talk about frustrating. \n\nThis was going to be my second 1-star review, but after receiving 2 follow up calls from Kim who works at this location, I bumped it up to two. I appreciate her being efficient and thorough... even if the USPS system is not.",566,1
"This place is Amazing!  One of the Best Kabob House's I've ever been to!  We eat here EVERYTIME we come to Vegas!  If I could give them more than 5 stars I would.  They are amazingly friendly and accomodating, never mind having some of the best Food known to man... I wish they would open up a store identical to this one in SoCal.  The amount of business they would get would be out of control!  They have delivered to us on the strip and in Summerlin!  Our entire family has ordered from here and has enjoyed their very good service.   Try them out and you'll be impressed!",140,4
"I really, really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, when I got there at about 4pm, the empanadas had been picked over and there were few left to choose from. We only liked the sweet empanadas, none of the savory ones. The gentleman behind the counter was nice, but flustered and clueless on how to run my debit card thru the reader on the iPad to pay. Due to not so great food and uninviting, tiny space, I'll probably not be going back.",106,2
My brother got us a group rate for 12 of us that worked out to $35 a ticket which is better than you can get at the discount ticket places on the strip. At that price the show was alright but I wouldn't pay full price for it.\n\nThe seating of the show is absolutely awful. The chairs were the most uncomfortable I sat in in a long time. They moved us to some booth style seats in the back instead which were much more comfy but they were about 4-6 inches lower than the chairs that were in front of us so the view wasn't very good.\n\nThe dancers were good and very beautiful however the lighting was also not very well done. \n\nSome people in our group really liked the show but I would definitely recommend going to see Fantasy at the Luxor instead. Fantasy is a much higher production show.,183,1
"I love this place!  They have an incredible selection of cheeses and if you are unsure which one to get, just ask Jeff (the bartender) for a recommendation or a sample.  Some of the cheeses I have discovered in Europe and thought I could never find here, are in their case.\n\nVery good beer, wine and drinks and you can't beat their happy hour deals.  The wait staff provide good service and are friendly.  The perfect place to unwind after work, spoil a staff member or have a memorable meal.",112,4
"NV Energy today shut down power at two of my businesses, despite us having paid both of those bills.  These are the results...\n\nAt my restaurant I have lost substantial business today, as well as losing product because my walk-in cooler is below what the health department requires.  An estimated loss of $3,000 of cooled goods.  Additionally, I have lost about $500 in potential revenue today because of their mistake.  They stated \""We are not responsible for the US Postal Service\"".  \n\nThey should have at least called to inform me of this.\n\nAt my other business, a commercial building with 80 people who work there we lost the entire morning as well as having some of our tech gear fry when they abruptly turned the power back on without notice.  We lost a rack of switches ($1,000 hardware item) plus one of our servers isn't responding since the disconnect.\n\nUnfortunately this is typical of any monopoly, and there is no \""economic recourse\"".  They never once said sorry, they just blamed everyone else.\n\nNow I'm saddled with placing 3 stop payments on checks (We averted a 3rd business from being shut-down) and those costs and hassles as well.\n\nGreat way to start 2012.  I hope the State of Nevada takes actions against this company.  I'm certainly filing a complaint.",309,0
The sign says 24 hrs but only open til midnight; 2 am Fri-Sat. That being said they make a wonderful pizza and the $6.95 Xtra large Pepperoni is great. Good NY crust dough style. Perfect for picking up on the way home or out for a work lunch pickup. They do deliver. Only has a few tables for dine in. Great selection means everyone will find something to love. Also good for groups to call in office lunch orders. The only trick is the parking/ getting in there but that's no knock  'cause it's worth the effort.,126,2
"I really wanted to love this hotel. A hotel with a water park? Who can beat that. But from the onset it got off to a rocky start.\n\nAny place that calls itself \""Arizona Grand Resort\"" has set the bar high. But the curb appeal is something closer to a Motel 6. Unkempt grounds lead up to the main lobby building.\n\nI pulled up to the front and explained to the valet that I wished to run inside and check-in. My wife and daughter would remain in the car. The valet demanded my car keys. We went back and forth for about 5 minutes until he finally allowed me to just move it a few feet over.\n\nCheck-in went ok but I wasn't advised were my room was (the place is huge!) on the map. Instead I was told to ask one of the valets (great) to show us to our building.\n\nSo I go outside, show our room number to another one of the 'happy' valets and he jumps in a golf carts and takes off (I suppose I'm to follow). He flies through parking lots (some are very tight roads along side buildings) until we wind up at our building. It looks like a rear entrance. There are no handicap parking spots to be found anywhere (I'm disabled), lots of monster trucks taking up two spaces), and exposed wires in the ground. I dismiss the 'happy' valet.\n\nWe head to our room upstairs through an elevator as cold as a meat locker.\n\nWe check on the water park, come to find out it's only open on Saturday and Sunday (11-4), we checked in Friday at 4pm.\n\nSaturday morning we line up for the water park at the main gate along with several other families. There are plenty of park staff members on the other side of the gate. 11:00 turns and the gate doesn't open. Eventually one of the staff members says the gate is not the entrance, you have to enter through the gift shop. Seriously? No sign? They couldn't say that once for the previous 20 minutes?\n\nSaturday night we called the front desk to get a late checkout. The girl who answered said we would have to call back Sunday morning because only the Sunday manager would know their occupancy. Trust me when I tell you that hotel did not look very occupied. I asked her, how it could be that the hotel did not know it's occupancy? She admitted it was at 65% but that she wasn't allowed to give late checkouts. Fine.\n\nWe called back Sunday morning around 8am to get a late checkout and were told no.\n\nSo, basically, we purchased a water park access room for two days and could only use it for one day.\n\nThat's criminal. With so many other options in hotels, resorts, and water parks available there is no excuse for this.\n\nI recommend that people stay elsewhere. If you are coming from out of state just for the hotel's waterpark, then go to a legoland, the waterpark is better.",668,1
"3 1/2 stars - 4 stars.\n\nEnded up booking a Vegas trip on a busy weekend (some basketball tournament), so everything that weekend from flight to hotels were extra pricey than usual. After going back and forth from Cosmo, PH, Aria, and all the other nice ones hoping that if we refreshed the site it would go down but sadly that did not happen haha so settled for Bally's. We picked Bally's since it was right on the strip.\n\nFirst reaction to the outside seemed a bit outdated and a bit sad. Casino is quite spacious, but i'm not much of a gambler so can't say much in that department. A few cafes and restaurants inside. Located right on the strip next to Paris and PH hotel. My gf's and I walked to PH for Earl's Sandwiches and for their popular Miracle Mile Shops. \n\nInside our room was a pleasant surprised. Bathroom was spacious and great mirror for us ladies to do our makeup :) or some would say put our face on haha. Room was pretty spacious, closet with mirrors. It was myself and 3 gf's and closet was still pretty spacious.  2 full/queen beds. The bed was to my surprise real comfy! The pillows were like the pricey hotel pillows. Goose feather like that just sinks down. But not too low where you feel like the pillow is smothering you. The bed matteress itself was comfy and bouncy. And the blankets were soft and not like cheap hotel blankets. I think my favorite was the bed! especially after long nights or partying and drinking the bed is pretty important. Unless your pissed drunk then even the floor may seem like cloud 9 haha. Although I did miss the other nice hotels, but if your on a budget and would rather spend money on dining and shopping like us than check out Bally's! After all your barely in the room ;)",392,2
"This place had potential, but it really wasn't all that. By far, the worst part of the experience was how separated the different age groups are; my three children (4, 7, and 12) weren't allowed to bounce together except in the small basket ball area and that made for a quite boring two hour. Jumpstreet is, in my opinion, better in value and overall enjoyment for kids.",88,2

"So, I've always longed to go to Upstream, but it's definitely out of my price range. Much to my excitement, I won a gift card in a charity fundraiser at work that allowed me to pay them a visit and taste what I might be missing.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went on a Sunday evening at 5:30. We figured we'd miss the crowds that way, and sure enough, it was much emptier than I expected after reading all the reviews. We were promptly seated - the decor was very classy, but not in an overdone way.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and attentive. He made some very detailed recommendations of food and wine that were accurate, and his subtle jokes and jabs made us feel like we were chatting with a good friend.\n\nWe started off with the chef's choice of oysters - 6 of them. They were delicious but also very small, and I wasn't feeling like we got our money's worth at all. Maybe it was because they were East Coast? Regardless, I wouldn't buy them at that price again.\n\nI was jonesin' for some Asian flair, so I my chosen entree was the Togarashi Dusted Big-Eye Tuna, rare. The tuna was tasty and high quality, and the sauce it was in was pleasurably tangy. The waiter had told me to expect it to be spicy, but I didn't find it spicy at all - maybe the seasoning on the tuna had a subtle kick, but not much. What surprised me most was the rice cake. I was almost as excited about it as the tuna, which is definitely not something I expect for rice! It is a clump of sushi rice that is quickly dipped into a flash-fryer to crisp the outside into something so perfect that I'm considering buying a fryer just to try to replicate it. Combined with the sauce, it was divine. My one complaint about the dish was the pickled veggies that are stacked on top. I thought the sauce was super tangy all by itself - the pickled flavor was just all too much. I couldn't eat them. But I cleaned the rest of my plate happily!\n\nMy boyfriend got the Scottish Salmon, which he also really enjoyed, especially the curry sauce that went along with it. He cleaned his plate completely! He is gluten allergic, and the waiter was very patient to go through the whole menu with him in detail and let him know what could be made gluten-free. They do not have a separate gluten-free menu.\n\nOur bill came out rather high - 2 glasses of wine, 6 oysters, and 2 main courses came out at $90. We weren't concerned with the gift card in tow, but even with the great quality, it seemed kind of steep.\n\nAll in all, if you think a well-rounded meal for 2 at $90 is nothing to sneeze at, then by all means, visit Upstream! Otherwise, I'd save it for a special occasion.",638,3
"Popped into this small internet styled cafe for late lunch, you can find it wedged between two touristy clothes shops in the \""Arcade\"", walk through connecting North Bridge and Cockburn Street. Noticed it has upstairs Internet connected pc's, but in addition has wifi to boot. \n\nNeeded to work, so with quick password link was off. Then came coffee and a scone. However the unusual thing that materialised was the scone served in a soup bowl? While I'm not saying this was in anyway bad, it made buttering and jamming a wee bit awkward...maybe it was because I wasn't wearing my scone shoes the owners had perhaps noticed this!\n\nQuestioning whilst paying for lunch the young lad at the till, he seemed to either be unaware that it's difficult to grab an already soft scone on a flat plate; but near impossible a get it to your face in one piece from ceramic with a slight curvature.\n\nMaybe he was having a giraffe, or worse; had some mysterious force been at play the day before and smashed all the plates leaving them not time to replace any?\n\nWith not much of a response other than oh you didn't like it on that, I can't wait to go again to see what idiosyncrasies they might use in serving a pizza or pasta? Others were eating there but it was not busy, distinctly quiet apart from the tv on. \n\nHowever a nice toasted warm scone with cappuccino - and if your not in for working lunch then a massive plasma on the far wall at the weekend shows sport, not sure if they serve beers also though? \n\nIn all food and coffee ok, served quick and was warm! What do you think? Is this place a hit or a miss?",376,1
"The location of this Hard Rock restaurant is ok it is by a river and shopping area, not too bad on that front.Food and merchandise is the same as any other Hard Rock which is usually good.

Sure enough, we went inside and there was no one and the bartenders were shutting down for the night. Lame.",92,0
I used to love coming here for pedicures. I have got my nails done several times too.  If you don't mind waiting long and being told inaccurate times then this place is good for pedicures.

Staying at the Bellagio and had reservations at Le Cirque to end a great evening with front row seats at O by Cirque Du Soleil. Reservations were at 9:30 pm. Plenty of time to make it to reservations. Got there early and we were rudely told that even though we had reservations there will be a wait of 20-30 minutes and no window seating when they were half empty. Pathetic excuse of 5 star service. We decided not to wait because I couldn't imagine how the service the rest of the evening would be. Zero star for rude and attitude by male hostess or manager.,127,0
"I have been to some really nice Hampton Inns before, but this is not one of them.  The rooms are okay-- not super spacious but not cramped.  The counter staff that I spoke with were all very friendly and helpful, but the manager sounds like kind of a dick.   I shall explain:\n\nThere is a bar/club/restaurant next to the hotel.  During my stay, the bar sponsored a Jordan Sparks concert (I had to ask who she is, but apparently, she has something to do with some season of american idol) and a P Diddy concert.  When I got back from a looong work day, the walls of the hotel were vibrating with bass from the concert.  I went to down to the front desk:  Could they move my room to one less noisy?\n\nUnfortunately, they had 10 calls in 10 minutes for guests wanting to know the same thing.  The gals at the front desk were overwhelmed and called on the manager for help.  Now, I understand that the hotel has nothing to do with the noise level-- they are not responsible for the bar next door.  *However,* a good manager would have told the front desk folks to apologize profusely, offer to walk over to the bar to have a chat with the event person, and hand out earplugs by the bucketful.  This manager's response?  \""Let the guests call the cops.\""  Wow.\n\nSo, not the utmost concern for the guests' well-being.  Also, the hotel lobby and elevators smell strongly like a sewer.  Rooms did not, thank goodness.\n\nStill, there is free internet access and continental breakfast in the morning-- the happy reasons to stay in Hampton's.",366,2
"Every time I go to this Benihana, they lose 1 star and this time. I think I had enough and it went beyond the point even if I can get a free meal, I won't go back to this Benihana.\n\nThis time we went to celebrate my husband's birthday and we had the $30 certificate.\n\nThe quality of the sushi fish became worse. It's very watery, tasteless and not fresh but I won't complain much about it as there are many other sushi restaurants that serve the same quality of sushi in Phoenix. I think it's mainly because it's hard to get good fresh sushi grade fish in Phoenix although there are some Japanese restaurants that serve good fresh sushi.\n\nThe thing is their service. We waited about 15mins before the waitress took our order although we decided what we wanted to eat very quickly. She just didn't come back for that long.\n\nThen she made a mistake in our order. My husband said \""Sushi and Sashimi combo\"". She repeated the order as \""Sushi combo (without sashimi)\"". So my husband corrected \""No, not Sushi combo, I would like to have Sushi and Sashimi combo\"" and pointed out the item in the menu. She said \""okay\"". \n\nBut.....yes, she brought the small \""Sushi combo\"" instead of \""Sushi and Sashimi combo\"". I told her it's not what my husband ordered. And surprisingly, she said \"" I thought you ordered Sushi combo\""....and seemed she just wanted him to eat that. Hmmmm she \""thought\""..... So I told her my husband already corrected her mistake once by pointing out it in the menu. Then she said \""There must be some misunderstanding but I can change it.\"" I thought \"" Hmmmm....misunderstanding?\"" I think it's a obvious mistake, though.\n\nI didn't say anymore as my husband got what he ordered in the end and it was his birthday. In the end, she said \""Sorry for the misunderstanding\"" and I think that is the best we could get from her.\n\nAfter we finished our entrees, we again had to wait for about 30mins for the waitress to come by.\n\nThere's one thing we enjoyed which is the performance of the chef at our table. \nSo I give them 2 stars instead of 1.",512,1

"I agree with PS, way overrated.  And you'd think after all the years and the money this place makes it would refurbish the booth seats--they seem like the same since the 80's!  Salsa flavor was off, something missing like an herb, epazote?, and the chips, maybe its the GMO corn used to produce them, they just don't taste real.  The margarita was so acidic that by the second sip I couldn't drink anymore.  Service is also very complacent.  Cute little chile tepin bush in the planter next to the front door.",125,1

I was immediately greeted by a server and was offered a menu as well as a seat to place my order.\n\nI ordered a 1/2lb of lechon belly, 4 pieces of the bbq chicken skin and adobo kangkong for about $20.  While I was waiting, friendly staff offered me a glass of water.  Food was ready within 15 minutes.\n\nOverall, the food was very tasty but only thing was I wished the skin on the lechon and bbq chicken skin was crispier.  In all fairness it could've gotten soggy while driving home and doing a 10 minute errand but don't know for sure.  Other than that, flavor profile on everything was good and will definitely try again!",185,3

"The rooms are clean and the service is decent, but the walls are thin enough to follow the television programming in the room on one side of your own while simultaneously enjoying the ecstatic moans and mattress squeaking from your neighbors on the other side.

Eating outside with yummy food and listening to hip music made me feel like the \""cool\"" kid in high school.\n\n1.  Tamago burger (burger patty, egg over easy, onion strings, teriyaki sauce and furikake) - The yolky egg easily won me over, but the crunch of the onion strings and furikake cemented its win.  It wasn't the tastiest patty ever but definitely texturegasmic.\n2.  Fuku Moco - this was basically a mini loco moco bowl with an added bonus of bonito flakes and extra oozy yolky egg.  Another texture win!\n3.  Seasoned fries- These were piping hot, extra crispy and perfectly seasoned.  \n\nConclusion:  If you have the late night fatty munchies, find fukuburger.",265,3

"Great furniture selection, but don't expect it to be a priority to get it to you. We paid outright for the perfect sofa sleeper and chair on a Saturday. (This is a prime example if why you should never finance furniture BTW) We are decisive shoppers and were pleased that we found just what we wanted and were in and out in less than an hour. Unfortunately the chair had to be ordered but the sofa sleeper was in stock, so they offered to make two deliveries. We turned that down because they said the chair would be in on Wednesday. Hey, I can wait until the next weekend... Well, Wednesday turned into Friday turned into Saturday turned into the following week. After getting the continuous run-around and no callbacks, they finally called and left a message saying that it would be another week due to the chair not being loaded on the truck. WTH is that? They kept telling me there were trucks coming and going all week. The payment sure cleared the same day! Needless to say, we cancelled the order for a refund. Somehow I have the feeling that the refund will be put through as quickly as the furniture was delivered. We will see if we have to contact the credit card company...

ALSO, there were two tour buses full of people that needed checking in as well but there were only two employees working the check in area. Once it was my turn to check-in I wanted to confirm with the employee that two of our three rooms were together and he said that they were not. At this point I was still calm but he said there was nothing that he could do, so I asked to speak with his manager...he said I will get her but she isn't going to do anything for you, at which point I became immediately pissed off.\n\nThe manager comes out and I explain to her and she said that there is nothing that she can do at this point because most of the rooms had already been checked into and that she will TRY to do something. I am completely okay with her trying to resolve the issue but her attitude and tone of voice were completely opposite of trying to resolve anything--at one point she started to raise her voice at me--THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! In the end, we got to of our rooms at least in the same building and one was in the building across the courtyard. The only problem is that after all of the hassle our room was supposed to have two beds but it only had one and we were not going to go back and waste even more of our time arguing with this woman who clearly had no concern what her guests thought.\n\nThe rooms were nice--a little out dated but nice nonetheless.\n\nThe place has three pools none of which were heated and there is only a bar relatively close to the first pool.\n\nThe first pool was a good size and offered a good amount of seating as well as a few semi-private cabanas. There were even two lifeguards working the pool on Saturday. However Sunday was a different story. We were laying out by the pool drinking and have a good time relaxing in the sun. There were about 10 other hotel guests at the pool as well--all appeared to be over the age of 21 if not 30 however we were all kicked out of the pool because there was not a lifeguard on duty. I took the issue up with the manager on duty that Sunday morning and she asked me for my room number-why she needed it I do not know--and that she would get a hold of the person who will deal with the issue of the pool being closed. I told her no, she will deal with it, I said \""You are the manager on duty, it is YOUR responsibility to deal with this situation\"" and she started to yell at me. I asked for the General Manager business card--her name is Sherri Erickson. I called today May 7, 2014 and left her a message regarding how rude her staff was and that I will be also complaining to Groupon about Alexis Park. \n\nThe second pool was closed the entire weekend--it was only filled up halfway-- and it looked like it hadn't been used for weeks.\n\nThe third pool was disgusting! The water was dirty--it looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a long time.\n\nAlso, WIFI is not free I believe it was $12.95 a day.\n\nLastly the brunch was awful! The orange juice tasted like it was some sort of powdered mix, the milk was luke warm, the potatoes were cold, the pancakes were stale... The eggs and the sausages were not that bad but not for the price that we had to pay AND the bar was not even open at that point (11am on a Saturday in Vegas!).\n\nI will NEVER stay here in my life and I hope that you will not either!",1039,0
Thank you for feeding my inebriated self some delicious sliders and fries at 4:30am. I actually am not sure if they were delicious or not but my friend said I dove for the last fry on the plate when she was trying to get me to head back to the hotel. I believe that and the fact that I ate 2 of the 3 sliders we orderd is an indicator that the food was good. Thank you for letting me think that by my friend and I wearing our sunglasses inside at that time that no one would notice how drunk we were. Finally thank you for letting me nap for a minute or two in the booth while we awaited the arrival of our food.,143,2
"I had been wanting to try this place since I saw the reviews in the paper and was excited to try it for brunch. I am sad to say the best part was sitting outside on a beautiful afternoon watching the tourists enjoy Charlotte. I ordered the eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast and although the bacon had a nice flavor, it was limp and very greasy. I liked that the potatoes were sweet, but they were tiny and hard to eat with a fork.. The eggs I ordered were supposed to be softly poached but they were hard. All in all, it was a fairly good meal but my expectations were higher for this place. I'm sorry to say I'm not sure if I will return.",143,2
"This place is ideal if you like having good tea somewhere that is not a dedicated tea house, with their attention to steap timing and their selection of leaves from Camellia Sinensis.\n\nBesides that, the baked goods are simply amazing. The regular food items are very good, but not quite on the same level of exceptional.",69,4
"I love this place! The casino floor is smallish, but more than adequate for some card playing, or if you just wanna lax on some slots. I think the Hard Rock Hotel is one of my favorite places in Vegas just for the overall ambiance. The decor here is classy, but has some STYLE. Where else can you go, get drinks and gamble AND listen to great music at the same time? Don't worry, I'll wait.\n\nI was hoping to hit up Vanity, but you never have enough time to do EVERYTHING in Vegas. I'm definitely visiting HRH next time I'm in town.",131,3
"The pho here is the best I have ever had - amazing broth.  The other food, I would not recommend.  There is another place just a couple of blocks away with better spring rolls/pork/shrimp/beef.  \n\nAgain, pho here is simply perfect.  But the meat dishes here are usually overlooked - beef has that over cooked beef taste, pork in the spring rolls also has that overlooked tasted, and the shrimps are cooked to the point of being dry.",101,3
"I came here for my first time..\nThe food and service was good. I had a pulled pork sandwich. The sides were tasty as can be.\nBut when I got home both, me and the person I came with. Came down with some sort of food poisoning.\nI would like to try it again, if I knew I wasn't getting sick.",76,2
"I see people aren't sleepin' on Mario's!  OMG, I'm getting home sick just thinking about their catfish.  As mentioned in other posts, it is fried to perfection and seasoned very well.  I only eat fried catfish when I'm in Vegas.  I've tried catfish in Minnesota and it was straight garbage.  I do agree, Mario's potato wedges are not the greatest.  I'm gonna have to try their mac-n-cheese next time I'm in town.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the westside, it is 'the hood' and a bit sketchy but the food is damn good.  Just head to the back and place your order.\n\nOh, seiously Scott D. \""Green fried tomatoes\"".  I have never in my life ever heard anyone call them that, let alone seen it in print on a menu that way.  They are \""FRIED GREEN TOMATOES\"" bruh. . . just sayin'",212,3
"The Cowfish is a unique fusion restaurant located in the Southpark shopping complex in Charlotte. To say that this place is popular is an understatement. Four of us arrived for an early dinner before taking a friend to the airport and the place was packed. When we left the restaurant it was the more traditional dinner hours and there were tons of people waiting at the bar and outside for a table. \n\nThe idea of a sushi and burger fusion restaurant is very unique and allows the menu to suit the needs of many different tastes. The menu is large there are both traditional and japanese appetizers and entrees. The Cowfish also has some interesting drink offerings including a wide array of alcoholic milkshakes. Our table ordered several hard milkshakes and an additional cocktail. Everyone was pleased with the drinks. For an appetizer we had the edamame flight which features four different seasonings (Sea Salt, Wasabi Ranch, Cajun Sriracha and Sesame Salt). The table loved the Sriracha but they were all very tasty. We also had a seaweed salad which was fantastic. For entrees, two people order the Cowfish bento box which features a mini slider burger, sushi, sweet potato fries, sweet and spicy cucumbers, and edamame. The bento box was good. You get to pick the sushi style and although not the best sushi I have ever had it was very flavorful and well rolled. The other people at the table got a sushi roll and a build your own sushi. They also enjoyed the sushi platters. Overall, it isn't the best sushi on the planet but it is good. \n\nIn closing, the food is good, the service was alright, and the environment is trendy. The place is trying to do something different and I cannot fault them for that. This is a place that you will be happy you tried since it is so different. Like some other reviewers, there were some ordering mixups and some food didn't arrive or was delayed. However the manager came over to us, explained his regrets, and made sure that everything was taken care of. Very much a class act. Personally, I would go back and tell anyone to check this place out.",444,3
"I used to go there on and off for about  two years due to proximity to my house NOT  because I enjoyed the place. There are two male bartenders that had absolutely no concept of customer service - acted like you should be privileged that they were taking the time off from either watching TV or talking to other friend \""customers\"" to serve you. The clientele wasn't much better - very \""clicky\"" and not the best specimens of society - \""trashy\"". I eventually stopped going in there altogether after I realized the short, four block commute was just not worth it. \n\nThe customer service will never get better. I guarantee even if someone whom works there sees this review will absolutely care less and probably laugh because that is how this bar is.",158,0
"I have been going out here in Las Vegas for 13 years and I have been to almost every venue on the strip. \nMy friend and I are up laughing at our experience here and thought we would share.  I normally, if you check my profile, I give 5 stars and have never given a 2, but this place can leave you feeling disappointed if you have watched the trailer. Hopefully they will pull it together, they are new, so take this as constructive.\nWe unfortunately were sat at the table, combination stage where in performers would jump up on our table with their shoes on lol and dance around our table all while the waiters were yelling at us to grab all of our glasses, pretty funny. This happened several times and the waiters would grab all of our stuff and clear it off as the next pair of shoes hopped up and danced, it was crazy.\nThe food portions will leave you heading to in and out burger after, they are super tiny, and the oysters were the size of a nickel, you receive 4 for 16.00 and all of them wouldn't add up to one full sized oyster anywhere else, I don't like them but my friend was bummed. \nWe were in a group of 6 people and the waiters would drop off the small app plates and not put them in front of the guest that ordered, some if it was confusing looking so at one point we had asked the waiter where our lobster dish was, and he cruised down the table and grabbed a 3/4 eaten bowl of lobster and brought it down to my friend and said there you go, your friend must have eaten it. \nWe had a lot of servers but none of them able to take an order, only the one could, but unfortunately he was very busy, and so half the table ordered without him getting the other half of us, then they served half the table and we had to wait while everyone was passing the mystery plates around.  It was pretty impossible to get the service you would expect because there were a lot of people but only one guy that could take orders. We had to wait a long time for our drinks.\nThe food, what little of it there was, was wonderful.  \nThe flatware and dishes were gorgeous too, and the music was 1940's I think and very beautiful.  The musician that played the organ in off tones was pretty crazy sounding, but I'm sure it was supposed to be like that.  The entertainers were very talented. \nAll in all, it was a weird experience, great food, terrible service and interesting goings on.  Very over priced, but great for tourists to see.  It was one of those places that are fun to do once.  Maybe if I was a drinker it would have seemed better.\nWe spent $700 dollars on our dinner bill and we were all hungry after.  Pretty funny. \nSorry to give you the low score, your new, so maybe in reading this it will help you to improve so that you can last for many years to come",645,1
"First if there is a way to give zero stars, I would give it. \n\nI took my friends with his kids and my family there for lunch while visiting the city for a trade show. Shame on me for not reading the reviews!\n\nWaiter: The waiter, like others reported on their reviews, was the owner. He was rude, impatient and not interested in providing a traditional service. My son is only tow years old, and ordering a whole meal would have been a waste. So, I politely asked if I could have an extra plate. Waiter was fast to add that he charges $5 for sharing a plate. The first time I heard of such foolish charge.  Our table was in an area where the waiter couldn't reach three of my guests, and we told him that we can pass things down to him. He got upset and made a snappy remark. \n\nFood:  The food was about average.  Most of us ordered the same dish, and we all had meat that were not cooked all the way. We mentioned it to him at the end of our meal just to bring it to his attention. \n\nAll and all the experience was horrible, and I do t recommend this to anyone.",260,0
"I want to give them that fourth star but we've had just enough mediocre experiences to make that not possible for now. Still, you could havea great time on any given night.\n\nWe find the nightly specials to be very worthwhile: Fried chicken on Mondays, St Louis ribs on Wednesdays, and deep fried turkey on Sundays have all been good. The wine list is good as well, and they have beer and wine specials at various times of the week (see their website for details).\n\nWe have had one or two nights where the service wasn't the best and one night when the food really wasn't done as requested, or even well. The nights with poor service, I have no idea if this was the fault of the server or the kitchen, but they aren't charging Denny's prices and I do expect better follow-through than we had those nights. For that reason, the fourth star remains to be awarded.\n\nBut we'll go back, hoping to have a night that gives us reason to award it.",219,2
"I wouldn't even give this place one star.  I was walking downtown with some friends and happened to see Thai Elephant (whose Tempe location is fairly good), so I convinced one to go in and split a dish with me.  It costs two dollars to split a plate, which is fine, except they didn't even give us an extra plate and seemed angry that we were sharing (also, didn't seem very college-student friendly in general). The waitress just plopped the dish down and walked away.  There were very few waiters working a packed lunch crowd, and this meant the waitress gave us the check immediately after giving us the food, and then someone else came and took it before I even had time to ask for a box.  \n\nI'm not too upset that I didn't get a box; the food was as awful as the service.  We ordered the drunken noodles with tofu, and it came with thin pad-thai noodles instead of the wide rice noodles--seems like they were being lazy in the kitchen.  Save your money and support better restaurants downtown.",228,0
"This review is purely for an ORDER FOR DELIVERY- via Grubhub.\n\nThe western lake beef soup was great. Fair portion for 9.99$\n\n\nGreen beans w. Minced Pork - 10.99$ on grubhub, tasted TOTALLY HORRID. Portion was equal to that of a 6$ dish, will not be ordering for delivery again.\n\nBased on all the positive reviews, maybe I'll come in to eat... Portion must be bigger than a small round container for 11$\n\n\nP.S. Grubhub being the excellent service they are, gave a 15$ credit for this order.\nUnfortunately the restaurant was not kind enough to give a fair portion.",160,0
"Pancho's is great if you like eating dog shit.  This was honestly some of the worst food I have ever eaten, or attempted to eat. All, I MEAN ALL, of the food is frozen and tasteless. The enchiladas were smothered in a sour tasting sauce that undoubtably came from a can. The taquitos were inedible, you would find better ones at the gas station. The tamales were unexplainably bad. To add to the wonderful dining experience at Pancho's, the clientele is fat, morbidly obese, diabetics who shovel mountains of this god awful food from their plate to their mouths. You couldn't pay me to eat here again!",142,0
The service was consistently bad. No reason to wait 15 minutes with only two customers in line. Way over priced also.,27,0
"My husband and I are huge cake boss fans. We've visited the bakery multiple times, met buddy, and even ordered birthday cakes from Carlo's. He's such a nice guy, and his family is so genuine. \n\nOf course we had to try one of his newest additions. We showed up on a Friday right when they open, at 11:30a. We were seated pretty promptly. Our server was friendly, but not very authentic... Kinda 'going through the motions'. Too early to be at work I guess.\n\nWe ordered a pizza and a sausage and pasta dish. Both were very tasty and average sized, not huge but not small either. \n\nThe decor is very authentic Italian, and has a homestyle kitchen vibe. Really spacious with tons of seating, only the weren't too many people dining , that day at least. \n\nI'll be back next time in in Vegas! I hope others will too!",207,3
"Located in Corta Bella gated community, but if you do not live in the area, simply tell the gate attendant you are dining at Anacapa and he or she will raise the gate for you without question. Anacapa's service is superior, very nice ambience, great view of the outdoors. \n\nI have been here for the Xmas Eve buffet, April 15th Hawaiian buffet, and lunch during the week.  All were excellent.  The chef is truly amazing here!  The lunch quesadillas w/steak were delicious (definitely ask for extra salsa as it comes in a very small cup), and the buffet selections for both occasions were great!  This is my father's favorite restaurant, and I'll have to say it's by far one of the better restaurants in the area. \n\nPlease do not make this a resident-only restaurant!",185,4
"To start off, the food at this place was really good. They had a great menu, big wine selection and awesome bread starter. Normally when you show up with a party of 8 or more, if the hostess can find a way to seat you she will do so without seeming to annoyed by it. That was not the case with the hostess on the night we visited. We planned a last min dinner and had 10 people, and expected it to be a stretch to get seated anywhere together. They had several tables available on the front deck of their restaruant but it took them about 20 min to push them together and let us sit down. Again, not a big deal because we had a big party and did not have a reservation. Overall, the food was really good but it seemed like our whole meal the hostess was staring us down and the waiters were not so happy about our party size... if its such a big issue just say no next time!",199,2
"Took some guests in from out of town and it was so LOUD that we got up from our table and went to Bar North to dine outside....same menu, but not quite what we had hoped to experience.  Tiny round tables to dine...just because the employees may like loud music, let's not forget who pays the bill!   I ordered brussels sprouts and they arrived and they weren't even trimmed up....an oversight I hope.",93,1
"They are over priced for what you receive.  Simple things like ice are not provided.  The place is in need of repair.  The chairs are worn out, tables are shoddy.  They did not set up enought tables so our guests had no place to sit eventhough I paid for more guests than we actually had that night.  Also our coordinator who was supposed to be available to me and by my side all night..no where had to hunt her down everytime.  Also watch out all their vendors like Bartender Bob are a joke.  DJ was poor as well as the serving staff all recommended by the Wright House.",131,2
"The food is BAD, even for bar food.  I'd rather go to any number of other Bars in the area to eat.  The service is Also BAD, another problem.  Dining area was almost empty and we had to constantly look for our waitress.  I wouldn't recommend it, too many other better options.",69,1
"I had breakfast here today with my Cousin, childhood friend and of course the Mrs.\n\nWe arrived at about 9:30 and had a 15 minute wait. It was a good way to catch up with the family. \n\nWhen we were seated our waitress Teresa came right over to take our drink orders. She was also very helpful answering any questions we had about the menu. \n\nAfter deliberating over the menu my wife had the Jr plate (three pancakes, one egg and two sausage links). I had the buckwheat pancakes with scrambled egg beaters and corned beef hash.   My cousin had the two by four platter and my friend had the pigs in a blanket. (I was tempted to try the Dutch baby as mentioned in other reviews but then I would have needed a nap). \n\nEveryone was very satisfied with their food. You get a lot of great food for a great value. When we left there was a thirty minute wait and now I know why. Timing is everything when coming here.",216,4
"I don't write reviews much but this one is worth writing about so others can enjoy this place as well. My wife happened on this cozy place on her way to Dovecot Tapestry Studio (worth a look as well if you are visiting Edinburgh). This cafe/deli highlights authentic, local foods in a very casual, friendly atmosphere. The breads on offer are the tastiest I've had ever and do try the traditional Scottish breakfast with the \""black pudding\"" (a kind of blood sausage if you are unfamiliar) which is very good on it's own as well.",118,4
"I was at BLT Burger on September 21st and the service was HORRIBLE.  When we first arrived, we weren't greeted by the hostess and when she sat the party in front of us, there was no smile or eye contact.  My party decided to sit at the bar and it took a long time to get the bartender/waitresses attention.  When we finally did get her attention, she was condescending and unfriendly (her co-worker was equally unfriendly).  We decided to leave a 2% tip due to lack of compassion and service.  With the high prices and poor customer service, I would not recommend BLT Burger to anyone and I won't be back either.",147,0
"The food is awful. If you haven't tried real mexican food you may like it, otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.\nThe place seems to have a good atmosphere but then you will realize that it is as any other restaurant.\nThe worst was Chicharron de Queso and the Bloody Mary. The ingredients were not fresh.\nWe waited like an hour to get a table inside on Sunday afternoon. Then, the hostess asked us to accept the table outside, otherwise we should wait more time.",106,1
Stayed here for the weekend in Tempe and we really enjoyed it. The hotel was really nice and clean. Everything in the room was updated. There was a heated pool and hot tub. They have a business center and exercise room. There was also a restaurant. My favorite part was the bed. It was very comfortable and soft.  They greet you with a warm cookie!!,76,4
"Visited in early December.  We beat cover and got a great table.  They absolutely rake you on food and drinks.  We planned our visit with every intention of eating dinner and drinking there all night, but no go.  I asked about bottle service for our table to avoid having to try to communicate with the waitress when the place started to get loud.  She didn't know nor was she interested in find out for us.  Ich.\n\nDrinks and food were concert venue or amusement park prices. \n\nThe Piano players were constantly asking for suggestions but throw your request on the floor if it doesn't come with a tip.  Would be much easier to have some little sign or primer of 'how things work'.  \n\nThe premise is fun and the guys were really entertaining, but that's it. There is no such thing as comfortable seating in a place like this, and be prepared for the guys on stage to single you out if you catch their attention.  And they won't be nice.",217,1
"Sir Ed's is a little hidden gem in Park Road Shopping Center that not nearly enough people know about. \n\nInside, the low ceiling and dark accents give this place a total Irish Pub feel. Outside, the patio seating is a nice little quiet sanctuary.\n\nThe menu here is very vegetarian friendly with lots of comfort food to choose from. Sir Ed's has a large bar with lots of beers and and an adequate on tap selection.\n\nMy favorite appetizer here is the Irish Potato Cakes ($6.50). Two large crusty cakes with a warm herb goat cheese sauce. Delish! \n\nI usually order the Spicy Asparagus & Portabella Grilled Cheese ($8.25).  This sammich is served on sourdough. It's a nice change from your typical grilled cheese. The veggies inside are perfect, but I wouldn't exactly call them spicy. Order comes with a side, I almost always get the french fries... large \""steak fries\"" with a strong potato flavor.",213,3

"The best takeout/delivery pizza in Phoenix. Forget Papa Johns or Pizza hut. If you are in delivery range or pick up distance to a Barro's you will not be disappointed. The quality of their meat and veggie's is fantastic. Feeling the pizza craving? This is your best bet. \n\nThe crust is not too thick, not too thin, soft but crunchy, (is that possible?) YES. They are not heavy handed on the sauce, but combine a perfect blend of topping, cheese and tomato sauce goodness. The true test of a good pizza is either plain cheese or good ole pepperoni. Both from Barro's are excellent. They are a family joint, local and fantastic!",146,3
"I've been to Gus' Cafe a number of times since it opened and I've been waiting to give it a fair review. So glad I waited! \n\nThe change in chefs and staff was just what Gus needed. The negative reviews here on Yelp are, I think, now in the past. Inconsistencies in the availability of menu items - no pickles on hand to make the signature fried pickles, running out of salad mix at 11:30 a.m. or staffing problems - chef busy talking on her cellphone instead of getting food out, inattentive waitstaff - are issues no longer. If you want a damned fried pickle, you can HAVE it because this kitchen staff remembered to order pickles! \n\nSo let's look at what Gus' does right. Starting with the fried pickles. Long spears of tart, green dill pickles, coated in a crisp, crunchy, slight spicy batter accompanied with a creamy fresh dill dressing for dipping is an absolute must for me. The best part is you'd never know they're gluten-free - that extra crunchiness is because of the rice flour used in the batter. You do know that Bobby Flay uses rice flour in his fish batter for the ultimate crunch, right? \n\nSuggestion...why not make the most of that light and crunchy batter by adding fish and chips to the menu? Big, crisp onion rings? Fried zucchini? Take advantage of what you've got going for you!\n\nIf lemon crepes are on the menu, don't miss them! Light, sweet, tart...and again, gluten-free. You know, I really hesitate to mention that almost everything is gluten-free. I think some people assume gluten-free is substandard to gluten-FULL. Not true at all! \u00a0Oftentimes, gf is better! The fried pickles for instance. \n\nThe fries are awesome, the tots are amazing...don't make the mistake of ordering more than 1 order for your table as they come heaped high on a cafeteria tray! Honestly, you could share an order with a couple of tables. Order them plain or with toppings of your choice. \n\nEverything above sound big time fattening? Maybe. So order a great big salad or great big delicious omelet. Mexican-ish items abound...tacos, enchiladas...even the abovementioned tots get a south-of-the-border twist.\n\nOh, and Gus's has a full bar so brunch can be accompanied by a bloody Mary or Bellini if you so desire or a fine craft beer or two with dinner.",549,3
This gym is decent at best. I joined a brand new lifetime in another state for 70 a month. Then I moved to Gilbert and they lowered my payments to 65 a month. The gym is pretty old and crowded. Locker rooms smell like piss. \n\nOverall it's decent but I'm a single guy just looking to workout and I can find plenty of great places less than 65 a month! I do not use classes or kids zone. \n\nOn top of everything if your looking for a family or spouse member getting added on THEY DO NOT HAVE FAMILY PLANS. So 1 person was 65 bucks a month. 2 people a month they will do 120 bucks a month. 3 people is a little over 150. Save your money and look elsewhere.,174,1

"The food was good, so why one star?  The ambiance was lacking, specifically the music was intrusive.  A very loud heavy beat going pound pound pound. It was like sitting next to a car with a loud stereo at a stop light.  Seemed very incongruous.\n\nI asked the waitress if it could be turned down, she replied cheerily \""sure\"".  Then the manager came over and said it was all or nothing with the music.  I requested nothing and he said he couldn't  do that.  \n\nAppetisers were good, ordered a pasta dish Strozzapreti.  Made sure garlic was not included  in the ingredients on the menu.  I know what would one expect at an Italian restaurant, garlic is common and usually listed.  I have a reaction to garlic and avoid it.  You guessed the rest, the dish has a normal amount of garlic. \n\nService was not terrible but far from memorable.  My biggest complaint is the loud music.\n\nI have to add the food was good, the experience disappointing.",230,0
"The first time I came here, I had an average experience- it was definitely not the best sushi I've had in Montreal and I even thought to myself it was rather unworthy of a return. \n\nThen, for some reason beyond me, I was desperate for sushi one night and decided to order from here. It was one of the few places I could order from, so I went for it. I paid an arm and a leg for an order that could have been amazing, but was far from it. I woke up in the middle of the night with extreme pain in my stomach that I had never felt before and spent an hour (on and off) vomiting. \n\nTwo words: FOOD - POISONING.\n\nBye.",157,0
"Smog Inspections in Nevada especially for those of us who have seen a Colorado inspection are laughable annoyances that you just want to get over and done with. There's a lot of places in Vegas that can do smog checks...Jiffy Smog sent me a coupon in the mail though and that's what got me to their door. \n\nThis particular Jiffy Smog location wasn't much to look at from the outside, but the staff working here understood what Jiffy means. I was in and out in under 10 minutes and I liked that alot. I don't know if all of the other Jiffy Smog locations have it but this location has the option to let you pay the DMV registration on the spot for an additional fee. This can be helpful if you're severely time challenged or you don't want to find a kiosk or endure an actual DMV office visit. \n\nOverall...when I need a smog check this Jiffy Smog location will be on my short list of places I'll go back to. 3 Stars",223,2

"Breakfast service was good, prompt and friendly. This place offers your typical American breakfast fare at a price which is average for Vegas but more expensive that anywhere else in the USA. We had the corned beef hash with poached eggs. Nice. However table over from us had to send their breakfast steak back because it was gristly.\n\nI was tossing up to give this 3 stars. But the main thing that let it down was the $3.75 charge for brewed coffee.  The coffee was just terrible and I resented paying for it at any price.",118,1
"Best liquor store in Vegas..Nick hooked us up. Best spot ever, very close to the MGM. Very professional, I will be back. Me and my boys were looking for a place to go, and it was right across the street",49,4
Buffalo Wild Wings at frankloyd is awesome so we thought we would give this location a try.  After the service i had the other day i will never return. We were sitting at our table for 15 minutes before being served. And let me tell you the place was empty the servers saw we havent been waited on for a while and still never came to at least take our drink order for us. ( which you as a restaurant should work on.)We had to flag the manager who saw us sitting there for a while. The waitress we had was beyond terrible and shouldnt be working there. Empty glasses everywhere. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!,130,0
"The staff here are very nice. They really try to help with any financial issue one might have. I'm new to IRA's and Mortgages but they were able to answer all of my questions and gave me their personal office line for my outside lenders to contact them in case I needed help. I really appreciate the extra help, finances can be extremely overwhelming and good help and education is hard to find. I have been a customer since I started working and NSB has always been an amazing bank.",103,2

"If you have been to a Native before this one is not much different, which can be a good thing. This Native is split pretty much equally into 2 parts - the restaurant and bar, and you can eat and drink in either one. Best day to go is on Tuesday when they have their 25 cent wings special - which remains one of the best in town!! Good pizza and wings and cheap beer make for a fun, friendly hangout, but definitely not a singles hot spot. The reason for the 4 star rating, is that their carryout service is a little lacking - if they say 15 minutes, better be ready for 30. I have wasted a lot of time in that lobby! But the wings are always great!",154,3
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday because I heard they were known for good steaks. The ambiance here (Rea Road Location) is real masculine with the dark wood and dim lights. He really enjoyed the decor and felt it was fitting for the occasion. \n\nWe got the Lobster Spinach Queso and OMG it was so freakin good! I pretty much ate the whole thing myself! He got the 14 oz Ribeye and I got the Wood Grilled Salmon. Yum to the salmon. It was cooked to perfection! It came with parmesan mashed potatoes which were creamy and good. Nothing like I have ever had before. My boyfriend enjoyed his Ribeye of course and it was cooked Medium just like he wanted it. He claims it was one of the best steaks he has ever had. \n\nOverall Firebirds is great and the service was awesome. Fine dining at its best!,182,3
"This bar pretty much sums up everything that annoys me about the Theatre in one go. It's a bit gaudy looking, it's painted stupidly flambuoyant colours and the shakespearean life-sized figureheads suspended above the door are just a little too desperate and attention-seeking for my liking. And on the one occasion I drank here it was full of people that pretty much matched that description too.\n\nYes, it's a really convenient location if you want a few drinks before you see a show, as it's pretty much inside the Playhouse building. But that fact also means that drinks are really overpriced. Obviously the other reviewers liked it considerably more than I did, but I have to say I am definitely not a fan.",155,1

"I got the bacon, egg and cheese club. Good, but not amazing. It's on par - if not slightly better - than Panera. I would recommend this place if you're in the area for breakfast. In fact, the bacon was worth 5 stars. \n\nPrices aren't bad either - for what I got and a coke was just over $10.",83,3
"I took my friend to Cibo for his birthday a couple of weeks ago. He had been before and I had not (so I guess he kinda took me). \n\nI ordered the Rustica Bianco Pizza and i believe he ordered the Diavola add basil. The food was delish however my Rustica had so much arugula on it it looked like a salad on top of my pizza. I'm talking a VERY unnecessary amount.... whatever, I just removed 3/4 of it. We had almost finished our first bottle of Pinot Noir before being seated so we had another along with dinner; it was a great compliment to the food. It was a Friday night and the wait wasn't more than 45 minutes, not bad in comparison to Bianco. All in all we had a quality experience. \nThe bar seating is very \""close quarters\"" and if you're like me and you don't like strangers sitting in your lap I recommend imbibing someplace else.",205,3

Worst place for service.  Manager was above clearing tables to seat people. The waitstaff was more into chitchat then serving customers.  Will never be back. My mom was in from out of town and was going out to lunch with her. Will not take clients here either.,59,0
Worst place ever food was cold my wife food didn't come out complete didn't offer to change they didn't even give us a notice or a discount nephew food was cold like it was siting there waiting on the rest food this place is a joke!

"I would give this place a 3.5 stars. Their pastrami sandwich was good and the bread was very fresh but price was a little steep compared to their burgers. Their hand-dipped shake was awesome, so much better than Steak & Shake. They even gave us the extras in another cup. Great service too!",67,3
"I've been there many times and they are always very good. When you go out to eat with five people ordering five different things, usually one is not happy with their meal. This is not the case at Casa del Sol. The staff is great, the food doesn't take long and the price isn't bad either.",69,4
"Having two teenagers that spend every summer scuba diving off the Catalina Coast, it was not a matter of if we were going to visit the new SeaLife Aquarium at Arizona Mills, but when.  Not wanting to battle the grand opening crowds, we decided to wait until a midweek hot summer morning.  Arriving there at about 11am, 3 busloads of summer campers arrive just as we did and are escorted into the aquarium.   Ugh, we decided that a loop through the mall and maybe some lunch before we go see the fish.  \n\nCampers gone, we explore the aquarium with only our ankles under assault.  WHY DO THEY ALLOW STROLLERS IN SUCH A SMALL SEMI LIT, CONFINED SPACE?  Moms, do us all a favor and leave your stroller in your car.  If your child is not old enough to walk, this aquarium is not age appropriate.  That said, maybe management will read any of the current 3 reviews posted on Yelp and realize that strollers are a MAJOR problem.  The aisles and space between the exhibits are just too small to accommodate strollers and the crush of people.  \n\nThe exhibits are kind of cheesy.  Plastic coral and lots of fake looking rock work. There is a funky smell. (No, it does not smell like the ocean!)  The lights are very dim and there are some poorly lit artificial rocks scattered throughout that everyone seems to scrape their legs on.  All the acrylic is scratched and cloudy.  It is extremely overpriced.  Not just expense,  EXTREMELY OVERPRICED FOR WHAT IT IS.  Should be $10 at the most.  It takes about an hour to see everything.\n\nBut...\n\nThis is the best public aquarium in the state of Arizona.  Sad reality.  \n\nSo, if you would like to expose your family to the wonders of the ocean, go.\n\nJust be aware of SeaLife 's major shortcomings, (and leave your &$*% stroller at home!)",427,1
"Amicus Apple offers a lunchtime menu offering a range of dishes for \u00a35. I chose the steak and ale stew, which proved to be really quite tasty. As a no-nonsense plate of sustenance, it was a winner. The place is quite smart, plays its music just a notch too loud, and is a good stop-off on an evening out. The cocktail menu is very decent, too.\n\nOverall, we said: \""though I have severe reservations about the term \""gastrolunch\"", I was quite impressed with what the folks at Amicus Apple delivered. I like the notion of being able to pop in to somewhere like this, get a dish that's high on flavour and low on complications, to fuel you for the afternoon ahead. In that regard, it's much like the lunchtime offering at The Rosehip. I'd happily pop back, and would be entirely comfortable with suggesting that you do likewise.\""",198,2

"I've found over the years, that trying an Indian restaurant during their lunch buffet is by far the best value, and a great way to try new things without being disappointed if you don't really like it. I love chicken tikka masala, unfortunately Mint's didn't really tickle my fancy as much as I was hoping it would. It was good, but not as flavorful as I'm used to. That being said, they had other dishes that were delish! I liked their chili chicken, and chicken vindaloo. Their garlic naan was fluffy and yummy, and both rice dishes were good. GIve this place a try!",134,3
"I love the ginormous language barrier here. Bring your token Chinese friend, because asking what each thing is will lead into a 5minute banter back and forth trying to figure out what the hell each party is saying.\n\n- \""excuse me can you say it in english?\""\n- [server] \""I AM speaking english\""\n- oh. shit.\n\nLuckily, it only takes about 4 guesses and 6 people to decipher what she was trying to say. God. We are so whhhhhite.\n\nBut on to the food. Yelpers are right on the money, the very little money it costs us to eat here. With 6 people and no holding back on ordering everything (cause \""what the hell\"" and \""we're hungry\"") until we were going to explode, costs us $53.35. For you math-enthusiasts, that's about $11 per person, tip included.\n\nAnd did we say we were exploding at the end of our meal? Like, \""I need to hold my food baby and care for it\"" full. Like \""I need a nap, immediately\"" full. \n\nSo, you may ask (or maybe not, I'm not telling you what to do), why the 3 stars? Were the quality of food is just A-OK, tasty but nothing out of this world. We stick to the siu mai, pork dumplings, shai long bao, egg tarts and Chinese broccoli. My favorite dim sum dish (of all time) is the sweet bread bun filled with pork. They make it here with mostly sweet potato vs bbq pork.. which made it sweeter than it needed to be (and less meaty). My friends enjoyed the shrimp noodle dumplings and we thought the roasted veggies were nicely done- crunchy but with tons of flavor. Not the easiest thing to pick up with chopsticks though.\n\nOf course, no one had the balls to try chicken feet. I don't get it. Its delicious, and has nothing to do with my foot fetish. Mostly. Sort of.",439,2

The whole menu looks good and I would definately go again..staff was very friendly.,84,4

If i get comped again then maybe i might come back, back until then i'm going there only for Tabu nightclub and Fat tuesdays. thats it. you would have a much better experience if you stayed at the MGM Grand Signature.",153,1
"Visited on Saturday night and had a great time.  We got their a little late and wanted to relax from walking the strip. This was a great choice,  the staff was excellent , attentive,  professional, courteous, friendly, welcoming. I was even surprised the staff was asking me what I would like to hear music wise. And my music is not for everyone but the staff gave it a try and played some of my music.   The prices for hookah were reasonably priced considerably.  You get quality product here at this lounge. When back in Vegas I will come again.",118,4
"The concept is good. The decor is great, and the employees, although yes, they are young as some people pointed out, they were very friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, a restaurant comes down to the food.  It always comes down to the food, and in this case, it was not good.\n\nIt was 6:30PM on a Friday night, and the place was empty, which should have been a warning, but we went in anyway.  The protein in the warmers up front was old, old, old.   The only thing that saved our meal was the fact that we both wanted tofu, which is cooked to order.  The rest of the food (the rices and vegetables) were also old, bit not as critical to the dish.  You can keep rice in a warner a long time and its still good.\n\nWe sampled several of the sauces and they were all wonderful, a nice blend of sweet and spicy, good texture and color, I can't say enough positive things about the sauces, but unless something changes with the other food, this place will not last.  Especially when the official Chipotle version of Asian food makes its way to Phoenix.\n\nA couple came in after us and left because they didn't eat tofu, and I don't blame them.  I understand that you don't want to waste food if there are no customers, but its a vicious circle because you won't have customers without fresh food.  Why can't all of it be cooked to order? At least until you are constantly busy?  \n\nFor those sauces, \nI would wait.",347,3

"So we decided to give Sammy's another shot after being invited back by the GM. SO glad we did!! The service was much improved this time around, we saw much more of our server, Alex, than we did of our server during our last visit. We had the dumplings (finally!) as well as their calamari, both of which were awesome. We also enjoyed their flourless chocolate cake. Some of the menu descriptions don't do this delicious food justice. We were thoroughly impressed not only by the display of exceptional management but also the fantastic server we had who not only made suggestions but also ensured our glasses were never empty and our plates didn't sit for too long. I hope this was not a fluke and I truly hope that Sammy's is striving to improve their customer service. As for us, we will certainly be back and recommend to friends in the GV area. I hope next time around the service and food are just as consistent. Thank you Sammy's staff for restoring my faith in the customer service industry!!",211,4
"The perfect IItalian restaurant in Old Town Montreal!!!!  The venue and service is delightful.  The food is excellent, especially the homemade pastas.

At the end of the meal our friend and  the waiter took us to meet Mama in the kitchen.",82,3
"Nice little hole in the wall. Used to come here regularly and it was my go to place. One thing tho, their rice and beans used to be the tastiest simple fare. I dont know if they changed something but not as good as it used to be. And didnt they use real silverware before now its all plastic. Also management needs to school their new help in customer service and cleanliness. Last time at least two of their workers just standing around doing nothing while empty dirty tables were not cleared away. From great to just a okay but will still check in once in a while. \n\nHint : Step up your game NMG. You do have competition. Meanwhile Ive discoverd a new place in Gilbert that is not such a hole in the wall, Nearly the same prices good food and customer service.",166,2
"The beer selection is amazing! They have specific glassware from the maker for every beer I have had there. The mussels are really good and come with a huge thing of frites. Definitely have to share unless you are starving. The bartenders are really good with selections if you are overwhelmed by the 4-5 page beer list. They have some of the common beers from around town but I find it much more exciting to get a little adventurous. I highly recommend trying one of the two sour beers listed. I had bigger expectations for the goat cheese salad and it almost pushed me to a three star but I realized we didn't go there for a salad we went for the beer, mussels, and deviled eggs! All of which were spot on!",152,3
"This is strictly a Spanish speaking restaurant. \nIt is not like the service we received was less but our waitress did not understand a word of English and the only people there were speaking very loudly about bar room brawls and \""pulling guns\"" on guys who were hitting on their \""girls\"". I in no way think this is reflective of the owners or staff but I bring it up so yelpers can decide for themselves if it is a family friendly location. I would not want to take kids there. The potions were good, but the quality was average. I did not dislike this place but would try to find a better restaurant next time. The neighborhood seemed fine but I was frightened by the activity in the parking lot.",148,1
"This is the third time at Dessys. The service staff is kind, attentive. The steaks are so good I don't have to add A1. The salad bar is fresh and clean. I will suggest this place for anyone that wants to enjoy a good meal for a great price. Dig the Native decor too ;)",66,4

"I stumbled upon the Spotted Donkey by accident. I thought it was the other restaurant that used to be at El Pedegral (now closed). Lucky mistake I made! \n\nI've been there a couple times since then and have loved every dish! Keep in mind I grew up near Mexico and lived there briefly, so I have a very selective taste for Mexican-inspired food. The guacamole is above average, but not the best I've ever had. The salsa is nothing special. They main dishes are the standouts here. My favorites: \""Silver Coin\"" margaritas...  they are phenomenal! I'd imagine they're made with fresh lime juice and a simple syrup instead of a sweet 'n' sour mix. The beef fajitas are perfectly seasoned and are quite a feast, so order them if you have a big appetite. The signature tacos are also quite delicious. My favorite by far has been the pork tenderloin over their green chili mac and cheese is amazing. Great combo of flavors - one of my favorite dishes around town!   \n\nWe've never had enough room for dessert, so I can't offer a review on that. I strongly recommend Spotted Donkey. I'm going to introduce some friends to it this weekend and enjoy this nice weather on their outside patio.",272,4
"great sports bar. TV's galore. Good food. Outside patio. While many places claim to be sports bars, for some reason they wind up not paying attention to the TV's and wind up with hair removal infomercials playing.\n\nThis place knows what they are doing with the tv's. I was watching the manager who looked like had a spreadsheet with every game planned out and on what tv's. They also play the sound from the premier game.",100,4
"There are few things in life that make me truly happy. Babies being born, sunny afternoon trips to hang out with a few buddies and maybe the most important one of them all, really good food! The problem with most BBQ places is that there are those who have come to believe that throwing a few pieces of meat on the grill followed by a massive coating of sickly sweet sauce is real BBQ. \n\nWhy then would people spend long hours tending smoke filled pits that sometimes look like they came off the back of a old tractor or the family car? Simple because it is NOT REAL BBQ UNLESS IT IS COOKED LOW AND SLOW!!! The smoke is as important as the meat itself when it comes to making lip smacking Q. It not only adds flavor it also adds a nice smoke ring that lets you know that the meat you are stuffing in your face is real BBQ and not some baked in the oven, made at someones mom's house, under flavored mess. I should have known better than go to a place that claimed to be masters of what they call Chicago style BBQ. \n\nFirst off there is no such thing as anybody with a real taste for BBQ knows there are five main areas or styles. Memphis, Texas, St. Louis, Kansas City, and South Carolina style. Chicago does not even come close to making this list. Each region offers a different take or variation on BBQ and those variations are almost like a calling card that informs others as to the origin of the food they are eating. The food from this place did none of those things. This was my first time visiting this chain restaurant so I went in with eyes and nose open to all they had to offer. \n\nIt is no secret that when I walk in to your business that three things must happen in a matter of seconds or I am gone. First off the place should be clean not just look it  (clean floors but disgusting bathrooms). The staff must welcome you or at least acknowledge your presence, and finally the prices should be clearly marked along with the items being offered. As I said this was my first time in this place so I walked in and took a look around. They seem to have really put a little time and effort into creating what they believe is the ideal Q eating establishment. Clippings of newspaper write ups on the company founder, the food and even local charities they help (nice). They even have what I like to call a BBQ battle station. \n\nThis consisted of three bottles of their sauce in various stages of flavor and heat levels, malt vinegar for those who enjoy a more vinegar based sauce, and even ketchup for little kids who do not like the BBQ sauce.  Note: the lack of wet naps that are often handed out at BBQ places should have tipped me off to the lack of sauce issue they have. They do offer free drink refills which is nice given that the cups are on the small side for what they charge, I believe it was $1.59 for a small or $1.99 for a large unless you get a combo meal then it comes with your meal. \n\nThe prices range from $2.79 for a Vienna Beef Hot Dog to $14.99 for one of their three meat dinner combos. They also serve Italian beef sandwiches ( the reason I ate there in the first place) which tasted OK but the jar peppers they used over powered the meat and made the bread soggy. I also tried the beans and rice which seemed to be just that and nothing more! No salt, pepper, not even a little shot of onion or any flavor enhancer to be found. Their potato salad was on the sweet side as if it had been made with miracle whip or sugar was added either way yuck. I also had a few bites of their pulled pork sandwich which did have a nice amount of meat but REALLY lacked in flavor. \n\nThe meat was almost mushy and only had a small splash of sauce. Now normally some places drown their sandwiches in sauce resulting in everything being overpowered with it but any real BBQ master knows that the sauce should only be added to enhance already well prepared meat. It can not make up for over/under cooked, under seasoned meat period!! But this is one of those times I think it could have made the food better. So to sum it all up I would recommend this place to those who are looking for a OK Italian beef place in the Mesa area but as for the BBQ I would suggest you let this little piggy go otherwise you will be the one crying whaa all the way home LOL.",938,1
"Yet another fabulous Yelp event held at this locale. Great food.....and I am not a Mexican food lover at all....but again the food was very good.

I'm determined to try everything on the menu here. The mochiko fried chicken strips are amazing not too greasy. The meat is tender and juicy and the breading is perfectly crispy.

"I stayed here during a business trip in April 2013.  I was excited before I arrived because it was my first time in Vegas.  However, this quickly faded.  My room was not what I expected in fact I have actually stayed at Holiday Inns that were better.\n\nThe furniture had ink writing/drawings on it. The windows were very dirty, and 2 nights I had no hot water.  Not to mention WIFI is charged, and there the room only has basic cable.  Once again Holiday Inn's offer free WIFI and HBO.  The elevators are horrible graffiti and missing wall mounts.  They writing and scratches all over it...reminded me of the mall elevators.\n\nMost of the staff at the check in counter are very friendly but the rest of the staff not so much.  I called to get my hot water fixed and it took 25 mins for someone to come to the room.  Then the maint. guy step with his dirty boots all over the floor mat.  The hotel did not offer any comp. for the bad service.\n\nThe best thing about this hotel is the outside area...its beautiful with the water falls, ducks, birds, and fish.\n\nI am looking forward to going to Vegas again but I promise it WILL NOT be there.",277,0

They will not take appointments  so here I am at 11:30 am and must sit here until 5:30 pm to get my car aligned. All about the service, aren't they? Btw all locations are the  same.",84,0
"I bought my Civic from Zimbrick four years ago and have taken it here for service ever since. Until today, I had excellent service and the rewards program is what kept me coming back for oil changes even though I paid more than I could have elsewhere.\n\nToday I was a walk-in oil change/tire rotation. They were busy but assured me I could be out in 45 minutes. If they'd quoted me longer, I would have come back a different day, as I realize I didn't have an appointment. \n\nI waited in the waiting room -- with my three month old baby -- for an hour and a half. Finally they came and got me, stating that my paperwork had been accidentally left on someone else's desk when someone went to lunch. The technician apologized but did not go over the inspection sheet with me like they normally do.\n\nThen I got out to my car and it wasn't even washed! If I'm going to pay $45 for an oil change and tire rotation, I at least expect my courtesy wash, especially with these terrible salty winter roads.\n\nI was late for my next commitment and my baby was hungry at this point. My vehicle is seven years old and I don't need to be taking it to a dealer for service anymore. This was the tipping point. I won't be coming back.",290,1

"As Emmy said in an earlier review, I really wanted to like this place as well, my wife loves them (yep again proving how subjective food can be) I found them to be, well ok, nothing amazing and over priced.\n\nA bacon cheeseburger with mushrooms, the burger patty itself was ok, the mushrooms were fine, the bacon overcooked and something I really hate on something that is supposed to be a good burger, processed American cheese.\n\nWhy oh why take a good basic foundation and ruin it with a slice of processed cheese, then charge $6.99 for it ?\n\nOur fries were good, not great but good and I really do think chains such as this and In-N-Out set themselves apart by using freshly cut fries.\n\nSo in the end, a semi good meal, not something I would rave about, when it comes down to it, a double double is better in my book and half the price.\n\nSo in the end, two burgers, one large order of fries and two sodas, $25, to much money for the product.",233,2
"We've been coming to this particular location for over 7 years at least 3 times a month because we always received the best service from our server, Fey, who just happened to not be working this evening.  we were looking forward to having the \""2 for $29\"" entree & wine dinner.  When we arrived, there were only 2 parties of 2 dining.  There were 3 servers & no manager.  We received no greeting & were told to take the 4th booth on the left.  We were neither walked to our booth nor handed menu, whatsoever.  We sat for 15 minutes without one serving coming over to us at all, not even to give us a menu or even offer us water.  We both stood up & walked around & still every server ignored us.  We stood at the cashier counter for about another 5 minutes, expecting the friendly attentive manager who usually checks us out so we could make him aware of our disappointment.  all 3 servers walked by & still ignored us.  so, we left & landed at to Coco's on Bell Rd. & 98th Ave., only to be greeted & served as we're to be served.

"My son and I wanted a quick cafe meal and stoped by this restaurant.  I ordered the prime rib my son ordered a sandwich.  I ordered my prime rib rare and told the waitress that if the did not have rare to let me know and I would order something else.  The sandwich came out fine the prime rib was well done.  I asked to speak to the manager who came out and was completely rude to me.  I then ordered the chicken parmigian and waited 20 minutes for that to come out.  When it came out the chicken was burnt, which I felt was done on purpose.  By this point I just wanted to leave, since nothing was comped I went to pay for the dinner and the cook was standing at the counter he asked me how was dinner and I told him it was horrible.  He then began to insult me.  This restaurant clealy does care about it's customers and the food is horrible.  Will never return.",203,0
"The Thirsty Lion is another very good restaurant that's so close to being five stars.\n\nThe begin with the staff at the front door are great, so nice, so helpful, just wonderful.  \n\nMake your way to your table or the bar and unfortunately you'll be greeted by an arrangement of unnecessarily uncomfortable seating.  The bar stool while soft are backless and meant for a night club.  At the table you'll get either a cheap wooded bench or a wooden chair without lumbar support.  This is not the kind of restaurant that needs to force you out quickly so I'm not sure why the seating so terrible.\n\nThe staff though, they are a different story.  Be prepared to think this is your local dive because the staff will treat you like your one of 3 people in the either establishment, they're simply just great.  The staff will really make feel like you belong here.\n\nFood...now that's complicated.  The menu is so much more expansive than any restaurant of comparison that you'll be hard pressed to not find at least one item that tickles your fancy.  The complication come in when there seems to be at least one awkward ingredient in each dish.  If you're not pick them you'll fare well.  I myself am very picky about my bread items and for instance, the buns and bread that accompany the burgers and sandwich really fall short.  They're tasteless flavor mops, whatever flavor you find inside of they're amazing burger is sucked out by a dry bun akin to styrofoam.  \n\nThe drink selection here do not disappoint, whatever kind of beer you like they'll sure have something to fit your pallet.  They also have a great assortment or wines and an expansive mixed drink menu. \n\nThe Thirsty Lion Pub does not disappoint, well at least not across the board.  They're indubitably better than most in the area.",414,3
"UPDATE:  They have reached out to me after seeing my review and offered to       re due my daughters nails.  They would like a chance to rectify the situation.\n\nInstead, I asked that the $6 over charge be refunded to me in which they agreed.\n\nI never went back for the $6.00 but it was nice to know that they would do what they could to resolve the issue.  \n************************************************************************************\n\n\nMy experience:\nThe salon I regularly go to is right around the corner so that is how I found out about this place.  I saw they were new and wanted to give them a try.\n\nI took my 12yr daughter here  yesterday for a gel manicure.  She is trying to stop biting her nails so I thought the gel may help. \n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\nWow, this place is modern, clean, and well decorated.  It did not have any of that cheesy decor or horrible paint on the walls like a lot of salons.  This was fresh.\n\nThe unique thing about this salon that sets it apart from other salons, is that the manicure stations were set up at bar level.\n\nThere was a movie playing on a couple flat screen TV's and the volume was loud enough for us all to hear.\n\nWater was offered to everyone which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nTHE MANICURE:\nMy daughter says:  The nail tech was more gentle with her than the other place we go to and she could easily understand what was being said.\nShe didn't like that the nail tech clipped her nails (remember she's trying to grow them out, and they were already really short, so why clip them?).\nI told her she should have let the lady know she didn't want them cut.\n\nWhen my daughter was asked if she wanted a design, (She knows I don't like paying extra for that stuff) she asked the nail tech if it were free and the nail tech told her she would do it for free for her.  \nWhat she got, was a clear coat w/glitter and the tips painted teal.  This looked ridiculous bc her nails are super short so painting the \""tips\"" looked real funny.\nI didn't say this to my daughter bc I didn't want to hurt her feelings.\n\nCHECK OUT:\nUp at the register, the nail tech says that she painted the design for free.  I thank her and thought that was really nice of her.  She tells me my total is $30.00\n\nThis fee is higher than the place I go to which is $22 for a gel mani, but being that this place is new, I figure this is the prices they are charging.  \nI pay, tip, and grab a pamplet to take home.\n\nOnce home, I go over the pamphlet to see what other services they have to offer and check the price she told me.  \n\nTo my surprise, a Basic Manicure (which is what my daughter got) cost $12.00\nClipping, shaping, cuticle trimming, massage and polish.\n\nAdd the gel polish $12.00 that would have been $24.00 so where did the nail tech get the total of $30.00?\n\nShe over charged me, or she in fact, didn't give the design for free like she said she did.  Either way, I got ripped off.  I will not return to a place that is dishonest.\n\nFor that reason, I will not recommend this salon.",793,1
"I'm amazed I haven't reviewed this place yet since I go here so often, strange. \n\nAnywho, I'm knocking it down a couple of stars because of the last time Matt & I dined here. \n\nGot seated quickly inside, and made our orders after getting our drinks. I got the bowl of lentil soup sans cheese and a falafel pita with hummus and fries. Matt got the unlimited pasta bowl, and his first round was bowtie pesto. \n\nService was alright although our waitress was a total ninja and disappeared a lot so if we actually did need things it would have been very difficult to find her. \n\nMy food was very good, although I think that the soup is a bit overpriced but still very yummy. I'm not a fan of their hummus at all but when it's wrapped inside the pita it's good, and the fries are always bits of pure heaven. Matt however, wasn't a fan of his pasta and had half of the big bowl left. He still wanted a second bowl of something different, and asked if I could take the rest of the pesto home as leftovers since he didn't like it. The waitress said due to policy they can't box up the first round of pasta. \n\nOkay, I would understand if Matt didn't completely finish his second bowl and kept asking for to-go boxes, but come on. I can't believe that they just wasted all of that food that I would have gladly ate for lunch the next day. They need to change the policy that you can only take home one portion or something. That policy just totally puts me off from coming back as soon as I usually do. \n\nOverall the experience was alright but wasting that food is upsetting. I guess from now on we won't be so adventurous with our first bowl. The food is always good usually though and the service is alright (although I can tell you a funny story about a waitress who kept blindly spilling water on my friend throughout the night - too hilarious) but I don't think I'll be back for awhile.",445,2
"This is a review from a spectator's point of view of the World Series of Poker 2012, whose Main Event just opened at the Rio and will continue until the composition of the Final Table is determined on July 16th.  I sort of blundered into watching a slice of this event as I emerged from the Penn & Teller Theater after their show near 11:00 p.m., and ran into a steady stream of intently focused, mostly backpack-carrying men in their 20s and 30s in all manner of dress, and a few women, swiftly moving into the Rio's Convention Center, where 300 poker tables have been set out to accommodate tournament entrants from over 100 countries, most of whom had to plunk down a $10,000 entry fee to play here.  I joined the deluge, and entered this cavernous room where the tables were set out.  It was only a few minutes before another session was to begin, and I was lucky to secure one of only a few seats that had been placed for spectators near the tables.  As tables filled up and the cards began to be professionally dealt, at first I watched the action from a distance from my perch.  But then I recognized one well-known professional player with a reported $10,000,000 in past poker tournament winnings already under his belt, and saw where he sat down.  And, when I noticed that spectators were freely allowed to stand behind players in banded off areas, I joined in for a much closer look.  Thus I was able to stand directly behind Gus Hansen, affectionately known in poker circles as \""the Great Dane,\"" and watch him play a few hands with a full table of players before I opted to buy some nice souvenirs and head for home.  I noted that other players seemed to be a bit intimidated by Mr. Hansen, and quickly folded their hands when he made an aggressive chip raise.  But he did not bully his opponents, immediately tossing his cards away after the first round of dealing multiple times.  Except for flopping over cards to seek contested chip piles, while cards dealt to players were not visible to onlookers as is often the case on TV, it was still interesting to see the interaction and moves of the players, most of whom nervously rearranged their piles of chips or repeatedly manipulated a few chips during the course of a hand.  And, ultimate decision making by the players I watched was mostly reflective, methodical, and slow.  \n\nThe tournament itself appears to be very well organized and professionally run, and poker media and spectator friendly.  I didn't see any signs forbidding photography, but only observed cameras being operated by crediential-wearing professional cameramen.  I definitely recommend that all amateur poker enthusiasts come out to the Rio even if only for a little while, and watch the \""big boys\"" play at this year's WSOP.  I intend to return soon myself, next time with my poker-loving and poker-playing wife!",633,4
"Extremely overpriced for what they give.\n\nI ordered a shio (sea salt) flavored  basic bowl ($8) with roasted chicken (+$1.50). \n\nThe basic bowl is $8.  The description of a basic bowl is : served with pickle bamboo shoots, scallion, spinach, carrot flowers, naruto (fish cake) and nori (seaweed).\n\nIt had ONLY one 1 inch diameter naruto (fish cake) of may be less than 2cm thickness.\n\nMay be 2-3 similar slices of carrot. Similarly, 1-2 thin-thin slice of seaweed. That should give you an idea of what the basic bowl would look like. (I should have taken a picture.)  \n\nI was very disappointed. The noodle was not well cooked, the soup was very salty and not tasty and the amount of accompanying veggy/fish-cake etc. was way too little. \n\nI was really looking forward to a decent eating place in this location and am extremely disappointed. \n\nI was planning to take my wife and friends there; but  will take them to real noodle places in Tempe.",250,0

"The Last Drop was the first bar I ever went to in Edinburgh, where I ordered a vodka and coke (standard, the Malibu, Peach Schnapps and Aftershock chaser phase was yet to happen) and sat around staring at people and looking uneasy. What do my alcohol choices  of the nineties have to do with anything you might be thinking? Well, nothing really, I just took the chance to have yet another reminisce about my early drinking years, because the novelty phase when you first start drinking is definitely the best.\n\nAnyway, about the pub, being situated where it is, right in the Grassmarket, Last Drop is part of a busy strip of pubs, which are always heaving with people. Last Drop is a lot cosier and welcoming looking than some of the others, and there are some nice booths to sit down in and settle with a drink for the night. Just a nice wee pub really, no complaints. It will be absolutely rammed during the festival in August, but then again, where isn't?",214,3
The service takes the cake. Food has been fresh and delicious both times I've eaten here; I have had the pad thai and orange chicken. The Thai tea is sweet and rich - very tasty. I checked-in on Yelp and received a free order of spring rolls. And the owner gave me little cup of soup to enjoy while I waited for my lunch (lunch special is $3.99 btw). It's these little details that make this restaurant worthy of every star!!,100,4
"I used to really like this place because it's totally chill mode and the drinks are creative and typically well-made. My last visit here was with a party of three on a busy night. Three of our five drinks were lackluster at best, including my old fashioned. If DCR can't even craft a good old fashioned any longer, then it's all over folks! My friend couldn't even drink one of his menu cocktails because it was just that bad. It tasted like a m\u00e9lange of top shelf cough syrup. He sent it back in what he thought would be an exchange for something more palatable, but the drink ended up on the bill anyway. When you're charging these prices, especially right now, you should be more attentive to such things. Because I've been here many times, I may give the place another shot. But honestly, this experience leads me to believe this place may have jumped the shark in terms of consistency in quality...",205,2
"We only stayed here because it was the cheapest of the options in our deal.  The elevators are saunas when it's hot outside.  Our room was about a quarter mile from the elevators.  We had two rooms; one on the 15th floor and one on the 12th.   In order to get from one to the other, we had to go all the way to the first floor and take a different elevator back up.  The rooms also have no fridges.  House keeping was pretty good and it might be worth it for the price we got.  The casino doesn't smell too smoky.",132,2
"My wife and I were really looking forward to trying a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype.\n\nThey've got a silly iPad drink menu that they bring around to you when you are first seated.  Unfortunately it does not work AT ALL.  When browsing it the app locked up on us and crashed twice.  The table next to us chimed in \""yeah, that happened to us too\"" and the table on the other side said the same thing.  After they left and someone new sat down at their table, they also had problems with the app.  So 4 out of 4 of us had problems.  If this happened to Gordon on Restaurant Nightmares I can just picture him screaming at the GM \""what were you thinking you donkey!\""  Lame.\n\nThe food was decent, but not amazing.  The portions are huge to match the also huge prices.  Dinner for 2 for my wife and I was $170.  Overall it was fine, but it's no better than any other decent Vegas steak house, but here you're paying a premium for the Ramsay name.\n\nOverall, the only amazing thing was the sticky toffee pudding.  I don't even have the words to describe how delicious this was.  Unfortunately that was the only stand out part of the evening.  Skip Gordon Ramsay Steak and get the sticky toffee pudding at his pub or burger restaurant across the street.",308,1

"I heard such great things about this show, so I was really looking forward to seeing it and then very disappointed with the end result. \nWhy I didn't care for it:\nFirst, you definitely have to be a fan of synchronized swimming. It's 80% of the first half of the show. Also within the first half, there was so many things going on in various places of the stage, I wasn't sure where my eyes should go. \nThere really isn't a storyline, it starts out as having one and it very quickly vanishes. It really is a dream, as none of it makes sense, lol. \nThe second half got a little better for me when it really went into what you expect out of a Cirque show - the: \""How did they do that?\"" factor. \nOverall, I could recommend many other shows over this one.",187,1
"This place is pretty close to my house, a nice walk to the Southern Highlands shopping center where they have a Smith's and other small restaurants, the only thing is that although convenient to where I live, pretty much all the food places here are about a 2-3 star restaurants including Tutti Bella, they don't have as many flavors as Yogurtland in Town Square and I don't think they had as many toppings either.  I do enjoy the cleanliness and freshness of the fresh fruit though and added a star for their frequent buyers card.  * My yogurt of choice here is cheesecake and chocolate topped with mochi , crushed almond roca, corn flakes and sprinkled with almond powder.....yum!",143,2
Great service but their system in AZ sucks. Why do you have to call a toll free number in Scottsdale to make an appointment in Goodyear??? Makes no sense. In NV they list each location phone number so you can talk direct to where you want to go--not in AZ.

"We couldn't wait to try this restaurant. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. We started with cornbread muffins. My cornbread muffins are much better. And I'm not a professional chef. Then we had the po' boys and gumbo on the side.  The bread was delicious; the sandwiches overall were just alright. The catfish po'boy had the fish put in last so it was only in one bite in three.  That gumbo was not what I was expecting it all, it looked and tasted like pork stew. No seafood, barely any andouille. My father and I were eating and having the exact same thought: \""I miss Baby Kay's.\"" Unfortunately this place is quite a bit more expensive than Baby Kay's was. I don't think I'll be back.

"Hailing from Scotland and having lived for a while in England, I occasionally develop a hankering for some good, English pub grub. I stumbled (no, I wasn't drunk despite the stereotypes that exist about the Scots) across a flyer for Churchill's during a visit to The British Shop on Thomas and Hayden (SW corner) and thought I'd pay it a visit one night with my family and satisfy those cravings I'd been having.\n\nOvercoming the fact that this pub was in a strip mall (unusual as anyone from Britain will tell you), I stepped in and was immediately greeted by a very friendly co-owner with an authentic, English accent. \""Boy, they weren't kidding when they described this place as quintessentially British, were they?\"" I thought to myself. True to form, premier league (English) soccer (or football as we Brits tend to describe it) was playing on every television set. A dart board lay off to the side and a pool table occupied the space adjacent to the bar. I also noticed some posters, which were advertising the pub/restaurant's quiz and karaoke nights -- both hallmarks of a decent establishment back in the old country believe it or not. The next test for me was the menu.\n\nI wasn't going to be disappointed. All the classic, British pub favorites were on the menu, e.g., bangers (sausages) and mash (mashed potatoes), bubble and squeak (tasty concoction of potatoes, cabbage, and leeks), shepherd's pie, and of course, fish and chips (fries -- you'd be surprised how many people screw that up). I chose the fish and chips and thoroughly enjoyed my meal with a little malt vinegar and just a dash of salt and pepper. The organic apple cider (alcoholic -- we don't have non-alcoholic cider back in Britain -- we call that apple juice)  was quite excellent. My husband (the designated driver that evening) drank the coffee, which he swears was better than that sold at Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. He paired this with the prime rib, which he claimed was perfectly cooked in between mouthfuls. \n\nAt one point during our meal, the owners came around and asked how everything tasted. Why is it everyone has a knack of asking you that question  when you're in the middle of chewing? Anyway, after hastily swallowing our food, we duly informed him that we would be returning for a little taste of home. I was very impressed by the overall quality of the food (yes, quality is a word that can be associated with British food), as well as the friendliness of the staff and owners. \n\nThis is a great place to meet up with friends (even with kids -- they love the pool table) and enjoy a relaxed meal and a couple drinks and I'll definitely be doing that on occasion with my friends. Five stars!",602,4
5 stars for the customer service (thanks lili)\n4 stars for the food \n5 stars for the apple pie & coconut cream .... Goodness... And perfect bacon. \n\nDid not like the old diner old old feel. I'm a stickler about clean glassware and utensils and everything was so outdated & used so much 1/3 of the logo is left - as clean as it may have been - felt unclean. \n\nI got a veggie omelet - super delish and they use whole florets - cooled perfectly. \nBacon - perfect & crispy .... So Worth the calories. \n\nThey vale all of their desserts there and everything we ordered was incredible. Pie crust was flakey and soft - I would come here again - staff is super friendly.,164,3
"Nice, big international airport.  Close to Phoenix, off sight rental cars and great restaurants and amenities. Tram service because the airport is so large and spread out.  TSA lines were abnormally long and short staffed to say the least....15-20 minutes to go thru security is too long!",62,2
"I feel bad about giving this place two stars... really.\n\nLast sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.\n\nWe approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing. \n\nTheir pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.\n\nI loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. \n\nThe cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. \n\nThe service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. \n\nTo my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot. You might need to shoo away the owner though in order to get some privacy and enjoy the people you arrive there with.",724,1

"Bummer! \nI'm from SF visiting AZ for a debate program. Went here to grab some cheap eats. Long story short, the waitress overcharged us. When confronted, she said she had no way to fix the error. Whatever ... That was annoying. My friend requested salsa and when told she had to pay for it, she made a genuinely confused face. The waiter (different one) said awkwardly \""you don't have to look at me like that.\"" It was a weird vibe killer.\nMoving on\nFood : bad. Had a Torta that was overly sweet. No free chips , you pay for salsa. Tacos were weird too. One tortilla, no salsa to put on them. \nBut the cardinal sin here is when she offered to get me a beer, she lagged because she was busy flirting with men around. Listen sister, we had a long, hot ass day in Arizona. The least you could do is get me a cold beer, on time so I can drink while my friends are eating. Not chug a beer before we have to run. \n+ one star for the bartender who spoke to me and gave me a discount. Really nice guy.

I don't think the staff like their job very much because all they do is stand around and chit chat with other staff members! No greeting, no hello, no \""hi, can we assist you with any luggage today? NADA! They look bored, lifeless and simply not happy! Not even a SMILE! First impressions are very important! If you're not going to embrace your job whole-heartedly, then I suggest you look for a different job that's less rewarding! Customer service is very important! Especially in the hotel industry business! Upon check out, guest services didn't even bother to ask us if we enjoyed our stay! Nothing at all! \n\n3. If you're going to charge a $25.00 resort fee, you better make sure that the internet works at least! I just think it's ridiculous especially since it didn't work most of the time! The hotels nickle and dime you for everything in the resort fee, but we didn't even get to take advantage of it!\n\n4. Front Desk - you guys are the front lines of this hotel and if a customer isn't happy and is addressing a concern, you should take matters into your own hands and resolve the matter! Instead, what do you do? Offer us water! Seriously? What is that? Wow! That was really disappointing!\n\n5. Bayside Buffet - this used to be a very classy restaurant, but when we ate for dinner, the food was mediocre and tasted like it's been sitting there for hours! No wonder this place was empty! They charge $30+tax per person for dinner and honestly, their food isn't worth the amount you paid for! That's more than the M Buffet Restaurant and that place had better food! The people that worked there just kept talking to other staff members and when you ask them about a particular item on the menu, they look pissed off because you interrupted their precious conversation! \n\n6. Shark Reef Aquarium - Old. Outdated! For $18 you can tour this place in less than 10 minutes! It's sad because upon exiting (when you view your picture), they're suppose to be happy and excited to show you the pictures taken, but instead we were the ones who were greeting the staff and smiled at them and asked if they were doing great, but all they did was smirk and chuckled! Apparently, they weren't enthusiastic about anything! They were bored out of their minds! \n\n7. The rooms were okay! But the TV is so old (it's a plasma and there's not alot of channels to choose from)! The entire hotel has a dark and gloomy feel to it! They need some major changes to the rooms!\n\nIn conclusion....I'm not really thrilled to talk about this hotel and everything inside of this place! I should have just kept my reservation with the ARIA hotel since we've never stayed there either! But we just wanted to give this place a try! Other  that than, I suggest you yelpers look for a different place to stay!\n\nBEWARE: they're going through alot of facelift renovations during this time! Alot of places (cafes, lounges, restrooms, etc.) are closed. I hope they'll consider improving their customer service while they're at it! Don't even bother with addressing your concerns and issues. No one will get back to you to fix the problem or compensate you for the inconvenience! :(",963,0
This place is amazing! my friend and i went here to check out the place and we were treated like kings. My friend works in Capital Grille Seattle and we got the hook up. Drinks was good too and the food are phenomenal! Definitely going back here. The service is top notch! Everyone is nice and our bill was on the house! We ended up eating at least $250 worth food = ] \n\nAmazing place definitely a place to go eat up if you are in Las Vegas!,104,4
"The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like.  WARNING!!!  You will want to spend money!\n\nOn average their prices are pretty run of the mill dept. store style, it is their selection that is amazing.  They have far more selection than any other store I have ever been to.  The store is also well organized and laid out and everything is easy to find.\n\nOne final note, while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals.  I just purchased all of our appliances for our home at a 20% discount.  Again, not the best discount I have seen but getting them all at once, not having to look around, and still getting $2 back for every $10 I spend is pretty darn nice!\n\nOh and if you need appliances, ask for Andy/Andrew... He is a great help and honest as can be!",211,4
This places was great we had the torta and some street tacos.  It was great would go back again.,23,4
I found this place while hungry ad driving down Cave creek road. I ordered the Pad Thai for lunch.... Fantastic!,24,3
Good club. Good music. Has two levels. On on the roof top. It has decent view of the strip on the roof. Normal high vegas priced drinks. Bartenders were cool. Wasn't a super long wait for how many people where there. Go VIP and you dont have to wait in a line long at all.,68,3
This place is great!! My favorite is the fries!! The hot dogs are so good (I recommend getting two if your hungry) I also LOVE the gyro. I highly recommend this place!,39,4
"we came here for my fiances birthday bc he loves the mastros back at home in Beverly Hills. I'll have to say it's not comparable. the service was excellent. as always. however their steaks we're just not up to par. I ordered the filet mignon, medium, and it came out well done. I wanted to say something to our waiter but I didn't want to ruin the vibe celebrating my fiances birthday. everyone else in my party thought their steaks were just okay as well. they had the bone in rib eye. \n\nwe also ordered the cream of corn and fries. the cream of corn just... didn't taste good so I don't recommend getting that. the fries were typical and not so bad.\n\nI don't think I'll be coming here anymore when I come to Vegas. I'll just stick to buffets.",188,2
"The owners are the same, but the end of Boston's came about a week ago. They decommissioned themselves from that chain and from the looks of the fancy menu and new plates and the sprinkling of parsley to make plates look pretty, these owners are trying to capture a higher end crowd perhaps. The menu is small now and incomplete and they still have appetizer specials for $5. I ordered the pretzels with cheese sauce. It was basically one pretzel cut up into seven pieces, but was served warm and the cheese sauce was good, but needed a bit more of a kick perhaps. At $7.99, that appetizer would way less appealing to order. Since these owners are from Minnesota, it seems they are trying to inject Midwest values as the feature item was the Juicy Lucy burger. One poor guy at the bar waited at least 45 minutes for his burger as they are probably working out the kinks back there. They claim to be having pizza again soon, but they will need to update their kitchens because the bartender told me that Boston's just used a conveyor belt system to cook food.\n    Nothing changed on the staff and they are all still nice, but the entire bar and restaurant was empty at 6pm for a good 1/2 hour. They have added a bunch of new beers and Tuesday is supposed to be a day where beers are $2 all day. I still go once a week there, so will try more food next time.",301,2
"This is one of the only bakeries near uptown that offered a savory bread loaf, so I gave Local Loaf a try. Pecorino Rosemary sounded perfect, but it was a bit disappointing. This bread did not taste that great straight out of the bag. However, once I doctored it up, it was very nice. After brushing with roasted garlic olive oil, oven toasting and sprinkling with salt and pepper, it made a great base for bruschetta and artisan cheeses. However, I would not spend $6-$7 again for a loaf of bread that needs this much work. \n\nBased on other yelp reviews, I will be back at least one more time to try their lunch sandwiches.",146,2
"Man, I was disappointed considering this place had an average of 4 stars! I frequently visit Yi-Mei and Noodle Pot so maybe I have already found the gem's of Chinatown/Taiwanese food. The beef noodle soup is ok, but there was only one noodle choice. We also got the pork rice plate. Another Yelper also wrote this and we had the same problem...isn't that pork supposed to be fried on a rice plate? It wasn't a deal breaker but just a little strange. The food was just so-so and our table was dirty when we sat down. This place needs to be seen by the health dept and needs more sanitizer in their sanitizer bucket.",142,2
"After my car accident, I went back to ANNIE @ lash lounge to get my eyelashes fixed! \nMy car was totaled and is was the mourning of my birthday. \n\nI was very upset, injured and suffering the birthday blues! I was on the verge of tears as I told Annie they had taped my eyes shut for a CT/MRI scan and had pulled out a lot of my real eyelashes when they ripped the tape off; she reassured me that I could get them restored and told me I was pretty :)\n\nShe worked meticulously for an hour first removing the adhesive residue from the medical tape and carefully cleaning each lash, then she gave me the most beautifull fringe of lashes! \n\nI was so happy I took selfies and posted to FB!",162,4
"Average mass produced coffee...served with a reliable smile. \n\nPluses include daily horoscope, clover coffee and reliable baristas who prep your order while you're in line if you stick to a regular drink. \n\nDraw backs are limited outlets and less seating since the remodel.  Avoid the sun by sitting at the common table. If you need an outlet, sit along the bar near the restrooms, at the common table near the column or on the round tables in the back corner along the Capitol side windows.\n\nOutdoor seating when weather permits.",118,2
"This place is fabulous. \nFriendly and fast service and sick food: we had oysters, saba, edamame (recommended by our server for being unique; it was), a couple robatayaki skewers and a platter of super-fresh nigiri. My wife said he wanted to move in upstairs and eat there every day.\nThe prices will creep up on you so beware (though they were worth it to us for such meticulously prepared and sourced stuff).\nIt has a somewhat casual vibe in both the service and decor (Cure is like that too), which I like, but may not appeal to everyone.",126,4
"Well lets start with the fan favorite, the view! Incredible view. We where there for the right time, 630ish with the sun setting and the casinos turning on all there lights. So I read some reviews, and one caught me, it talked about dress code. And I agreed with the reader. If youre suppose to dress up, dress up. I dont want to see people coming up in shorts and tees, But thats just me.. First impression of the place. It was fun, the art was diffferent. Got the hostess, and she directed my girlfriend and I to my parents, where they where at the bar. Decent size bar, the bar tender was nice. We then went to our table, and was greeted by our waiter. Our waiter was okay, but wasnt the best. For the amount of money you spend there, he should on his game. But lucky for us, he was a nice guy. \n\nThe food came out in a timely fashion. The steaks where cooked to what we asked for. Everyone enjoyed there food, was quite delicious. We where to full to have dessert. But they looked amazing. Instead we had coffee and tea..Also before I forget. Get yourself the Total Rewards card, It definitely helps saving some money. So if you want to save alittle money go check it out.. \n\n Afterwards we decided to head up to the voodoo club. And that was a whole different story on its own.",303,2
"Had the basic breakfast bagel (sausage, egg and cheese... pepper jack, specifically) and it was ze bomb! Their sausage is an actual one cut thinly into perfection. It doesn't make you question the contents. I will have to keep coming back to try the other gazillion things on the menu- so many options that I had to go basic.",74,3
"I really want it to like this restaurant I love  Mexican  food. But it was not what I expected to be the food took a long time to come out , we waited 30 minutes. Once we received the food it was not hot it was under cooked. It did not taste authentic  it tasted like it was old & it sat out for a while . My sisters stomach was in pain that entire night eating there. My enchilada was HORRIBLE. we will not be coming here again ever . worse so called Mexican food we have ever had.",116,0
"Solid buffet. As my usual at a buffet, I was looking for prime rib and shrimp and got both. Crab legs were a great bonus. The sushi rolls were \""meh.\"" Lots of good choices and I never got anything that did not taste good. Would go back for sure.",58,3
"what a cute \""expensive\"" little place...we didnt even take a bottle of wine and it cost us $65.00 each. \nWe shared a tartar, was ok $12.00 and small...we each had a main meal, cod fish in miso, was ok $26.00 and very small...glass of white wine each $11.00, perfect...and shared a bread pudding $8.00, AMAZING! i had an alonge $3.75. total $112.39+tip\ni'll go back, but for a coffee and the bread pudding!\ni didnt understand why its so pricy, i mean the rent cant be all that expensive in that area and the portions are very tiny? \nin my opinion, either they should lower their prices or make a little more generous portion...",183,2
"I don't mind Hooters, the restaurant or the hotel really. A previous reviewer said to think of the hotel as an expanded restaurant - spot on. The  rooms are cheap, clean-ish, and cheap. There have been upgrades and you can tell some of the previous issues with cleanliness have been addressed. In a pinch I'd stay here, maybe. Stay away from the casino.\n\nCheap is nice but I've been disappointed. I spent some time and money at the craps table today and I think they might be playing dirty pool. I was about 10 minutes into a roll, shooting for an 8, when I made the point. The dealer paid out myself and several others on a clearly marked 8, however as we are reaching for the money another manager told him to take all of the money back as one side of the table was marked with a 6 and our side the mark was on 8. No further explanation was given. On opening roll I was told the point was 8, dice read 8 on the first roll, I rolled an 8 for the win, but the casino didn't pay out. I kept going and hit the 6 in the end but I have no trust in the casino or management. Stay away.",266,1
"The food was outstanding and the service was exceptional.  The food was prepared perfectly . We started with guacamole and a trio of salsas. They were all just right. My wife and I also ordered two flights of tequila to go with our apps which exemplified the difference between everyday tequilas and the unusual selection that is available here (the owners selection and the daily special).  The liquor went down very easily along with the fresh warm chips. I ordered carne asada prepared rare and it actually came out perfectly rare which is the exception not the rule around town. My wife had pollo enchiladas that were delicious.  The dessert was a wonderful Latin take on apple pie with cinnamon ice cream that alone would  bring us back.   The waiter, Kevin, was attentive but not overbearing and provided us with everything that we needed. We were able to course over selves and did not feel rushed. Verde might just be my new favorite. I am definitely going back and you should try it too.",202,4
"This location is much better than any of the others I've been to in the easy valley. Very clean, very friendly staff.",28,4
"We sat outside on the patio. It was a beautiful Sunday morning, the perfect ending to a very fun girls weekend. I had the waffles with strawberries and tahitian vanilla bean butter. YUM! My friends had a  puffed pastry breakfast special that they said was delicious.\n\nA little overpriced for breakfast food, but its Vegas so its to be expected. Overall a good dining experience. Will definitely be back.",87,3
This plaza must be the pinnacle of Ethnic Mesa.  The supermarket is diverse where many different Asian languages are heard.  The aisles are packed with food.  Overflowing.  The produce section is very large and so is the meat section.  There are some swimming fish to buy and groceries representing every type of Asian.  Oddly clean as well for an Asian grocery store.,78,3
"I hate using the 'Race' card. And most all my friends would know I hardly ever use it.. Close to never... \nHowever.....I'm going to use it here at this place tonight.  My money is as good as anyone's money.. I wanted to enjoy a dinner experience with my parents.. \nJust because we're Asian... At a 'Fancy' Asian restaurant, we were treated like 'Asians'.. Meaning 'No respect'.. \nWhen the food arrived, they handed my food 'Across' my mom's face to give to me...the whole time eating.. NOBODY came by to ask how we're doing..\nThe table beside us, a 'White' family... When their food arrived, they were placed in front of each diner... Without reaching across another person's face...\nAnd had SEVERAL servers came by to ask 'How was your food, how are you doing, everything ok??'\nI had to flag down a waiter/waitress to refill my iced tea.. \nIt's so sad these people are so ignorant to treat other Asians like this...\nAnd it's too bad they are like that, cause I actually enjoyed the food. It was a bit pricey, but the quality was there. \nI would recommend everyone to come here if I had a better 'Service' experience. \nSo if you're white... You'll enjoy this place. If you're Asian... Don't expect service.",312,1
The place was clean.  They do encourage you to take out. Order was wrong peirogies mislabeled asked for mushroom  was labeled mushroom got meat.  The stuffed cabbage was undercooked  hopefully it was just a bad day for the kitchen.,52,0
"Overall, I had a good experience here. The room was nice enough, though the bathroom was kind of small. We couldn't figure out if the lamp shade in the room was dirty or if it had a weird design on it. It kind of looked like someone spilled coffee on it. But it was a minor thing. The lobby and casino almost always seemed to be really crowded. Trying to get to your room from the self-parking garage at night was challenging at times. But what I really liked about this place was the friendliness of the employees at the table games. I am new to gambling and the dealers at the roulette table I went to were really friendly and helpful about answering my questions. The blackjack dealer I had tried to help us out and was nice to talk to. We were able to find $5 minimum tables here, though it was during the week so it would probably be different on a weekend or holiday. I would stay here again because of the nice dealers and pit bosses and because of the Mirage's central location.",211,3
Meeting rooms that trap you like the little rat that you are.

"I knew it wasn't going to be the Venetian, but I didn't know that black oil-like substance would spew from the tub mid-bubble bath...\nNo one knew what it was, and I really don't believe they ever even looked into it. I asked them to leave us a message letting us know what they found out, I was curious to know what it was that I was sitting in for a minute and I never heard about it again.\nOf course they offered to move us out of that room so they can fix it, but I actually had to ASK to be upgraded to a better suite. That should have been offered. No one at the front desk seemed apologetic, or even surprised, which was concerning. \nThey need to be a bit more thorough with their cleaning, there were body hairs in the bathroom when we were first checking into the new room.\nTwo stars for the upgraded suite with a big whirlpool tub that I definitely appreciated.",202,1
"The rooms here are pretty crappy. I would probably have given it 1 star if it weren't in such a central part of the LV strip, gotten the room for free and have actually stayed in the room for more than 5 hours in the first three days here. LOL! I didn't stick around in this Casino, that's for sure. There was only 2 elevators in operation out of 8 that they had going up to my room. LOL! I guess Harrah's is only really concentrating on the Rio and Caesar's Palace as far upkeep on their casinos.\n\nI had rooms here from Thursday until Sunday but was rarely here and only stayed in the room 2 nights at 2 hours each night. I did play some poker here for an hour or so though and did manage to win some money here. It was a small poker room and was pretty hideous looking as well. \n\nIf a cheap room with a good spot on the strip is what you are looking for then I guess Imperial is the place for you.",220,1

"Nice place but customer service is horrible,  disconnection between staff and guest service.  Called to find out how to get to sister hotel Palms place to meet friends and person on the phone said take elevator to 2nd floor, elevator doesnt have the option for 2nd floor, called back and was put on hold for too long.  finally went to front desk.\n\nAfter being out till 4am (typical night in Vegas), wanted to sleep in but was waken at 8:30 to hammering, sanding and drilling in the room next to us.  Seriously construction this early....\n\nIt was raining in the morning so the pool was closed, understandable.  But when we returned from walking the strip at 4pm not a cloud in the sky the pool was still closed.\nWhen we asked if it would be reopened they said no due to the bad weather, yet it was clear skys now.  When trying to explain that it was nice now and all we wanted was to sit in the jacuzzi, we were transferred to the SPA where we could pay $15 ea to use their jacuzzi but guys and girls are separated so I can't sit in it with my husband.  No thanks, I would rather use the jacuzzi that my hotel should provide.",267,1
"Maybe I just don't get the W. That's possible. But I've stayed in W's in Chicago, Boston and Dallas, and I felt like those were all better than this one. \n\nProblems - the outside of this hotel and the inside are just opposites. Why doesn't the inside of this W reflect where it is located at all? I stayed in a king room, which was literally a perfectly square, 250 sqft studio apartment. I live in New York. I understand studio apartments. When you go to a place that has square footage to spare, you expect the hotel to reflect that. Also, this place is in the middle of sunny, tan Arizona, but the interior is dark as night all day long!! If they didn't bring out those mats that say what time of day it is, I have no idea how you would know the difference from inside. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is that the W is a sleek, trendy, big city feeling hotel, and that just doesn't fit in in Scottsdale, even if it is \""downtown\"" Scottsdale. Also, my room looks out onto construction and the window corner of someone else's room. Not sleek, not sexy.",260,1
"The best of both worlds.  Steak and prime rib.  Their rib eye is YUM.  Their prime rib is YUM(a little fatty, but you can just cut it off).  Their Twice baked potato is YUM.  Pretty much everything is YUM.   I call it Ruths' Chris and House of Prime Rib in one place.  They have that Prime Rib cart that they push around just like House of Prime Rib.  Service is excellent.  I highly recommend.  I just wish they had one in the bay area!",115,4
"This is a location specific review.\n\nI've attempted to come to this location a couple occasions.  I live closer to the Biltmore location and love it.  The atmosphere and food is great.  So, I was happy that there is a location near my in laws (it's always exciting to be able to eat healthy and enjoy their company).  We went for father's day, it wasn't all that impressive and the service was pretty lackluster, but my meal was good.\n\nI went again with my MIL a few weeks ago for a late lunch.  The place was swarming and our electronic notifier never went off.  We waited for about half an hour before I went in and asked if we were ever going to be seated.  And then I got attitude.  And the service was SO SLOW.  It wasn't particularly happy, friendly, or polite.  There is a vibe at this location and I don't like it.\n\nI'll keep my Biltmore location thank you very much.  And will not be going back to this TFK again.  It's a waste of time and money.",248,1
"First, the parking lot stinks.  There are about 8 spots, and it's not easy to navigate in a full size truck.  \nSecond, we walked in and all the tables were filthy, but empty.  The place was dead. \nWe stood at the counter for 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by the teenage worker.  I saw 4 other people in the back.  There was no greeting, no Welcome to Krispy Kreme.  \nWe came on a free doughnut day, but there was no signage anywhere, so I asked the guy if they were participating.  He just said yeah.  \nSo we got the doughnuts and checked out.  The guy didn't say anything, didn't thank us, nothing.  \nWe sat and ate our doughnuts.  My kids wanted a cup of water, and they stood at the counter for several minutes and were not acknowledged.  So I went up and asked the same guy for 2 cups of water.  He looked around like he was lost or didn't know how.  Another guy came over and took over, but then the cups just sat on the counter.  So I asked if we were able to get them or not.  2 of the workers said something along the lines of \""uh yeah in a minute\"".  So I said forget it and we walked out.  \nThey were totally indifferent to us being there.  None of the workers looked me in the face, or said hello or acknowledged that I was a customer in their store.  Totally inattentive, didn't seem to care that they had customers in the store.  We had planned on buying a few dozen donuts to take home, but after this, nope, we weren't going to spend any money there.  \nAnd we won't be back.  \nWorst experience.\nI'll drive 30 extra minutes to go to the Superstition location, where they are much better.",420,0

"I went there yesterday as I drove around time looking for a bakery because i was craving a cupcake. To my delight I found them on my map on Yelp and i drove there. \n\nGREAT FOR GLUTEN-FREE FOLKS! Not so good for me who likes fluffiness and flavor. \n\nThey are located in the Target shopping center closer to Green Valley Pkwy. The business is clean and a cute modern place to hang out. There are some tables and chairs to sit and visit. \n\nBut beware! They cater to gluten-free folks. Nothing wrong with that, I'm glad the gluten-free folks have a place to go BUT the rest of the population wont enjoy the dry texture gluten-free baked items have. Their prices range from $1.95-$4.00 for a bakery good. A little pricey for my wallet but that's just me. I'm sure the gluten-free crowd will eat it all up and willing to pay for the price of making sure they can enjoy something that wont harm their health. \n\nThis bakery also has a deli and various items one can enjoy for lunch. I didn't have lunch, So this review is only based on this experience.\n\n I just bought a whoopie pie which I almost bought 2 of. I'm sooo glad I only bought one. It wasn't our typical whoopie pie.. you know, soft, moist, tender to the squeeze of your hand and stuffed between the 2 cookies and soft, whippy cream one can imagine marrying if one could. Well not this whoopie pie. It was dry (prob b/c its gluten free) and hard. Cold and hard. The cream inside was tasteless, nothing to muse over. \n\nI was disappointed then again my whoopie pie level of perfection is pretty high since I've had many amazing ones in the past. Maybe they can work on the recipe??? It needs to be fluffly, creamy and flavorful guys! \n\nThey must have been busy earlier in the day bc there wasn't must left in the bakery display left for sale. They didn't have any cupcakes either so that's why I grabbed a whoopie pie and a root beer for under $8.. Yes $8 for a snack. Ughh.. hurt my wallet but what the heck, adventure and trying new things always have a price. \n\nIf you check in with Yelp you get a free iced coffee with any purchase..thats awesome but I don't drink coffee.. Maybe they can offer/make a free mini cookie instead?? More of us eat cookies rather than coffee. \n\nBottom Line: This is a place for the Gluten-Free crowd.",573,1
"Let me first say that I like Blu Burger.  I have been to another several times and really liked it.\nThis one, however, has no vibe.  I have never seen it full, in fact, I'm not sure I've ever seen it half full, which seems to be telling me something.  \nI do enjoy the food and think they have a good beer selection, (love the Sex Panther), but again, this place feels cold and unaccommodating.  When it first opened we came here at least twice a month, now we go once every other month.  I do hope something changes.",132,2

"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing (spicy linguini w/ shrimp), but my friends had never tried the Oyster Bar at Palace Station's Pan Roast, so we tried it here.  It is not even CLOSE.  I had a feeling it wouldn't be up to par with the original.  It had a lot of seafood, but the consistency was very watery and a bit too sweet.  I got the calamari, which had way too much breading on it and was on the salty side.  My other friend got the linguini w/ clams, which was not a very large portion considering the near $20 price (more or less).  There's no wait but skip the Pan Roast here!",149,1
"One disclaimer - I am someone who craves excitement and this was almost certainly a bad place for me to go.\n\nBut to me, this seemed insanely priced for a kinda boring and cold walk. You and a bunch of other people basically walk along the paths of the garden, which are lined with luminary candles. There are a couple trees covered in lights. Every so often there are food and drink stations and bands playing genres of music I don't enjoy  - blues, folk, Native American flute, etc. I guess the garden itself has some sweet plants and is  kinda nice and I could see how people who are just looking for a relaxing stroll might really enjoy going to this, but that's not me.\n\nOn the other hand parking was easily accessible and plentiful!",164,0
"The Pasty's here are pretty much gourmet hot pockets. I had the salmon pasty with a side of spicy beans.\n\nPros:\n-Great flavors with the salmon filling. Salmon was also cooked perfectly.\n-The dough was flaky and tender\n-The dill cream sauce that comes with the pasty is also great.\n-Car bombs are always good for brunch.\n\nCons:\n-Wasn't too into the spicy beans. They were too spicy for my liking, making it unbearable to eat.",112,3
"Writing a review on a hotel like the MGM Grand is so difficult cause there are so many components - the front desk, casino, rooms, etc. \n\nParking: Beware the walk is forever from the garage to the lobby. Once you get to the lobby you are almost a little dumbfounded by the size of the lobby, hotel, and casino.\n\nRooms: If only the rooms were as \""grand\"" as the hotel. (lol) Even though they just went through a \""grand renovation\"" I still wasn't all that impressed, everything is still pretty standard and just not as dated.\n\nThere are so many hotels on Las Vegas Blvd I really have no idea if I would stay here again cause there are so many other places I'd like to try out!",163,2
What happened to this place?\nMy husband I just went to lunch and it took forever to get our food. There were only a few people in there and we couldn't even get our beer within 10min.\nThe brisket is still fantastic but we won't be back due to TERRIBLE service.,66,0

"Beautiful store with lots of inventory but extremely snobby sales assistants and very rude managers. I came in here with a friend to return sunglasses that my friend no longer wanted and it took almost 30 mins just to get someone to help us, which is ridiculous because we were the only ones there besides one couple. It seems that the sales assistants would rather stare at the walls than help us. When we finally got helped the sales girl told us since we're returning an item the manager had to do it, so we waited another 20+ mins just for him.  When he finally arrived, he asked us if we opened the box and tried on the sunglasses, we told him no. He then opens the box containing the sunglasses and touches the sunglass lends with his bear fingers to pick up the sunglasses to hold it up to the light and accuses us of trying it on because there was a finger smudge on it! Well duh, there's a finger smudge, because you touched the lends, Dumb A**!!!  My friend and I were so furious that he would accuse us just so that he doesn't have to give us our money back. We spent 20 mins cleaning the sunglasses of the smudge but he kept saying that \""There was still a smudge on the lends\"" he even started yelling and lecturing us. The couple that was there obviously over heard him yelling at us and tried to calm the manager down and convince him to give our money back. The manager then started arguing with the couple and actually started calling them names and saying how worthless they are. \n\n\nOMG how rude can you be?! First of all you only work in retail, even if it's Louis Vuitton, it's still retail and it's not like you own the store you're just the manager. Your life isn't worth more than anyone else's. Second you NEVER argue with the customers. The customers are always right, but obviously he didn't get that.\n\nGlad to say that we got our money back but I'm sure as hell not going back to that store. I suggest that no one shops here, there are a lot of LV stores on the strip with better customer service and if you do plan on still going, I wish you good luck.",475,0

I gave it two stars primarily because of the poor customer service.\n\nThe positives are: \n1) huge gym with top notch equipment.\n2) pool and sauna\n3) personal trainers seem excellent\n4) movie cardio room\n5) fairly priced\n\nThe bad is:\n1). Lack of basic amenities (eg, no towels, no locks, even for purchase)\n2). Unresponsive / inflexible staff (eg the minimum number of personal training sessions that you can purchase is 17,  I tried to call to change a misscheduled appointment and after three calls I still didn't get through to a trainer to fix the time.).",156,1
"Terrible service. Wings were just okay.\nWARNING watch out for the bartenders writing in/changing tips on your receipts....Didn't notice on my account until a week later, but the bartender took it upon herself to write in a $3 tip on my receipt. I keep my receipts and usually leave a $ in the tip spot(meaning I left cash as tip)  but I can't believe some bartender was so damn greedy she needed to write in a 3 tip on my receipt which easily changed the total from 11 to 14.

"Jasmine is an elegant Chinese restaurant situated at the best possible location inside the Bellagio with a good view of hotel's massive fountain.  The d\u00e9cor is more French than Chinese.  The overall atmosphere suited my aristocratic taste.  This is perhaps one of the most posh looking Chinese restaurants in the world.  I, Dick Darlington dinned here twice for dinner.  Both times I enjoyed myself.  They even have \""monkey picked\"" tea on their menu.  These tea leafs were picked by trained monkeys and they are expensive and always only found at the most expensive Chinese restaurants and tea shops.  Of course I ordered some.  Their Peking duck is the highlight of their menu.  It is hard to believe that right in the middle of Las Vegas you can enjoy good quality Peking duck. \n \nSome might argue that their food is overpriced.  However, it is not just the food here that you are going for but also the sophisticated atmosphere and elegant services.  For that I think that it is worth the price.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nDick Darlington",229,4
Decided to try this place when a friend recommended it as great. We were dining rather late so there wasn't a whole lot of people there. Our waitress was excellent in directing us with our pizza choices. I ordered half mushroom and half meat lovers. I had noticed the mushroom half had no tomato sauce added. I thought that was strange. The meat portion was very good but the mushroom half was tasteless and really need some more mushrooms. I think there were at least 10 count on the whole four slices. When we got the bill I thought the price was high for a medium half and half pizza. A little over $9 for each half. The brew beer was really good. Probably will not be going back.,147,2
"I do my ratings and reviews based off of Customer Service, Quality, Taste, and portion size of the food and drinks, and the cleanliness and style of the restaurant.....\n\nThis is by far a new favorite place for me and my husband..... Me, my mother, husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw \""Brave\"" Great Movie) \n\nAnyhow, lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean, the setting was very romantic, it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families....  We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late  Monday nite  it wasn't too busy so, our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy.... \n\nThe waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers, salads, pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don't drink so unfortunately I can't give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they're Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing, very tasty, the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet, it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But, our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip) \n\nSo on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone's dish)The food was Hot, freshly made, and very flavorful....  My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment....  The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette, red wine, mustardy, type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn't instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color..... \n\nNow my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and  tasty......  The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal....\n\nLast but not least, I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green, fresh, crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about..... \n\nOverall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing.....",758,4
"I fly US Airways more frequently than other airlines due to their destinations and schedules. I've never had a safety concern and more times than not... the staff has been just fine. It concerns me about the possible US Airways take over of American with regards to first class service. I get to fly first class 6 to 10 times a year and by far... US Airways is the absolute worst. The fact they call it first class is a complete joke. They should call it \""the seat and a half with free vending food class\"".

"Service was excruciatingly slow. It took three times longer because the waitress said the \""grilled\"" chicken started frozen. Then they overcooked it and it was super dry. \n\nThe manager never came to check on us or apologize for the super slow service.\n\nKids menu says \""drinks included\"", but I was charged for the kids drinks. The waitress said its because the kids menu is for 10 and younger, but why didn't the menu or the waitress explain this detail when we ordered the kids drinks.

"I live in the neighborhood and have been very excited about going to this place. But it always seems closed. So finally, when today, my husband said there was a wine tasting I was very excited. \n\nWe live just down the street really so we walked. We walked in and asked about the wine tasting, which was advertised on the Coronado neighborhood listserv, and received a blind stare from the woman behind the counter. We asked her about it again and she said she would go find out. She went over a large man, who I presume is the owner. He explained to us how the plates work and when we did not jump up for joy over the idea of point out what we wanted to eat he started asking questions. It went like this:\nMan: You're just scared. You've never had this kind of food.\nMe: No that is not true. (mind you we are looking at a display of meats, potatoes, asparagus, farfalle pasta salad, some Greek salad and some other pretty normal Mediterranean foods.)\nMan (getting a little pushy): This is Mediterranean food. You've never had it right?\nMe: I've had Greek, Turkish and Italian food\nMan: Well this is a Greek, Italian and French mix. You are from Phoenix, aren't you?\nMe: No, actually I was born in Poland.\nMan: Yeah, but you've only lived here in Phoenix.\nMe: No, I've lived in Washington, DC and  Portland, OR.\nMan: Well, all the Polish people who have tried my food loved it. \n\nAt this point I am annoyed. Really annoyed. This is pretty much like saying: All the Americans that have tried McDonald's love it. Plus, how many Polish people are there really in Phoenix. And has he insulted them as well??? No offense to anyone who had not traveled or lived outside of Phoenix, but who gives this man the right to judge me about anything. I have traveled and have tried other foods. Lets assume for a minute that I have not had these experiences, well I would probably not want to try Mediterranean food at La Piccola Cucina  All I wanted was to eat at his restaurant. Instead, my husband and I pretended to look at the gelato ( and yes, I do know that is Italian ice cream) and when the man went into the kitchen we left.\n\nWe walked about a block North to Lisa G's Wine Bar, which if you have not tried you really should. This place is always friendly, the food is fantastic and when they have wine tasting or specials they are aware of them.",556,0

"The first thing you notice when you visit this no-kill sanctuary is how clean, peaceful and well organized it is. Every bunny is well cared-for and has a goodly amount of space for their pen thanks to efficient placement and organization. The staff and volunteers make it a point to know each bunny e.g. personalities, likes/dislikes, etc. to the point where they attach a diagram of bunny's pen layout (they like their dish over here, their hiding place over there, etc.) to the front of their pen so that volunteers know where everything goes when they clean the bunny's space. And every bunny gets groomed, petted, fed, watered, loved and properly tended. The staff and volunteers are dedicated to finding each bunny a happy and safe \""forever home\"", and don't just give bunnies to anyone who asks. They make sure that you really want the bunny and will be able to take care of it as it deserves. Tranquility Trail Animal Sanctuary can and should serve as a model for all other animal rescues, as they truly love these creatures and are well-schooled in how to care for them and take time to answer any questions new bunny owners have. These bunnies are not just a bunch of homeless critters - They are all members of their bunny family. If you are looking for a bunny, please adopt one instead of buying one, and please give one of the many adorable bunnies from this sanctuary a chance to be a part of your family. Tranquility Trail also has a handy store on the premises that is well stocked with quality items you need for your bunny at prices significantly less than pet stores. And every penny goes directly back to the sanctuary bunnies I aopted my bunny from them and will do so again in the future. In Yelp-ese, 5 stars means \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"", and it really, truly is.",388,4
I used to stay here in the past but not anymore. They cut way back on a lot of things like quality of service for drinks and cocktails.

"Like most recent comments, mine is one of sorrow.  This used to be one my favorite places for Chinese, they had the best fresh hand pulled noodles. \n\nAnyway, I made a call for pick up the other day and was confused when the girl on the line kept telling me that they didn't have my beloved schezuan eggpant noodles, or my pork wontons in red chile sauce....I thought maybe they had run out?  I end up ordering some egg fu yung and beef & broccoli noodles (I've had both before from here.  Delicious.) \n\nI pull up to the restaurant and walk up to the door, to find a new paper menu taped to the door!  I was beyond shocked because the restaurant bares the same name, signage and made no mention as to their new ownership when I was trying to order my \""the usual\"".   \n\nI walk in to an empty restaurant and ask the girl about the ownership.   She told me they have new owners and a new menu.  I leave feeling pretty bummed, but willing to give it a try, because I can't walk out and I'm hungry.  \n\nI drive home (15-20) and pull out my dishes....gross.  The egg fu yung's brown sauce was filled, literally to the brim of the styrofoam packaging.  The gravy was broken and had about an inch of oil on the top of it.  I took out a patty and took a bite, LAVA hot.  The noodles for the beef and broccoli weren't fresh at all and adding a traditional beef and broccoli (from PANDA EXPRESS) over some boxed noodles, was not what I am looking for at all.

"Disclaimer straight up: Wildflower sent me a gift card, which I used for this lunch. That creates some bias, but it also made me hyper-critical through the whole experience, as I did want to write a balanced review. \n\nIt's the holiday season and the shopping center around Wildflower Bread was bustling. I wasn't surprised to find the restaurant's seating mostly full--which was fine, as I was doing take-out. I had two people ahead of me in line but only had to stand there for maybe a minute.

I stood back by the drink dispenser, as there was no seating, and to my shock I waited all of two minutes before I was called for my salad. Considering the busy-ness, that was really something.\n\nI arrived home, famished. I rarely get take-out, in part because something is usually left out. I was happy to open my paper bag and find everything there. The two chunks of Vienna bread were just what artisan bread should be: a crust with tender toughness, with a chewy, perfect interior. \n\nThe chicken pistachio salad itself had an odd mix that worked in a surprising way. I never would have paired kalamata olives with oranges, but it ends up with a sweet/sour dynamic. The onions were a little strong, but everything else was just right in flavor and texture: feta, mixed cabbage, chopped pistachios, very fresh and flavorful chicken, and a dressing that was of good sweetness.\n\nI tried only a small piece of the bear claw--the rest was for my husband, who greatly enjoyed it with his coffee. This was one huge pastry! It's a meal unto itself.\n\nThis visit to Wildflower Bread Company reminds me that I should visit much more often. I can't really find anything bad to say about it, even when I try.",414,4
"Pretty much the Pittsburgh interpretation of Tex-Mex. This pretty much entails terrible salsa, blue margarita salt. Not nearly as loud as the Oakland one, and a better bar. They had mole burritos so that was good. \n\nIf you want Tex-Mex, go elsewhere. If you want to drink here with friends, well that's ok I guess. This and Steel Cactus are pretty much the same thing.",88,1
"We ordered food from here last night and it was just ok.  All the meats seemed to be over cooked and dried out.  \n\nThe falafel was hard and dry, the Gyro meat was just ok, over cooked, I don't know if it was just because it was evening or what, but the food was not impressive enough to make us want to go back.  The prices are very reasonable, but the cheap price kind of matches the over over cooked food.\n\nThe portions of food are large on the rice and pita bread, but very skimpy on dishes with fries and ok on meats, if it only tasted better.\n\nAt some point we may give this place another try but it is not a place we will rush back too.",161,2
3.75 for a GROCERY STORE tasting cupcake. I want uniqueness and originality in my cupcakes and how its unique to that bakery. I was unsatisfied. Was boring and kinda dry. 2 stars for the size but its not worth the horrible bland boring taste. Go to 21 cupcakes on Indian bend and scottsdale (across from the railroad park) instead for melt-in-your-mouth cupcakes to support a great local business. Sprinkles is too dry and overrated for me and I don't recommend it.,110,1

"Pregnant as a first time mom I found baby stores extremely overwhelming...especially the places with 500 different types of pacifiers on one wall.  The Milky Way is a nice break from the big box stores.  You'll find the owner at the register and very willing to help you sort through the merchandise, offering advice without pressuring you for a sale.  I even met her kids once--very sweet!\n\nIf you're planning to cloth diaper this is a great place to get your supplies.  You'll find your basic prefolds & cute covers, the more sophisticated brands, as well as other products that make cloth diapering more convenient.\n\nFor the majority of moms out there: Don't let me scare you with the cloth diaper comments if you're the queen of Pampers...this place is really fun! You'll find sweet and clever items that will be sure to get even more oohs and aahhhs from everyone who sees your little bundle of joy!",211,3
"We came here because we sat at the Irish place next door and was never offered water let alone menu. \nWe sat ourselves, waited about 5 min and a server took our drink order. After bringing those she took our order. \nWe had the nachos - probably the best item we ordered. Still not the best ever. \nMy husband ordered the Big Fish sandwich because of one of the pics on Yelp. Very misleading. Hardly big, and tasteless to boot. He said he was thankful for tartar sauce. \nBuffalo Wings- no buffalo sauce actually on them, but they had a slight spice to them. They were ok. Nothing special - wouldn't order them again. Served with fries. \nKids all ordered pizza - they ate them without complaint. \nChicken tacos - my sister said they were good. I think she got the best item. \nMy BIL ordered the fish &chips - again nothing special. I think they fry everything in the same oil. We had 2 root beers, and 3 reg beers - our bill was over $100. \nWouldn't recommend. Wouldn't return. Probably get the same good at a Dennys.",247,1
"Writing this review was tough. I want to like, even love this place but I just can't seem to get over the unpleasant experience we had. Lets get started. \n\nWe came here because some of our friends said the food here was great. I'm always excited when friends rave about a new place. Upon entering, I was quite impressed. The hostess was friendly and the atmosphere was open and very trendy. What a great start, or do I thought. \n\nWe found our group and sat down. As we were chatting, this lady shows up and stands by our table and doesn't say anything. When we finally greeted her, we found out she was our server. She didn't even say her name or hello, just a 'can I get you something to drink?' We ordered some drinks and they took a really long time to arrive, one by one. Not a very good sign.\n\nOrdered our food and hoped for the best. Here's what's on the menu:\n\nAPPETIZERS:\nCeviche: good, not great. The fish seems like they were already cooked before everything was tossed together. The overall dish lacked flavor. It was precooked fish, scallops etc. tossed with lemon and avocados. The avocados gave the dish some flavoring. Not my favorite and will not be having it here again. \n\nBang bang shrimps: This dish is great to those that love mayo. It was good, I don't know if I would give this dish 5 stars. It over dressed and reminds me of having walnut shrimp at a Chinese buffet. \n\nCaesar salad: Nothing too special here either. Both of your salads were overdressed and soggy. Not very appealing, especially when it seems like the dressing wasn't even made in house. \n\nENTREES:\n\nShrimps and scallop, mango salsa and green beans: To my surprise this dish was good. The scallops were cooked nicely and well seasoned. The shrimps were a bit undercooked so I didn't eat them. And my green beans were no longer green but brown, so I didn't eat those either. \n\nFish tacos: These were very good. Fresh and light. There's only two tacos so if you're hungry, order two orders. \n\nSalmon and asparagus: salmon was flaky and not over cooked. Asparagus on the other hand were soft to the touch and brown. \n\nSea bass: I didn't try this dish but it did get great reviews at the table. \n\nThe food here isn't bad, but it also not amazing. But then again, what are you expecting from a chain restaurant? What would have made our experience better was the service. Our server was not friendly, didn't seem to know the menu items and it was slow and completely unorganized. Everything about the service aspect of this restaurant is unorganized. \n\nThey have a concept call \""team work\"" here. This is when the team/staff needs to help each other by delivering food and clearing the table etc. this is a nice idea, except no one at this location seems to know how to do it. Drinks came one at a time. Coffee came one at a time. By the time we got our coffees, the rest of the table had already finished theirs and was waiting for us. Our table wasn't clear of all the empty appetizer plates before dinner got dropped. Our server failed to be a decent server. I'm sure if I went to Denny's, the server there would have done better job. Such a waste of a restaurant space. Bonefish has a lovely room and prime location but the staff is a joke. \n\nI would recommend this place to people under the circumstance that they just sit at the bar. Here's a tip that I live by, PEOPLE COME FOR THE FOOD BUT COME BACK FOR THE SERVICE. Get it together bonefish. Look at your entire staff and start picking out the weeds or you'll be packing your bags and leaving not just henderson, but Vegas, for good. \n\nHappy eating everyone, ciao :)",874,2

"The Peartree is THE student pub to go to. \n\nSituated just around the corner from the main University campus George Square, The Peartree is without a doubt the place to go for a cheeky wee drink with friends. \n\nI will always associate this pub with the end of exams as this is where we would all go after out last exam to celebrate with a drink. I have occasionally come here with friends for a drink between classes. The Peartree is also highly popular with the locals too which I think is always a good sign. The inside decor of the Peartree isn't up to much, and if it wasn't for the outside garden, I doubt it would be so popular with all the students. There is always a very chilled out and relaxed atmosphere here and it is a great place to come on a warm day and sit in the beer garden outside to chillax. \n\nI sometimes find the drinks quite expensive here compared to some of the other pubs and bars in the area, but they have a huge variety of ales and ciders available which makes up for it. Food is also served here, which consists of the traditional pub food such as fish and chips, baked potatoes and burgers which are all well priced at around \u00a36. \n\nThe Peartree House is an incredibly popular place to hang out during the Edinburgh Festival, especially on a sunny day, and the outside garden is always packed and be difficult to find a seat.",314,2
"This is better then average Chinese food prepared for an American palate. Most everything is good. But, it's all a bit too salty. So I get everything with the sauces on the side. We usually order the Ahi Tuna Wasabi salad. If you want to stay in the suburbs and same some decent Chinese, this is a good option.",71,2
"Received two complimentary tickets through a Southwest promotion. I'm so glad I chose Ka as the many choices we had to choose from! I would describe it as creative, action packed, and mind boggling. It is amazing what they can do with a floating stage. Seriously, this was my first show I've seen in Vegas and Ka set a high standard. The show consisted of flying aparatuses, martial arts, amazing baton throwing skills, unbelievabl acrobatics, and this stage that was used in every way possible. Just amazing creativity! We were definitely entertained the entire one and half hours! The performers are super talented and brave. My bf was very impressed as well, definitely an either sex satisfaction. The Ka theatre at MGM Grand is spectacular as well...right when you walk in you're in awe. I would watch it again and pay a normal ticket price, whatever it is. My favorite part was the drowning scene, it looked so real.",196,4
Kinda expensive but it helps to know someone. ... We were in the 12th row on the side but it was still good seats... You could definitely sit a little back for this show. The moving stage was amazing and there is one sequence in which ~SPOILER ALERT~ the sticks came out of it and the performers were weaving through it at a 90 degree angle.wow. ~END~\n\nIt was fun to watch the performers and I was very involved in the storyline. My fiance wasn't as impressed but he had fun as well. The set is beautiful and you notice this once you walk in. The length of the show is perfect. Maybe they could do one more act but it's cool.,150,3
"Lunch date with my husband on President's day (bank closed and make-up school day for our son). We are always looking to try out new restaurants whenever we can. I had the chicken with risotto and my husband had the fried calamari on salad. Salad ingredients sounded great...arugula, napa. Just a bit heavy on the dressing and also too spicy for me but if you like it spicy then it would be fine. My chicken was tender and juicy. I like the whole shitake mushrooms in the risotto and fresh leafy spinach was nice too. Risotto was cooked perfectly. Only thing I prefer not to have is the creme sauce covering the chicken. That is just my preference to rather see the perfectly cooked chicken on top of the risotto. We both ordered the onion soup. A bit salty for my liking. Other than that, nice amount of onions, not overly cheesy but would not order it again. I had no room in my stomach to finish my entree. Had to bring more than half of it home. But I had room to try a dessert. We Yelped for directions to Dressler's on my husband's mobile phone and was pleasantly surprised to see a free dessert on Yelp app. We had the apple cake. It was yummy! It was plated with caramel and vanilla ice cream. Our son would love the apple cake and we would definitely go back to Dressler's. I only give 5 stars if everything about the place is perfect. If there is 4 and 1/2 star I would give it. Took off a star for plating of the entrees (too much sauce & dressing) and too salty onion soup. There are many restaurants we tried and would not go back to. Dressler's is not one of those. I look forward to a scheduled late date with a colleague next week at Dressler's.",382,3
Surprisingly the food was excellent Long with the perfect margarita. Strong and the sandwiches were so big and filling we had a late dinner. Would recommend.,30,4
"I enjoyed my stay here at the MGM.  Check in was easy and prompt.  Most of the staff are very friendly and smile and say hello to you in the halls.  The rooms are very nice, clean, and modern, oh wait except for the 2 bloody booger smears that it looked as though someone had been jumping on the bed and smeared on the ceiling, like my brother used to do at home. Gross! I made sure not look at the ceiling or else I would start gagging.  I love the blackout shades.  I also really liked Michael Minas Pub.  I planned on doing all my day drinking there and having lunch there again, but unfortunately they dont open till 5pm on weekdays.  I tried the Tap Room, and their food was really good, but unfortunately they didnt offer much on tap. They probably had between 10-15 beers and I wish there was more than just the 3 standard ipa's that everybody else had as well.  Damn it Michael Minas why cant you open earlier!!!  I ended up taking my day drinking business to another hotel that had a pub with a large draught list and good variety as well as happpy hour.  Love the pool area. Even though it was very busy we never had trouble finding seats. I like that there are different pools to choose from.  A bucket of 5 beers is $35.00, not bad!  When we checked in I asked if we could have a late check out and was told I couldnt set that up in advance and I would have to call the morning of check out, the earlier the better.  So morning of check out I call the front desk at 5am and was told late check out was not available, but I could book another night or still have to check out at 11am.  Not sure why late check out was not offered when I booked online.  After I had already booked my room, I had went to the MGM Grand website probably a week later and noticed they were offering a late check out option for $20.00, also for the same dates I was staying, and also with one of their summer promotions.  I wish I had this option when I booked online.  You would think after staying here for 5 nights they would have been nice enough to let me have a late check out.",490,2
Haunted house themed pub above a haunted house.  While the haunted house is open only a few months a year this place will hopefully be opened year round.  Get the Bat Wings.  They have some busy burgers - perhaps too many good things mixed together make it less than great.  I hope they focus on the kitchen - they can own the nearby university if they had smoked wings instead of fried - no one has that around here.,89,3
"Gotta say it's one of the better chain restaurants around in the valley!\n\nAmerican-Italian pizzas and pastas sounds pretty simple, but Oregano's is one of those places that's a must try.  With several locations from Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, and even Tucson; you really don't have much reason not to go!  \n\nThis time around I ordered the Clark St. Meat pizza along with trying out my friends anti-pasto salad.  Again, simple, but tasty.  The salami, peppercini pepper, and parmesan cheese on the salad was very light and not over powering with dressing like most places.  The pizza I ordered thin crust and yes the crust was perfectly toasted and not soggy as I would expect with all the meat ingredients atop.  Tad bit of spice and no need to add more peppers to heat it up - yum!  \n\nOverall, food was great and service is very good.  Well trained staff members, courtesy and attentive - A plus in my book! Enjoy!",217,4
"Big Fish has cleaned up its act, just a bit. I went there last night with a few friends after not having been in at least a year and it looks... nicer somehow. Yes it's a little divey, but divey with a smile. It's actually pretty clean and maintained inside. I think the term \""neighborhoody\"" would be more appropriate.\n\nWe sat at the bar and were taken care of right away. I struck up a conversation with the bartender about how we wanted Agwa mojitos, and he only responded with a quizzical look. \""Uh... We don't make ANY mojitos here.\"" \n\nOh really? Hmm. You see, Big Fish was voted \""Best Place to Drink Agwa\"" by the New Times, and the article mentioned something about a wonderful glorious Agwa mojito that the bar makes. So, we wanted 'em. But to no avail. Notice: They don't make mojitos at Big Fish. EVER. The New Times lied. They do however, make \""Liquid Speedballs\"" which is Agwa, Sprite and Red Bull. So if you ever need to give yourself a heart attack AND get drunk at the same time, this is your shit. \n\nLater in the night some drunk dude spilled me and my friend's beers all over the bartop, and before we could even say anything the bartender had us covered with ice cold new ones. Very nice! \n\nThere is also a small stage, but tuesday night is Rock Band Night (the video game) so people were playing that. Fun! We ended up joining in with some of the other people playing. They have a little sign up sheet so you can play with your group whenever you're up. No drama, just hangin' out. See, neighborhoody!",383,3

"I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \""this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\"".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.",462,1
"A terrific museum and free! Ideally suited for folks like me that don't want to do a whole day, just want to go in for a couple of hours, see a couple interesting things and go back for more on another day. \n\nI went to the Modern and Contemporary galleries.  They were not large but had a terrific array of international and Canadian artists.  Modern was impressive! Was not expecting such extensive holdings of Picasso, Rodin, etc. My favourite, though, was the Contemporary.  I have had fairly recent visits to the MOMA, and to the Pop exhibits and the National Art Gallery and the Art Gallery of Ontario.  But the Musee's exhibit was just plain fun! Interesting, amusing, and thought provoking pieces arranged to accommodate strolling grown-ups and hollering day-camp groups equally well.",172,4

I don't even know if I have the words to explain how this place is . Let me start by saying I refer everyone I know to Skin Design . My husband and I have been going to Robert for a few years . Everyone is always professional and they make you feel like family . No matter how simple or intricate your piece is they make sure it turns out perfect . I constantly get asked who did my tattoo . A tattoo is a work of art on your body that will most probably be there forever . You wouldnt go to the 99 cent store for a wedding dress . So you pay for quality . (Clearly that's towards people that complain about prices ) Anthony is like a free live comedy show . And the shop is always clean . Kelly is always helpful and all the other artists are friendly . I wear my art with pride when I tell people who created it . Much Love to Skin Design .,184,4
"Wow, I'm really glad I was able to avoid this place for so long. I finally got sucked in and went for dinner with a co-worker. I thought it was bad stuff.

They have a book with seasonally decorated bunt cakes to order. There are so many flavors to choose and seasonal ones too. The flavors ranged from red velvet to marble. At the bottom of the review I listed the flavors and pricing. There are 4 sizes of bundt cakes: bundtinis, bundtlets, 8' and 10'. I got the smallest, the bundtinis to sample the different flavors. The ladies were nice, except one lady got upset at me or taking photos. Se told the manager who came out and asked me a bunch if questions like I was stealing a business secret. I like taking pictures and I was excited to try their product. I was quite taken aback and would have been fine with a simple no pictures please. After waiting 20 minute for my dozen, they brought me out the wrong size which I should have just taken. so I had to wait another 20 minutes. All in all. The cakes were yummy and I wanted more!

"This the first time I have taken the time to write a review (I ordinarily have better things to do),  and as you might expect it is motivated by unusually bad experience.  I ate there today for lunch (a Sunday afternoon)  with my wife and some friends.  We have all eaten at Italian Pie several times before and had a good opinion of the place (other than occasional slow service) until today (and had you asked me to review it prior today, i would have given it 3.5 stars).   We came in for lunch when there were maybe three or four other tables occupied.  The waitress was relatively new, which I am making allowances for in this review.   Mu friend and I came for some Four Friends (local brew) on tap, which Italian Pie has carried in the past (I77 IPA -- awesome),  but apparently no more (this may have been a limited production by Four Friends though, I am not sure).  Back to he ordinary stuff you can find anywhere (they do still have Old Meck Copper on tap if you want a local brew).   We settled for the Sam Adams winter lager (good beer, but again you can get that anywhere).  We were disappointed, but more disappointed that it took no less than 20 minutes to get our drinks (including our kids drinks).  The waitress recommended the bloody mary which our wives tried.  They were not impressed.  Only after telling the waitress we were going to leave, did our drinks finally come out.  Again, let me emphasize the place was far from busy, but apparently the bartender was overwhelmed.  \n\nThen the wait for the food  . .  and it was not worth the wait, nor the price.  My wife ordered a calzone, my friend the pastrami sandwich.  I ordered a cup of soup with a chicken caesar salad.  The sandwiches (my friend previously had eaten here several times and usually ordered the pastrami sandwich and loved it) looked different than before - like something from Gordon Ramsey;s Kitchen Nightmares.   My grilled chicken ceasar salad (the chicken looked liked prepackaged sliced chicken (Oscar Meyer maybe??) caesar with the chicken on top - but wrapped in a big ball of aluminum foil.  The food that came out was the most unappetizing in appearance/presentation I have seen in a long time.  Maybe presentation isn't everything, but when you charge $9.50 for a salad, maybe you should leave the ball of aluminum foil off of it.  Just a suggestion.  The difference in presentation/taste/quality was so noticeably different, we asked the waitress who told us the prior kitchen  manager had quit the week before.    \n\nAnyway, we were not shy about conveying some constructive criticism to our waitress (which is VERY unusual for us), we got not so much as a visit to our table from the manager. instead we we got a bill for the full amount.\n\nNeedless to say, neither my wife and I nor our friends will be going back.  What a huge disappointment and waste of time and money.  Unless some big changes are made, you would be better off going just about anywhere else in town.",667,0

"My wife and I have frequented this familiar place for years and loved Ginny's excellent service and personality. She has, as several other posts have indicated, sold the restaurant to new owners and sadly they have changed and not for the better. \n\nThe menu was different. The plating of the food was poorly done. The portions have been scaled back and the prices have been scaled forward. \n\nWe just got back from our LAST VISIT to this place and I was horrified with the poor quality of the food, the service, and we were the only ones in the entire place for quite a while. \n\nIn retrospect, I'm not surprised since everyone that frequented Zorba's apparently already knows what we were terribly disappointed to find out. \n\nI hate to have to write a poor review for a restaurant that we have loved for years.

(cranberry juice, lemonade(?), and more red bull than a liquor store can handle).  our party went to town on the offering...but being a beer chick, i ordered my guinness and happily downed my stout.  the dj kicked out the jams...the people were really decent...laidback...into their own thing.  except for the loser guy who kept trying the take advantage of our on the verge of passing out friend (wanker!)  other than that, i liked the place, the music, the vibe, and the people...i'd definitely recommend it to my fellow-yelpers!",193,3

"I haven't been to Vegas since March, so it's been a while since eating here, but for some reason - I have no idea why - I was just thinking about the calzone that I get at Wolfgang Puck's every time I go there.  It's probably the best calzone that I've ever had and I've eaten my fair share of calzones.  Perfect crust - not too flaky, not too thick.  Lots of delicious cheese  and plenty of chicken and whatnot.  \n\nThe first time we ate here we were both hot and tired and cranky and hungry and had wandered around New York New York and the MGM Grand and no food option sounded good.  Finally we decided to try Wolfgang Pucks and we were pleasantly surprised by the outstanding calzone and, of course, the Maytag bleu cheese potato chips.  It instantly made us feel better and we were able to continue on. \n\nI'm a little bummed, I'm hungry for a calzone.  But I won't be back in Vegas for quite some time and it doesn't look like any of the affordable Puck locations in Los Angeles serve them.  Hmmm....must think of an excuse.",258,3
"I found this salon through Yelp, what a gem!  Recently moved to Vegas from Toronto, I have been looking for a new place to get my hair done.  My hair is fine and a bit frizzy, I straighten it or put it in a ponytail but I never know what to ask for to make it look thicker.  Brianna was amazing!  She talked me into light layers and recommended some curls and the price was fantastic.  Highly Recommend her.",96,4
"Came here on a Monday at 7:30 pm and it was closed. It was supposed to be open until 9 pm. Yes, there is construction but it is unacceptable to close early without some notification. Just lost 2 customers...will NEVER come back.",56,0
"This is my first review ever and I couldn't be more compelled to write one to spare anybody who is thinking of trying this place. \n\nTwo girlfriends and I  tried this place this past Saturday and not only was it the WORST FOOD ever it was also the WORST SERVICE. We ordered a bottle of wine and the pretzel for an appetizer then after 20min we were told our pretzel was given to someone else and that was the last one so they would like to substitute it for free. Then we ordered our main courses. I ordered the Ribbon Pasta with shrimp on the side and my friends ordered the steak salad. When our food arrived my friend's were brought JUST steaks, but since my pasta arrived at the same time my friends said they would just suck it up and eat the steaks. One bit of my Ribbon Pasta and I wanted to vomit! I had my friend try it to confirm and she completely agreed. Since my friends didn't even want actual steaks we decided it would be best to send it all back. The waiter that came over (Mike) was so amazing. He said No problem and would bring me something else off the menu and my friends what they actually ordered. 5min later the food runner came over and told me that \""since nothing was actually wrong with your food we are going to have to charge you for both meals\"". I was in complete shock and immediately asked for the manager. 5min later she then comes back and told me \""the manager does not want to come out and fight with me out here\"" when I responded with \""nobody wants to fight I just want to address the issue so he needs to come out here and chat with me\""  2min later she comes out and says \""he will not come out and talk to you cause he does not want to fight\"". Proceeded to tell her I am going to make sure I write a review on yelp and he needs to chat with me now. \n\nAfter that the Manager/Owner came to our table and tried to tell me that he never told the food runner to say those things to me. LIAR! Why would she say it twice. After explaining to him the issues he did nothing to really solve them. He just said he wouldn't charge us for the pretzel we never got! Really?!? I then told him I am not paying for food that we didn't even eat! He then left and sent our original waiter over with our check... They charged us for the French Fries appetizer and the bottle of wine. We quickly reminded him we didn't even want the french fries and that they were comping them because they gave the pretzel we did order to someone else. \n\nSo my friends and I paid for our wine. Since we split the check three ways the total was $11.27 and we all left a $2 tip. So the total that should have been charged would be $13.27... guess what I looked at my bank statement today and they charged me $27.27!!!!! OMG I am going back there today and demanding they fix this error!!",650,0
"Holy cow. My wish was granted. I was a regular at the other office, and all I wanted was a more central location. Well, a few folks from the old office (Eric and Shanti) came over to start this new office. The new office is super comfy. They have a really nice couch in their waiting room, and ample parking.\n\nThe quality of the visits are on par with the other office (same massage therapist,) and I actually enjoy the doctor over here way more. Dr. Johnson is super gentle in his adjustments, but gets the job done.",119,4
"Razzy my Razzy!  Time for another end-of-summer review.  Yes I know I've been here a few times this summer, but it's been a hectic one and I've taken a little break from Yelping!\n\nAnyway, much like my review last year, the days and nights are cooling off a little bit and there's still a little time left to take a walk for some yummy treats with your significant other.  So how 'bout some original flavor topped with pineapple and white chocolate?  Yum!",115,3
"They REALLY need to turn on the AC in here! I wasn't even dancing, and it felt like I was in Satan's anus. Stuck around for about an hour, and got tired of waiting for a non-synchronized dance. Seriously, when do the normal people get their groove on without being trampled by the High School Musical cast? And why are the drinks so overpriced? This isn't the Strip.\n\nI give it two stars just because of the nifty decor and good music. Plus, free admission with a players club card. But if you aren't going to take the dance classes every week, there are definitely better clubs.",135,1
I attend a lot of concerts and I think I can safely say this is the last one I'm going to attend at The Marquee.  The acoustics are not wonderful but are acceptable.  \n\nMy main problem is that the slope of the floor from the stage to the back is small enough that I cannot see behind the throng of people watching the show through their phones (WHY!?!?!).  They used to do a VIP area which was a nice option but I haven't seen it for several shows.  \n\nDrinks are overpriced but that's to be expected.  I like the intimacy of it but don't really want to spend another concert trying to see around peoples' phones.,149,1
"The best - get the Chicago Mix!  \n\nWhat a treat to visit and happen apon this shop!  It is a little steep for popcorn but it is literally the best popcorn I've had in my life.  If you get a small bag, I guarantee you'll be back for more!",66,4
We're going to find a different nail place in the Ahwatukee area next time we need a mani/pedi. \n\nAlthough the staff was very nice I was rushed through both my pedicure and manicure despite there being no wait (but it was a full house). I was done with both the pedicure and manicure by the time my mom was done with her pedicure.\n\nMy feet were left rough and polish was sloppy. The polish for my manicure was bubbly and not cleaned from my cuticles. \n\nPricing is average compared to similar nail salons.,121,1
Nice service people but agents are rude and not upfront with you about the charges. Want use them again,21,1
Drai's in Hollywood is better. Would you believe that? I never thought that would ever come out of my mouth. That something in Los Angeles would be better then Vegas. But true. This club is too dark and low ceilings. Kinda boring.,53,1
"Went to Montreal for a weekend with friends, as I am sure many others did as well! Came here because a friend suggested it and it was the worst experience I have ever had at any establishment EVER.\n\nMandatory tipping, overpriced drinks, shoved out the door because we were there for too long. \n\nHORRIBLE WAITRESS. gave her an 8$ tip on a $40 tab (which was 4 beers) and she complained and TOOK $10 INSTEAD. SHE TOOK MONEY FROM US.\n\nSave yourself the time and don't stop in here. Spend your money elsewhere.",133,0
"I DONT GET IT. This a la carte culture in the food world is getting ridiculous. More money for less food. It would be one thing if the food was really good, but it's just okay. 10 dollars for a bowl of heirloom tomato wedges?? The server was nice enough and knowledgable, but that's about it. Don't waste your time. \n\nAlso the valet service in that strip mall is terrible. Complementary service? Sure why not! They insisted that I just have them park it so I obliged. Except They pulled up ten minutes after I gave them my ticket because they don't know what they're doing, and it's not that big of a lot. And they pulled up with my girlfriends car with the trunk open. Why? who knows. \n\nSo. 30 dollars for a hamburger, a tomato salad, and a bowl of coffee (just put it in a mug, for goodness sake), plus a 6 dollar tip is 20%, and then a tip for the incompetent valet if you're not a crappy person is over 40 dollars just for lunch. If you're a rich person who needs somewhere to spend your money, go to Little Spoon. If you're just a person who wants good food at a reasonable price (or even someone who doesn't mind paying more for ACTUALLY good food with decent portions), then go somewhere else. \n\nJust finished this review shortly after my meal and I'm already hungry, if that gives you an idea.",324,1
"They suck at working on Japanese cars as well, they FAILED miserably at making some basic repairs on an old '93 Honda Accord I had several years back, and after going back to them four times they STILL couldn't get it right.

Lunch to go from O'Charleys was absolutely wonderful. I work in the same plaza so I called in my order for pick up. I ordered the loaded baked potato and broccoli which was only about $6. I drove right over there and the food was hot and ready within five minutes. The food tasted great. Best loaded baked potato I ever had. Will definitely be catching lunch there more often.,82,3
"This is a neighborhood fruit and vegetable store, which also has a selection of other food items, including an extensive cheese and cured meat counter, Premier Moisson bread. To me Val-Mont is the best of many such fruit and vegetable stores along Mont-Royal Ave. There is another Val-Mont further west, which is a little better than this one.\n\nOne complaint: stick to the fruits and vegetables. Hamel cheese shop is right down the block, along with Maison de Roti butcher, and a brand new full service Metro supermarket. So why is Val-Mont trying to do everything?",124,2
"What can I say... I am a bargain shopper! I'm not cheap, but I get more satisfaction out of getting a bargain than I do spending a ton of money for a name brand item at Nordstrom or Sax Fifth. That being said, sure you can find a pair of shoes you'll like here, but the selection is simply OK, and its usually full retail price. Most of the time they have a two-for-one deal or get the second pair half price. Still, its never really any kind of sweet deal.",111,1
"Not a bad place, so the \""A-OK\"" rating is fitting.\nHuge room on the 25th floor, a double bedroom room, with a large living area in the middle.  \n\nMany different dining options downstairs, from prime rib to Steak n Shake.\n\nThe Seattle's Best coffee place gets very busy in the morning, be aware.\n\nThe bagels at the deli are AMAZING, highly recommend one of those babies for breakfast.\n\nHotel is about 10-15 minutes from the Strip, but the hotel has plenty of parking in the lots and in a large parking structure.",135,2
"Hole in the Wall?  I think Sh!t hole is more appropriate.  While the server was pleasant and professional, they served my daughter sour, curdled milk.  How does that happen?  The garlic bread was stale, the wine was horrible, neither of my girls could stomach their meatballs and the salad was limp.  It was like stepping back in time... and not a good time.",83,0
Good but not great.\nPretty wide magazine selection given its smallish size though.,18,2
"I've been to other Ling and Louie's and I was confused by the Biltmore L&L. The menu had vestiges of the former restaurants menu, fish tacos, guacamole, hamburgers. I came for the Asian food. Eatmate ordered the fish tacos and I ordered a noodle dish with shrimp. Disappointment arrived quickly in the form of the portion size. A very small bowl and only half full, flavorful, but the mood was set .\n\nServer, to his credit, reported my remarks to his manager who offered a new dish. I came for noodles so that was that. Fish tacos....they were OK according to eatmate, just not great.\n\nI appreciated the attentive service, although the wait staff was too aggressive, coming by every 5 minutes asking to remove my plates. Banana egg roll. Well that gets 4 stars. Will I be back to this L & L? Too many good choices at the Biltmore to give it a second try. Scottsdale L&L I love. What happened here???",215,1
"Like Fiona H. said Khorwa finally brought something different to this street- and by different I mean a clothe store that wasn't second hand. The dresses and tops are quite cute and summery most of lesser known labels. However, this shop always seems to be uncomfortably empty. I hardly ever see customers here which is surprising as it's convenient location you would think it would be heaving. \n\nIt's prices are reasonable and great if you can't be bothered to trek down to Princess street. Sizes on the other hand are a bit limited and a lot of the clothes require hand wash and no tumble dry- meaning you will probably hardly ever wash them.",140,2
"Nicole is awesome and amazing. Her prices are reasonable, and she does a great job. I can't think of a single beauty fix that is easier and gets better results than Nicole's lash extensions. I really appreciate that every time I go, she's raising the bar on herself, which she has already set very hight. She is always trying to find ways to make us more comfortable, or tweak my lashes so they look even better than before. It's a real pleasure to visit Nicole every 3-4 weeks, and I love all the compliments I've been getting on my lashes. Try Nicole, you'll be very happy with the results and the service!",141,4
"It has been a very long time since I have been as impressed by a meal. After moving to the North Phoenix area, I was excited to find a new Latin restaurant because I am a huge tamale fan. After reading reviews of Mi Comida, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a go. I will not bore you with what the inside looked like, or what the ambience was like. All you need to know is that the food is affordable, and it is DELICIOUS. The tamales may be the best I have ever had. The brisket was so tender that chewing was optional. The turnover was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Everything we have ordered there is a five star item, including the Brazilian beer I ordered on a whim. The most expensive item on the menu is less than $15, and the portions are hearty to say the least. This is the best restaurant I have eaten at in North Phoenix thus far, and may be for a long while.",204,4

"Solid 4 star buffet. My friends and I were in Vegas for a our friend's going away celebration. We do Vegas every summer so I guess you can say this was our kick off to summer event as well. We were walking around the Shops at the Forum when we got hungry. Totally came here by accident. Didn't even know CP had a buffet. This place must be fairly new. Boy are we glad we came here for lunch!\n\nHighlights\n- Fresh Juices: cucumber, orange, melon just to name a few. All pressed through the juicer.\n- Nice set up for the foods. Variety of foods from countries such as Asia, Mexico and the US. Just how most buffets are set up\n- Little Fry Baskets: they had little fry baskets filled with finger foods such as: buffalo wings, sweet potato fries and even chicken and waffles!\n- Desserts. Everything from cookies, cakes, pies, gelato and even those fancy macaroon things! \n\nServers were pretty friendly. Price was around 40+ including tip but that's expected when you go to Vegas. \n\nI would actually say this is one of the top 3 buffets in Vegas on my list.",258,3
"This is my go to 24 hour open diner near Plaza Midwood. Sure they have lots of standard blue plate special's, but check out their breakfast too. When you walk in they have a impressive dessert cabinet. Try their several layer chocolate cake with coffee-- anytime, day or night!",62,4
"This has to be the worst Outback. Service is slow, and last 2 times we were there, we have had to ask for silverware after our meal came. Pass this one by. Black Angus is not much better with their service, but it is down the road, as well as other places around the mall for steak.",67,1
Food is good. Reservations are hard to get. Place was pretty full when we went. We decided to skip the dining room and sit outside next to the fireplace.  We spent a few hours there andfinished a few bottles of wine.  Place is pricy but not too bad.\n\nThe staff just needs to be a little more attentive.,73,4
Change is not good!  The special 777 changed for the worse. No more salad included. They now give you Broccoli instead of a dinner salad.  What the hell?   Why change an old school staple?  Every restaurant in the hotel is constantly changing and it's not for the better!,65,0
This place is great. I needed a small storage unit for some stuff while i was in between apartments and they helped me out greatly. Anna was extremely helpful and kind. I'd keep storing here just because of her service. She's awesome and deserves a raise!!,56,4
"I was set to try a burrito and all the flavored fries....uh yeah they don't make them anymore. \n\nThey restructured their menu and it now includes only:\n\nTacos: beef, chicken, pork or tofu&egg,-  1- $2.78 or 2-$4.63\n(not so) Fries- seasoned fries $1.16 so no more flavor options\nCrazy Dough $1.16\nJumbo \""Nate\"" Dog $2.78\n12 oz Drinks $1\n\nWe got for ourselves, mom and grandma to share 4 pork tacos, 2 tofu&egg, 2 (not so) fries, and 2 crazy doughs. \n\nI'm going to be the first somewhat negative review, but seriously I came here excited for some \""Seoul\"" Fusion tacos and it came up short. Let me preface that I am from LA and have been eating my way through all the fusion food trucks when the craze started. You can say that I've had the standard, the grail to which I will judge all others heavily. Oh, and I know how to pickle, brine and kimchee with the best of them and I have done fusion tacos all my life being part of a blended family (filipino adobo tacos, ethiopian tibbs tacos, duck confit tacos, \""bahn mi\"" tacos, BBQ pulled pork and beer slaw...yeah I go there with my food). \n\nEven if I didn't have \""experience\"" in this food genre, there was something off about the food. Not trying to be the \""expert\"" asshole, but just saying, I know what kimchee should be like and what is good fusion since that is my style of cooking. Though the kimchee had a right amount of spice to set off the food but not  be overwhelming for meek palettes, the flavor was off and was going in a sort've bitterish, weird flavor that threw off all of us. That is my main shtick is the fusion part of the taco was not good- that is not how kimchee is supposed to be. It can be savory, a bit sour, a bit salty/briny, but bitterish and odd flavor I can't place is a no go. Best way I can describe it is if you were to botch up or have a spoiled batch of kimchee. I had a bad jar once and later found it wasn't not only sealed loosely, but my dad ate pieces out of it with the spoon he was eating lunch with contaminating it hence the off fermented spoilt flavor. So the tacos are fairly big flour tortillas but it was mostly filled with lettuce. The pork was cubes, not the usual shredded, and was soft and juicy and nice on their own, but sparse. The Tofu Egg had a lot of tofu egg in the taco compared to the pork.. It was mashed tofu mixed with the egg and with the very wet kimchee made for a soggy texture that just wasn't working for me. Also, the wetness made it a bitchfit to even eat the tacos because they were stuck to the paper container and ripped holes into my taco so it was then a \""bowl\"" instead of a taco. I think it needs a \""heavier\"" fry to stand up to the wetness of the kimchee (I personally would do crispy/fried tofu cubes and shredded omelette instead of blended together) or drain the kimchee a bit better before putting on the taco to avoid a large amount of the sog factor. The BF left this Tofu&Egg alone after a few bites and that guy kept saying \""I'm soo hungry\"" in the car after we decided to skip \""lunch\"" at 1, go to errands and go eat later here at 4. Apparently not hungry enough to down his taco. \n\nFries were yummy- crispy, not greasy and a good amount of seasoning on them. Crazy dough was good- it was crispy and doughy and not greasy at all, but it definitely needed more sugar coating on it (I dipped them in honey at home). \n\nI think Vegas needs street food since every great city has great street vendors so I give kudos to anyone who wants to get into the food stand/truck culture and start this city off. For that, I gave it a very fair 3 stars (being VERY nice) and for the fact that my fries and dough were tasty. However, I can't just live off dough and fries alone as a meal and I'm afraid as the way the cards fall that's all I'll be ordering and only if I'm at Lee's already feeling like having a snack. They were doing some sort of promotional stuff at Lees and even had a Hanshik raffle so very well an \""event\"" can boggle things up.  I will come back maybe in a few months and try one taco again to give it a fair chance, but as it stands it's something I hesitate ordering again. The BF does not want to go back, he says he was really disappointed.\n\n I was set to go to Blue Nile Ethiopian food for lunch, Crown bakery for dessert  and dinner at the Slider Truck then the BF got the idea to go to this instead to bring to his mom and grandma food who weren't feeling to well. Yeah, today I feel I got shafted out of a good eating day at three places to go to one place that didn't live to the hype....I was pretty pissed I starved part of the day to eat w/ the family instead at a place near them. I have to resurrect it myself by getting in my kitchen late tonight and doing up something Chef worthy. It might have been an off day for them and everyone can have that, but shit it made my seeming good day off. It wasn't their fault we chose to come at that day and time, but we expected something worth giving up my day for and that leaves me bitter as the kimchee.",1251,2
"So.... everyone seemed to have good things to say about this place, I might be the only odd one out. We went there on a Friday around lunchtime and the place only had couple tables to start. We were greeted by the hostess and we asked to see the menu first before deciding whether to eat here or not. The menu looked very appealing so we got a table. \n\nThe decoration inside was clean, appealing and very nice. Our server was very friendly and prompt. So why did I give this a 1 star?\n\nWe ordered off the lunch menu. DH got the T.L.B \""Tender Loving Bacon\"" (10.95) and I got the Shrimp Po' Boy (13.95). And we ordered the appetizer Pork Belly With Country Grits (9.95).  (See the pictures I posted)\n\nThe App came out in a decent amount of time, it was only 2 pieces of pork belly on top of some grits, the presentation is nice and the flavors were ok. But come on, it is not worth $9.95 price tag. Before we were done with our app the entrees came out. DH's T.L.B is a joke, size wise, it's like 4 bites and with 2 pieces of bacon and they call it a BLT and charge $10.95 for it?? It probably only cost them $2 at the most to make this at this portion. \n\nMy Po' Boy was decently sized, I got few pieces of large shrimp in mine. The flavor however is lacking. No seasoning whatsoever and the shrimp had a heavy shrimp smell to it (it wasn't very fresh). Both dishes came with a side of cole slaw and fries. The cole slaw did not have flavor, only a touch of vinegar. We both only ate one bite of it and that's it. The fries were good, crunchy and fresh out of the fryer.\n\nOverall, the food just did not live up to the description on the menu and it's way too overpriced. I know this location must have a high overhead but you cannot charge $10.95 for a kid's sized sandwich.",467,0

"Smooth jazz and good food makes a night a little extra special.  \n\nThis is Mike's Restaurant no longer.  Yorman has taken over and turned it into what they call \""Southern Fusion\"".  On either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday you can listen to live jazz as you eat, played by Yorman himself and his band as well as friends from out of town who come solely to play with Yorman.\n\nThe food itself was pretty tasty.  My lamb shank was fall off the bone tender and the sweet mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth.  The Chick Corea was wonderfully tender.  The Hanna Bay Rum Runner - chicken encrusted in pecan served in a sweet rum sauce - was alright, although I thought it would have been much better.  And it wasn't served in a sweet rum sauce...the waitress claims the chef drizzled it on top, but it came rather dry.\n\nDessert came in the form of homemade peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream made by Yorman's wife herself.  Tasty little number.\n\nAll in all, the prices were decent, service was good.  What gives that extra star was the live jazz.  I think if I had gone on a regular night this place would have received three stars.",269,3
"Customer Service is horrible at this location.  Absolutely no sense of urgency,  half the workers (ladies at the front counter) are always standing around talking and laughing regardless of how long the line is.  The posted hours on all websites including the official USPS website is 9am to 5pm, however today when I arrived at 4:29pm to pick up my package the doors were being locked internally by a postal worker.  I grabbed my phone to check the time, it was now 4:30...I stood there confused as to why the door was being locked.... Looking at the man on the other side of the door who was laughing as he shut the blinds and completely ignored me.... As if it was funny that he just locked me out.  I called USPS costumer service who confirmed that they are supposed to stay open until 5pm and advised me to file a complaint with the Postmaster.  If possible avoid this place....They are horrible when it comes to common courtesy and an awful representation of the USPS..... OH and don't bother calling.... Their phone line is ALWAYS busy.",229,0
"I hate to do it but I have to be honest based on MY experience of the place. \n\nI had been dying to try this place ever since I saw the awesome and tasty reviews on Yelp. And maybe that is my problem, maybe my expectations were SOOOO HIGH because of the reviews.\n\nEither way, I have ate at several donut shops in town and this donut shop lacked luster and taste for me.\n\nWe went to the shop a little after 7pm and good thing, because I thought they were open at 6pm but it looks like they have changed their hours. When we went it was 7pm, but I believe it might even be 8pm now.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly man and he was very helpful. He asked if I had been there before and because I had not, he gave us a couple of extra donuts.\n\nWe tried the cinnamon rolls, apple fritters, glazed, custard filled chocolate covered and a couple others I can't even remember now. \n\nCinnamon roll was too crispy and not enough flavor. For me a good cinnamon roll should have a nice bite because of the outside but be soft and have a good chew on the inside, especially when I get to the middle. The middle is supposed to be the best part but I was deeply saddened when eating this because I did not get that happy feeling at all. \n\nApple fritter was a huge disappointment too. \n\nHowever, I was greatly surprised by the custard filled donut. These are not my favorite at all but upon eating it I had wished that was all we got. They were soft, slightly sweet but not too sweet and delicious.  Only because of this donut do they get 3 stars, if it had not been for this donut I would have given only 2 stars.\n\nAlso, I was hugely disappointed because they had no french crullers even though we had visited during the weekend, when they are only available.\n\nObviously, I didn't have the freshest donuts and maybe I would go back if I knew exactly when they made their donuts so I could give them another shot but with other donut shops in town, I don't think it would worth it for me.\n\nAlso I thought they were a little pricey for a mom and pop donut shop. \n\nSorry Donut Hut. I was not a fan.",507,2
"Quite possibly one of the worst buffets in Vegas. Seriously, they're not even trying anymore. \n\nThe food was all bland and uninspired.

"I didn't have a waiter the entire time that I was here. I kept dealing with the bus boy to get things done, and he barely spoke English. No one seemed to care about the customers, and everyone was busy chatting with each other to even give us a refill of water. I will never eat here again. That being said, the food was alright, but there are much, much better places to dine at. Don't give your money to this place.",98,1
"I purchased a whole living room set and in the store the interactions and sales team was all fantastic.  \n\nThe day of delivery the delivery people had called to confirm a time frame and I said \""ok\"" and then they never showed up and I had to leave so I called the store and they weren't able to get ahold of the driver.  They told me I would have to reschedule and didn't even offer to refund the delivery fee, I had to.  I don't even want money back, I want my furniture!   But it's the principle.  Then, I reschedule it for a day that would not work for me (today) as they wouldn't make an exception to get it to me when worked for me because THEY screwed up.  Then today I call to reschedule it and they state it's already on the truck so I have to call back tomorrow.  I informed them that after waiting on hold for 10 minutes I would not be calling back and I demanded the store manager to call me.\n\nI'm a manager at a hotel where guests complain all the time and I would never inconvenience our guests like this.  I asked her to have it delivered on Thursday or Friday and the CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER (or she claims she was) stated she couldn't do that.  BS.  If you're in a management role in customer service and can't provide service to your customer you should find a new job.\n\nI'm beyond angry that I have been inconvenienced by this and would never buy from RC Willey or recommend anyone I know ever again.  Not to mention I STILL have no furniture",351,0
"I came during Wednesday ladies night. Guys hoping for easy pickups might be disappointed even though females get in for free. Guys are stuck having to pay a $7 cover but that didn't seem to discourage huge crowds of men from entering the place. From what I observed there were far more guys than gals so if it's a hookup place the odds are stacked in favor of predator females. \n\nBoth inside and outside areas were packed with mobs of people. \n\nMusic was painfully loud hip-hop (and not good hip-hop either, assuming there is such a thing). The PA system was being overdriven to the point that all you could hear is a loud \""thump da thump\"" and some screaching human voices. \n\nMost of the crowd were young -- lots of tattoos etc. The men dressed like gang bangers, thugs, and bums. Women looked like sluts and biker chics. Most of the females came and left in groups, so it didn't seem the young bucs were scoring very often.\n\nEveryone was yelling at each other so that they could be heard over the music. It was quite a cacophony. \n\nI had to wonder why young people are willing to put up with such abysmal conditions. Cheap drinks, perhaps? Everywhere it was crowded and hot, and the stench of sweat and vomit couldn't be avoided. If they are there to hook up, how do they find somebody when there is so much noise it's impossible to talk to each other (maybe that's the idea, LOL!).\n\nThe dance floor was small considering the size of the crowd -- but nobody knows how to dance anyway so who cares? \n\nI have heard WR is better in the early evening when the country dancers are there (I arrived after 11 pm). Once the hip hoppers arrive the adults leave. Maybe I'll try going there again for the country dancing but for now I got a belly full of the place.",422,0
"We chose Marisqueira for my mother-in-law's 82nd birthday. We are so glad we did and we will definitely be back.\n\nWe had 4:00 pm reservations in order to accommodate some of the members of our party who need to dine earlier in the day. When the first three of us arrived, we realized that the family member who had called in the reservation had erroneously said a party of five instead of six. \""No problem!\"" said the staff. They quietly and without any fuss moved us to a larger round table in order to accommodate our party. I'm not sure this would have been possible later in the evening as the restaurant became very busy, but we lucked out. Our waitress (Jennifer) was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the specials. She listed off about 10 different specials and appetizers and was able to circle back and answer our many questions about those specials and menu items.\n\nThe staff coordinated almost like a dining ballet. These were not staff who were only there to collect a paycheck. The dining professionals (that's what they were) wanted to make sure we truly enjoyed our experience. Their efforts did not go unnoticed and helped to make our dining experience special.\n\nEach person was given a large, hot, crusty roll before the meal. The wine list was generous with quite a few wines by the glass: red, white and sparkling. The menu was divided into starters, soups, salads and entrees divided into chicken, sea and others. I had the salmon with whiskey sauce with a side of rice and grilled vegetables. The portions are very generous, the whiskey sauce creamy, sweet and not so strong as to overpower the perfectly cooked fish.\n\nMy partner and I each had a bowl of soup, entree with sides, glass of wine and espresso and our total came to around $70 (not including tip). Really a great deal with the quality and quantity of the amazing meal. Everyone also received a small glass of Portuguese almond liqueur, on the house.\n\nWe can't wait to tell our friends about it and hope that they invite us to come along for dinner!",449,4
"Another lunch favorite!  I've been several times for lunch, and always eat at the buffet.  The food is delicious; there's various traditional options, including basmati rice, samosas, chicken dishes (e.g., chicken tikka), dal makhani, and other vegetarian dishes.  There's also fruit.  The buffet actually has a good variety of food.  \n\nMy absolute favorite is the sweet rice, which is orange colored and has peanuts (or cashews?) in it.  I have a sweet tooth and love rice, so this is the best of both worlds for me.  I'm not a huge meat eater, but am not vegetarian either so I end up loading up on the sweet rice.    \n\nMy runner-up favorite (or actually maybe tied) is the naan.  Whoa nelly, the naan is ALWAYS warm and soft.  We always get a basket that has plain naan and naan with garlic.  The garlic naan is super good.  Although I'm sure it's a huge faux pas, I love getting the orange marmalade from the buffet (for the fruit) and putting just a little on the naan.  That's my dirty little secret at Mt. Everest.\n\nOverall, it's a great place to have lunch.  It's generally busy or at least half way full.  I think it also feels a little nicer because the tables in the center of the restaurant have linen table cloths.  Oh! And another plus -- they usually have a Bollywood movie playing on a flat screen tv above the buffet.  The sound is not on or is low, but it's fun to watch nevertheless!",362,3
Great sandwiches and cookies.,6,3
Only giving this place 2 stars because of the friendliness of staff and my steak was rubbery .... seriously ... I paid almost 40 bucks for a steak I had to chew and chew and chew some more....If we didn't have such poor service (hardly checked on us) I would have sent it back  - the steak is supposed to melt in your mouth.  They also give a plate full of fries along with the steak and I think I have had better fries at a fast food joint ... sad I know because I paid over 100 bucks for two people .... lesson learned and never again.

"I waiver on how exactly to rate this return experience. Service was 1 star, entrees were 2 to 3 stars, and dessert was 5 stars. I think what we have concluded from this return experience is that the manager is awesome and it's best to stick to menu items containing chocolate (I really should've ordered that amazing crepe again).\n\nI suppose as to be reasonably expected, the place was packed. I must say that some of the tables are quite close together. The person sitting at the table behind me was constantly knocking into me throughout the course of our dining.\n\nOur server was...odd? I can't quite find the right word. It was the weirdest, and worst, serving experience I think I've ever had. So here's the somewhat play-by-play:\n\n- We sit for while. Server comes over, says nothing, and sets down napkins. \n- We sit there again for awhile. Server comes over and takes our drink and appetizer order, quickly picking up the menus and swiftly departing before we can finish ordering. Uh... \n- Server returns, says nothing, sets down forks, and quickly leaves again before we can say anything.\n- Server brings waters and apologizes for the drink wait saying it wasn't his fault (never thought that it was his fault). We then manage to capture his attention and place our entree order.\n- Wings arrive, but we have no plates or knives (yes, some of us are strange enough to want to eat wings with a knife and fork). But thankfully, the server eventually comes by to ask how everything is and we are able to ask for the knives and forks.\n- Drinks arrive, but he gives none of us straws (which ok, may not be totally necessary, but is customary for things like ice tea - and we wanted straws).\n- Server comes over and snatches the plate from in front of me (reaching across the table to do so), never saying a word (ok, yes, I was now done and all the other plates were already cleared, but it was really awkward and weird).\n- Entrees arrive (not delivered by our server). Server never comes over to check on how things are. We take our time eating - server never makes another appearance.\n- Manager comes over and asks how everything is (after we are almost all finished eating). He is very nice and insists that we tell him the truth about how everything was (maybe our exchanged glances gave us away when he didn't buy the whole \""everything's fine\""). My husband filled him in on some of the basics and he sincerely apologized and said dessert was on him.\n- We are asked if we want anything else to drink (by someone else, not our server). We all order re-fills finally.\n- Manager comes back and takes our dessert order.\n- Server comes by to ask if we are all set (our check in his hand). When my husband says that we are still picking at it (but otherwise all done), the server snatches the check back and speeds off. Uh...\n- Eventually, the server brings the check back and we pay.\n\nThe food was a-ok. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things? Or perhaps it was just that almost everything was over-cooked?\n\nThe excellent:\n- The wings were divine. Absolutely divine! Definitely 5 stars for the wings. Perfect size and meatiness. The sauce was amazing! It was a BBQ-type sauce, but with a slightly spicy kick and hints of orange (and everything had a very light dusting of chocolate). And the dipping sauce was fantastic. It was blue cheese with something I can't quite pinpoint added to it. So so yummy!\n\nThe good:\n- The home fries that came with my omelet were quite delicious. Perfect amount of crispy on the outside and perfect seasoning. And the diced peppers added a nice kick and sweetness to them.\n\nThe a-ok:\n- The hangover omelet was good. The fillings and cheese were very generous which I appreciated. The flavors were good. It just wasn't anything particularly notable. And it was a little over-cooked.\n- Pretty much ditto on the breakfast skillet my dad ordered.\n\nThe so-so:\n- The burger looked so insanely delicious, but it was well-done instead of the medium my husband had ordered. Now, of course, this didn't stop him from eating all of it. But then again, it's not like our server came over to ask how it was. (We were pleasantly surprised when the check arrived and the burger was taken off.)\n- The waffle fries were ok. Good crispiness, but the dusting of chocolate and chile powder didn't actually seem to add any flavor to them. Not as good and exciting as we anticipated.\n\nThe \""can't barely eat this\"":\n- My mom claimed the Belgian waffle was barely edible. She did not like how dense it was and felt it was over-cooked.\n\nNow, the desserts, of course, were divine. The chocolate fondue was delicious and fun. The chocolate truffle heart cake was amazingly decadent. And all of the presentations were amazing and perfect.\n\nIn conclusion, we will definitely be here again, but I hope we have a different server and we'll be sticking to the chocolate-based menu items (and, of course, the wings!). And big props to the manager - he kinda saved our experience this time",1156,2
"Eight and seven and six and\ntummies tucked\nshoulders back\ntighten, and breath and breath...\n\nFive and four and three\nchin is up\nchest it out\ntighten and squeeze and squeeze\n\n... and two and one ... hold.\n\nAh! The Dailey Method helped firm my rear, but not before it kicked it up and down that instruction room. Big thanks to Gabi K to dragging me out to my first ever DM class.\n\nAn equal mix of cardio, resistance, yoga and Pilates, I've never felt like this immediately after a class: arms felt heavy, limbs stretched, and back loose as a goose. \n\nLet me say that this particular class was not easy--nor was standing in the front right next to the instructor (no way I could sneak in a two-second break). It takes a decent amount of coordination and listening skills, but even if that doesn't top your resume, don't be deterred from at least trying TDM.\n\nWomen of all shapes, sizes, flexibility and strength were in this class, and as the instructor said, you may not be able to touch your toes on the dance bar, but you'll eventually get there. \n\nIt's a non-stop workout, and though you may be cursing your instructor as you hold a V-up for a few seconds, in the end you'll have a huge grin on your sweaty face knowing you just did a wonderful thing for your body. Great music, a spunky instructor and a few good laughs make it an entertaining class as well. \n\nAn individual class for first timers is $20, which is steep if you anticipate on continuing on a few times a week; so I suggest the new client unlimited special for $100 ($200 for returning clients).\n\nWear yoga pants and somewhat form-fitting clothing so that instructors can see if your poses are correct. (Loose shorts aren't recommended. Your legs will be stretched up over a ballet bar, in the air and all over the place--with mirrors.) And socks are required (you may want to spring for those fancy socks with grippers at the bottom so you don't slide around), so don't forget! This location has a clean locker room, showers, and even a small children's area for the rugrats. Oh, and the spunky owner Linda's little dog is absolutely adorable! \n\nHoping TDM opens up a location in Houston soon, til then, I'll have to wait. Luckily, I'm in SF (home to TDM) for the week and am taking as many classes as my schedule and budgie allow.",578,3
"My family was in town and wanted to do the touristy things. I always wanted to browse this store, specifically since I heard they have so many kinds of M&Ms. \n\nThey have different COLORS, but not a lot of different FLAVORS. I don't care if my plain or peanut M&M's are cute colors. There was pretzel and dark chocolate flavors at the dispenser and I saw coconut packages by the register. I mean, even certain candy stores has more M&M's flavors than that. I was hoping they'd have some of the limited releases like the PB&J, mocha, white chocolate, mint, etc being sold at the M&M's store. All other branded candy stores like Kit Kat store carry all the fun, hard to find flavors.\n\nBasically- if you want chocolate then buy at your grocery.

"The only reason Fat Heads does not get a 5 star from me, and I know this is nit-picking, is that it's so darn loud inside.  I have to yell to be heard and have to lean in to hear, but that is the only thing wrong with this place.  Every sandwich I have had was a masterpiece of flavors and textures.  Last night I had the Chicken Little which was another amazing sandwich.  Rarely do I NOT have a favorite dish at a restaurant, but Fat Heads is my exception.  I want to try something new every time I stop in because I know it's going to be delicious.  It's usually a wait to sit down but it's worth every minute when you're taking that first bite of some of the greatest sandwich concoctions thought up.\n\nSo you're thinking, \""How could there be any more win packed into this place?\""  I haven't mentioned that Fat Heads brews their own beer.

"If you want to get off of the strip and go to a GREAT local casino, Ellis Island is real good.\n\nGaming:  Slots, roulette, black jack, craps and some other poker-type tables.

All of the other food is really good, too, and very reasonable.  The place is also a brewery, and it is the best beer I can get anywhere.  But, be careful, it is strong.  Drinking four beers seems like drinking eight.  Best of all, the beers are $2 for a 22oz!  I love this place.\n\nThey also have karaoke, other restaurants, a BBQ restaurant (really good) and a pretty good players' club.  The staff is either really good, or basically rude.  In the restaurant you always get great service.  At the bar and casino floor, either the staff is really positive and helpful, or \""leave me alone\"" and mean.  \n\nOverall I love this place and will go back every time a visit Vegas.",257,3

Perfectly cooked pillows are stuffed with flavorful goodness. Again, it was wonderfully scrumptious. \n\nDessert was tiramisu with coffee ice cream. Perfection.

"I didn't get to check out Garrett's in Chicago and I was surprised to see one in Vegas.  I had to check it out.  Being into deals and coupons, my bf actually found a coupon in the Planet Hollywood shopping directory for a free small bag sample of the Chicago Mix which was the cheesecorn and the caramel corn.  \n\nThe cheesecorn I really enjoyed but i think it's because it was pretty greasy for a cheese flavored popcorn.  Anything greasy usually tastes good to me!  The caramel corn was REALLY sweet.  I'm not a fan of caramel alone, so I knew I wouldn't like the caramel corn too much.  \n\nI also tried a sample of the kettle corn which tasted like any others...It didn't taste too out of the ordinary.  I hope I'm not being too harsh but I didn't think Garrett's was what it was hyped up to be.  The service was excellent--but I think I was more excited with the fact that I got free samples of popcorn than the popcorn itself.",230,2
"I usually come here for lunch.  If they are busy, which they usually are, prepare to wait for you lunch 30-45 minutes, if you come around 11am then the wait shouldn't be that long at all.

"I took my first trip to Vegas and was so- excited to try this restaurant out.  I have always wanted one of their frozen hot chocolates.  I luckily found a groupon which was even better.  First the service was sub par.  They had 3 hostesses that stand around. They also do not have bathrooms in the restaurant.  You have to go outside walk around and then go down into this \""cave\"".   Then the public restroom was gross and reminded me of nasty public park toilets (they are metal toilets). It took about 20-30 minutes once seated just to get our water! The house salad was mediocre.  Their balsamic was ok.  My friend and I both got burgers.  I got the ABC burger because that is what the waiter said was their good one and it was the blandest thing ever.  I didn't even eat half of it.  The burger had no seasoning, the had no seasoning, and they didn't put condiments on it.   They have a lot of fries already made up so they were not the best and luke warm.  We did have their romano cheese onion rings.  Those were WONDERFUL.  I would totally eat those again.  My friend and I also shared a frozen hot chocolate.  It was ok.  I make them at home with real chocolate but the one here tasted like it had a slight powder taste.  I probably would have liked it better if I never had made my own to get that true delicious chocolate taste.  All in all I will not be back to eat, but maybe grab the onion rings to go.",336,1

"I was a big fan of Lis Doon Varna, the original restaurant that the building was built and housed for some years before its untimely closure earlier this year. It was the most authentic Irish restaurant I've been to in Arizona (see: *most*, though it couldn't be labelled *an* authentic restaurant) and I was really sad it closed.\nI thought I'd give the building's new owner a try and I can't help but compare it to Lis Doon on every level. The inside is completely the same - they must have acquired all the furniture and fixtures along with the unique building. They seem to have added some random photos and things on the wall (framed ink-jet print-outs of the Kennedy family add a touch of class) to make it theirs but it's mostly the same.\n\nThe menu is where things get really different. Johnny Fox's menu is a lot smaller and a lot less Irish. The prices (a bit on the expensive side) are about the same but it seems like it's all the usual \""pub food\"" you find in \""Irish\"" restaurants around Phoenix. Nothing original here and it makes me sad to see things like Alfredo sauce covered pasta on the menu. I opted for a cup of the shrimp bisque and the sausage roll appetizer with a bottle of Magner's while mom went for the cottage pie (misnamed Sheppard's pie on the menu) and house white wine. The bisque was very good and came in a small casserole dish with a handful of soup crackers on the side. The sausage rolls were AWESOME though I'm not sure what type of \""sausage\"" they used - seemed a bit hot doggy but still tasted good. Those were filled with onions, mustard and baked in pastry dough and went well with my cider and bisque. The cottage pie wasn't anything special but was also good. Definitely not worth its $14 price tag, though. I could make better at home for around $5 in ingredients (and who gets the idea that food originally devised for poor people by poor people can be over $10 a plate?). \n\nService was decent though the waitress was super perky. Pro tip for customer service: If you're giving way more than you get back, maybe tone it down a bit. It just puts the customer off. We were also served the wrong table's plates  and the waiter said, \""Ugh, *someone* is putting the wrong table numbers in!\"" obviously referring to our waitress. Very professional. The food also took awhile (the food wrongly served us would have been about the right time for restaurant food, but ours took another 15 or so minutes after that -  I could only assume ours had been served to someone else) though the waitress did pop by to say our food was on its way instead of leaving us hanging.\n\nOver all, I will very much miss what Lis Doon Varna was and will not be back to this restaurant. The d\u00e9cor alone is just simply not enough to make it worth my time. I'll keep a look out for some real Irish fun here in the desert (though I'm not holding my breath).",671,1

"I tried Zack's out on a Friday night after work.  I can see not being open on a Sunday, but not being open on a Saturday?  If that's what you want to do more power too them.  It was a beautiful day out and I was glad they had tables outside.  Zack's is a lot like the drive ins I've been to in other cities over my lifetime.  It's kind of run down and divey, but lots of good places are.  They were pretty busy and seemed a little frazzled behind the counter.  It took me a while to order even though there was one person ahead of me in line because when I got to the counter the server got a phone order and took it instead of waiting on me.  Pet peeve of mine, deal with the customers in front of you rather than those on the phone.  There were two other servers and a manager or owner back there that could have been taking phone orders.  I ordered a Zack's special, onion rings, and large shake.  I had to try the rings because those are one of my favorites things and they can show just how good a place is.  It didn't take too long to get my food and I head outside to sit on their patio.  I started with the rings and they were great.  They looked liked they used the same batter as on their chicken.   The burger looked like it was made fresh and not a frozen patty.  It was supposed to come with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, mayo, and special sauce.  Mine just had the lettuce, tomato and onion.  The beef was cooked well done but still juicy and not to greasy.  It was a good burger.  The fries were shoe string cut and crispy.  No complaints there.  I ordered a large shake, but it didn't seem very large.  Overall I would come back if nothing else for the onion rings.  The price is pretty reasonable too.",416,2
"We arranged for a group of 40 of us cyclists to have lunch here. As a former server let me say 40 people is a lot to handle, even if your business does it often. The staff were all very helpful and polite and the burgers were all very unique and tasty. I had the Philly cheesesteak burger with garlic and jalape\u00f1o fries. Wow! Very very good burger and I have pretty decent standards for those. The only thing that would keep me from giving 5 stars here is that they had no draft beer as the line for the kegs were blown. This is forgivable usually but the only thing they had for bottles were your typical domestic lagers which aren't my favorite. Still well done for serving 40 people.",165,2
"Happened upon Big Apple Bagels when eating at Peking Tokyo and decided to try them out this morning for breakfast. YES... a good bagel place in Fort Mill besides the packaged nonsense at Starbucks. \n\nFriendly staff, well-priced and enjoyable. \n\nI'd say give this place a look as we were quite satisfied.",72,4
"The coconut slushie with boboa so so SO good on a HOT day.  OK, any day.  It is so freaking warm in the store when you wait for your drink, sorry I needed to list that is a con.

"Ok, it's time to update this review.  We stayed here for 3 nights on a recent Vegas trip and during all 3 nights, at least 1 elevator was out of order which caused a traffic jam to go up/down the hotel tower.  It took FOREVER to get back to our room!  Besides that, all of the same things are still here....bad cigarette smoke and the food options are terrible....except for Ping Pang Pong, which is the only reason why I gave this place 2 Stars instead of 1.\n\nReturn Factor 10% (to eat at Ping Pang Pong)",130,1
"It's probably a good thing I don't live in Madison. This place is way too good. Yes, it's only dumplings, but that's the point! And they're so good they scare me! I got the mix with the works and wanted to eat there at every meal. The guys working in there were nice, as well. I read some reviews that stated that the employees weren't nice, but I had a great experience.  I got a window seat and enjoyed watching people walk by while I enjoyed my fabulous food at an affordable price.",119,4
I was very under whelmed by the cupcakes. After reading a number of good reviews I assume one of two things has happened. A) I came on the wrong day and happened to catch a couple old cupcakes (my family and I ordered three all were the same) or B) The owner had every friend post positive reviews. \n\nI may have given three stars but the cupcakes were THREE DOLLARS a piece!! They would be decent at a dollar or one fifty at the MOST. I highly doubt I will be back.,109,1
"Ok, don't freak out when you first walk in. This is what one might call a \""hole in the wall\"" sort of place, however it carries the fame of hole-in-the-wall places - FABULOUS FOOD.\n\nThere is just something magical about this place.....every dish is just so flavorful, it's insane. The best pho and bun I've had in phx is definitely here! Now, please, when you go, do not expect the best of service. There is only ever one person cooking and one person serving. This place get's PACKED and he (the server/owner) often get's behind. Usually there are several tables full people or the dirty dishes they leave behind. You may have to wait a bit for a clean table, however once you order, the food comes fairly fast.\n\nNumber 42 is AWESOME if you are in the mood for Bun, and for Pho, you must try the rare beef. Remember, come for the food, not the service!",218,3
"I live near this car wash and can hear the radio playing from 7am until 9pm at night. I have been over there multiple times to ask them to turn it down. They have refused. Ironically they have signs posted everywhere for their customers to not play loud music for it may bother the neighbors. Well the car wash music is all I hear. They are the ones bothering the neighbors and their management does not care. They are very sarcastic and not willing to compromise. If I could give them zero stars, I would. Please turn down the music.",115,0
"Consistently really delicious food - I've been here three times with different groups, and no dish has disappointed.  The fish n chips is the best I've had in Champaign, with a light crunchy batter and perfectly cooked fish.   Corned beef and cabbage is also really great, served with kale mashed potatoes, red cabbage, and a yummy horseradish sauce.  My only complaint is that the corned beef is thinly sliced like it belongs on a sandwich instead of a pile of potatoes.  \n\nDon't skip dessert!  The bread pudding is absolutely ridiculous, and the chocolate cake does not disappoint.  My first choice in downtown Champaign.",138,4

"I wasn't to happy with this place.  Location is great in the Scottsdale Quarter, but the food was bland.  I have had better burritos at roadside stands.  This place definitely misses the mark in Mexican food.  They base their whole menu around the street tacos. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but from a restaurant that looks upscale it didn't deliver. We may come back to this place but not anytime soon.",91,1
"I had a chance to visit a few days before the New Year and had mixed feelings after leaving. \n\nFirst, the place was incredibly busy when we walked in...don't mind waiting.\n\nTook a while for our waters to come out...not a problem. \n\nWaited a while for the waitress to take our order....ok, i had great company so we will let it slide. \n\nHowever, the waitress communication with us when she did take our order was a bit choppy. When she did give us attention it was very minimal and I felt a bit unsatisfied with the experience. \n\nCalamari was solid along with the pizza we ordered.\n\nIt seems like they have their regulars and it maybe a family run establishment so we will give them another shot in the future but will keep this at a three star \""average rating\"" until proven otherwise.",191,2
"This is by far the worst airport ever. We have went to 3 different food place to eat and have had a bad experience at all of them. The first one took over  an hour tonget our drink order then came back and said oh you have 5 minutes to order I said ok I'll take this sandwich \""oh we don't have it or this or this \"" that was a larger portion of the menu so we said well I guess we are not eating here finished our drinks had to go ask for the check and meantime I saw our server dig in the trash for silverware and not wash his hands before grabbing food! The bk and taco place was also awful workers seemed extremely rude and bk took 15 min but the food was right there the whole time. Just don't eat here stay away avoid at all cost !",172,0

"I would give this place NO stars if I could. Went there for lunch with a friend when we were craving mexican cantina food (hoping it would be like paradise cantina). At around 11:45am it was still pretty empty so we were seated quickly and the server came over and took our drink order. He asked if he could sit down a few times which I thought was totally inappropriate seeing as he interrupted our conversation to ask. I was initially craving a taco salad of some sort but the only dressings they had to offer were Caesar and Italian. I was hoping for a more south of the border salad so I chose the chicken enchiladas (who doesn't love rice and beans and sauce!!) my friend ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. Our server told us that he didn't like our choices and tried to push us toward other (more pricy and larger dinner entree style) options. We explained why we chose what we chose and our food was delivered to us within 5 min. I'm not usually one to be negative about quick service but 5 min seemed a little microwaved or pre-cooked and warmed up to me. Regardless we thanked them for the quick service. We the dishes were put down in front of us my friends chicken sandwich looked good. Hot, crisp but thick french fries and a juicy chicken filet. My chicken enchiladas however were topped with a red sauce that tasted like a pizza sauce or thin marinara and then melted over everything was SWIS CHEESE. WTF?!?! I had my friend taste everything just to be sure I wasn't losing my mind and sure enough....italian red sauce and swiss cheese covered my enchiladas. SO WEIRD!! Needless to say I eat much of the enchiladas and was looking forward to the rice and beans but even they were \""rice a roni\"" style spanish rice and the beans weren't fresh or very good either. SO GROSS!!! \nThe busier was quick to clear our plates but that was when the quickness stopped. The restaurant was no busier than when we arrived but we had to wait 45 minutes for the server to bring us the check and another 20 minutes for his to run our credit cards. He about disappeared a few times. I think it's really sad when it takes only 5 minutes from ordering our food to receiving our food and then an hour to pay the check?! COME ON FLAMINGO....UP YOUR GAME HERE. THE PRICES ARE WAY TO HIGH AND THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE AND THE SERVICE WASN'T REALLY THERE.",527,0

"Think Costco Light.\n\nThe easiest way to describe Smart & Final is a warehouse club store, only half the size and with no membership fees. The store has a huge selection of items (mostly in bulk sizes), and the prices are slightly cheaper than your average grocery store. \n\nWhere Smart & Final excels is its big selection of random items you can't find at your average grocery store. Smart & Final has good selection of restaurant supply and items that would be used by professional chefs/bakers. If you're really into cooking like a Food Network star, you can find great stuff here that you can't find anywhere else. \n\nFor the average shopper (like me) Smart & Final is a solid place to get food and supplies for a big event like a party or barbecue.  In that case; it's better than Safeway or Fry's, and an easier place to shop at than Costco or Sam's.",200,2
"i was SOOOO excited that a cupcakery was finally opening in madison, and rushed over during their first week.  i was a little bit disappointed when i looked into the bakery case and saw a rather homogeneous bunch of cupcakes.  it was their first week, so i will cut them some slack for their utter lack of creativity. i also thought perhaps their lack of external pizazz would be compensated by really great flavor.\n\nthis was sadly not the case.  the cupcake itself a little bit dry for my liking, but also very bland.  it tasted like a lot of flour mixed with a little sugar, and very little else.  the frosting was the real let down though. my \""blueberry\"" frosting (recommended by the girl at the counter, who also seemed to have no idea what she was doing) tasted like butter. whipped butter.  i didn't taste even a hint of blueberry, despite its tepid cornflower color.  i could barely taste any sugar. it was a huge let down.\n\nmy girlfriend and i, avid cupcake lovers, couldn't finish our one little cupcake.  i was so disappointed, i haven't been back since. however, a few of my friends are more forgiving, and went back. each and every time they have been disappointed. i hope that the daisy cafe can step it up and provide some tasty cupcakes- i really want to like them, and they are right down the street from me. but for now, i'll keep buying carl's cakes at montys.",321,0

I got their special, which was chicken fingers and fried crimini mushrooms on bread.  The mushrooms were stuffed with a heavenly cheese/basil/deliciousness.  I still don't think you could have eaten it with your hands as an actual sandwich, but I don't really care, because it was very tasty.  I can't wait to eat there again, and I've been recommending it to everyone I see.",127,4

"Lured in by seductive reviews and copious, drool-inducing food porn, my expectations were set high for Waffles Incaffeinated.  We arrived just before 10 on a Saturday morning and were seated in about 2 minutes in a packed house.  We must have timed it jusssssst right because a wait formed after us with guests lining the sidewalk to wait for waffly bliss.\n\nOn deck - coffee, an order of sweet potato waffle fries with the marshmallow dip, a Souther' and the special.  \n\nCoffee was on point.  Very good coffee, hot, and frequently refilled by our attentive waitress.\n\nWaffle Fries - fries were standard, it was the dip we were looking forward to!  Unfortunately, the dip came served to us pretty cold, and the marshmallow had set so that it was almost impossible to dip.  The dip was delicious, but serving temperature is key on this one.  Cold marshmallow = high viscosity.\n\nWaffles - both entrees were good.  I really liked the Souther', which had plenty of jalapenos tucked IN to the waffle.  I'm not used to having my mouth tingle while eating waffles, which was great.  Sadly, the waffles were a little cold for both my wife's entree and my own.  They were slammed - I get it - but I shouldn't see the cheese only half-melted and cooled enough to re-harden when the plates are being dropped at the table.\n\nWe enjoyed WI and we'll go back, and I hope the cold entrees and app were just a fluke.  If that's the case, we'll be in 4-star territory on our way to 5.",370,2
"I went here last Saturday for lunch for a graduation party.  This place was pretty and spacious.  I really liked the setup as well.  First place I went to was the \""comfort food\"" section.  They had mash potatoes, corn on cob, cornbread, bbq chicken and bbq pork.  The bbq pork was the best part.  it was juicy.  The asian food section was ok.  The egg rolls were pretty good.  I was expecting sushi, but no sushi.  They even had a section with  pita bread with dips with deli meats.  I have never seen this kind of section in any buffet.  I thought this was interesting.  They had the normal roast beef, prime rib, and ham.  They also had mongolian bbq.  I was impressed with the comfort food section.  Service was great.

"I came here with my daughter on May 7th 2014 and then again on May 21st 2014. On the 21st, I was waiting for my daughter to be finished with her nail drying and as I was waiting, I noticed their inspection review posted on the wall. I began reading it and every technician was red flagged. Every single one. The inspector had so much to write about he/she wrote all the faults and flags in between preprinted words, around the outsides of the page, and on the back. For each tech under the comment field, he/she had to write so small about all their short-comings that it was very difficult to read. From what I gathered, it was mostly how each tech wasnt cleaning their tools properly, unsanitary, bacteria found.  The date for the inspection was May 8th 2014. The one line that stuck with me was \""not a single bottle of disinfectant/tsa or liners throughout the entire salon nor at any nail stations\"". When I was finished reading, I turned around and found that management the receptionist and a few other techs were watching me. I asked when their next inspection will be, and they said \""no need, we passed\"". I said, \""according to this, clearly not\"". I got a shrug of the shoulder and a back to my face. When I paid, I didnt offer a tip, and the receptionist asked me if I was going too, I informed her that I shouldnt be paying for anything,  but because I didnt come in here to get something for free nor an infection or worse HEP C, I certainly wont be giving a tip. Needless to say, I wont be going back. IMHO.",363,0
"Lovely setting, very good brunches & lunches, but after 5-6 times over the last few years, it's clear the Graze cooks just can't prepare a good dinner. Excellent ingredients but consistently put together in ways that don't work - the food just tastes 'blah' and this has been noted by numerous people I've hosted. In addition, the three Pub Burgers we ordered last night were all *very* well done despite requests for two mediums and one medium rare. I usually order 'well done' but have been trying to train myself to like medium burgers and the one I got was like a hockey puck wrapped in hay.

"I was really excited about this food truck.  The concept is definitely unique and who wouldn't like a bun stuffed with mac and cheese.  The staff is really nice and I really like the sides.  The truffle tater tots are to die for and the Frisco garlic fries are also great.  But the buns are pretty bland.\n\nI came to the grand opening at Costco and I've tried to visit every time they are at Costco so I could try all the buns.  I've tried everything except the sloppy bun, a bun stuffed with spaghetti, which I am eager to try but they've been out.\n\nThe pork special (now called Hot Pig?) is ok but not spicy.  \n\nDad's picadilly is interesting, but not very tasty.  Like taco meat with some vegetables in it.  There is dill in the bun, but I couldn't really taste it.\n\nMac and cheese bun (now McCheesy, I think) is mac and cheese in a bun.  There is supposed to be mushrooms and/or truffle in the bun but I could not taste either.  But the second time I tried it, I got more truffle flavor in the mac and cheese. But I think I built this one up too much in my head and it just disappointed me in the end.\n\nBBQ rib bun was ok.  There is cilantro in the bun, but I can't really taste it.\n\nThe bacon bird bun is probably my favorite so far.  Nice bacon flavor and very creamy.  But again, not getting much flavor from the bun.\n\nI also tried the Me fries but they are a little overwhelming with the egg.  I could not finish it all.  I'll probably stick with the Frisco fries.\n\nThe dessert potstickers are super sweet.  So sweet they hurt my teeth somehow.  Unfortunately I just can't deal with the sweetness, but I've only tried the smores potstickers, which are fried pastry potstickers stuffed with chocolate and covered with condensed milk and graham crackers. Maybe others are less sweet.  You can try all three if you order the happy ending.  Cute.\n\nThis is the only food truck I've encountered anywhere that does not include tax in the price.  So bring change or expect to get a lot back.  3 buns are $6 without tax but $6.49 with tax, if that helps.\n\nThat being said, it's a new truck and has a lot of potential.  It looks like they are changing up the menu and making new items.  So I'll likely be back for the sloppy bun and other menu items. If something strikes my fancy, I'll definitely re-review.",590,2

"I remember many years ago how much I loved going to Captain Bills. \nMy mom found this place and I loved the stickers and the subs were good. \nPlus i was cheap enough that my mom could afford it.\nI decided to bring my brother who lives out of town here even though i hadn't been in awhile, and I brought my three year old daughter. A mistake I will not make again. \nFirst off, there was no sourdough. Which there definitely used to be. \nMy sandwich was pretty bland, it tasted like bread and thats about it. Plain white bread. Yum! Glad I drove out of my way for it. \nThen, the most awesome part. My kid needed to use the bathroom, but oh wait....They don't have one that their customers can use. i was instructed to go ask the Mexican place across the street. Thats what I want to do! Pick up my three year old and drag her across the parking lot and pray that we make it in time. I won't be coming back. The once funny stickers it seems are only updated with political crap instead of general humor, the once great subs are bland, their service varies depending on which high school student you end up getting but most of the ones I've encountered during the times I've gone had attitudes that I chose to ignore because it was a fun, unique place that had good subs, and finally....to end this huge run on sentence there isn't even a bathroom to use. Just that, in itself is enough where I'd question going back but the whole experience including the food is just not worth making the trip there any longer.

I remember when it opened: it was one of the few spots downtown I liked to go, grab a pint of beer and order some nice pub food on your nice terrasse.

And the waiters were rude, you could feel they were rushed to serve too many people at the same time!\n\nI could have excused it if it happened only one time, but two in the same month? Nope.

"I normally don't write reviews below a 4 or if I've only visited once, but we had some of the most terrible service I've ever encountered. I brought my friend out to see chandler when she was in town and found this place through Yelp. We were seated at hi top by the bar, which was fine, because it was a busier Friday night. A waiter came over for our drink orders and then.... We got our bottle of wine but not iced teas. We asked again, knowing it was busy, but no dice (that time or the next time we asked). We then asked about the cheese plate. Our server didn't know what was on it and took ten minutes finding somebody who did. It was paltry at best for $14, but that's the nature of cheese plates. We asked about the specials and the waiter went off to find somebody who knew, again. He was gone for 30 minutes. No further service during this time. At this point we were so frustrated that we decided to leave. We asked for the check (which took 10 minutes) and then the waiter very awkwardly asked if he had done anything wrong :/ \n\nBased on that time only, I would give this place a 1. Since it was my first time and a Friday, I feel like that isn't fair. I did want to leave this review though so management is aware of some deficiencies in service. \n\nWe left, went next door to San Tan on a very busy Friday and had dinner, beers, AND iced teas and were out the door in 45 minutes.",339,1

"I was really excited to visit this famous Charlotte patisserie not only because everyone was raving about the their delicious tarts, croissants, & eclairs, but also because it's open ALL THE TIME (24hrs/day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year) and they are welcoming of all kinds of people to hangout, read, study.\n\nFirst off, the good: \n- Salted Caramel Brownie (5 stars): the PERFECT contrast of smooth sweet/salty caramel atop a thin but dense (and slightly crunchy) chocolate brownie.  You must try this if you love either caramel or brownies!\n- Their creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was delicious, and the fact that they flamb\u00e9/torch it only when ordered so it's warm, fresh, and crispy was a nice touch. \n- Finally, the chocolate eclair and mixed-berry tart were both very decent and I'd happily order them again.\n \nThe only downside is that it was abundantly clear that those long hours really diminished the quality of at least 2 of their items: \n- The croissant: I had already ordered a few items so I wasn't planning to get anything else, but I'm a sucker for a great croissant and the lady at the counter said it was fresh baked that morning, so I happily ordered it expecting a soft, flaky, buttery snack. Unfortunately what I got was hard and dry; honestly, I've had day old croissants taste fresher than this!  I have no doubt that if it were fresh out of the oven it would have been amazing, but someone definitely wasn't keeping track of how old/dry these were.\n- The sticky-bun (mini cinnamon roll + raisins & extra sugar glaze on top): it also was was disappointingly \""aged\"" liked the croissant, and although I've got a notorious sweet tooth, this tasted way too sugary too me.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back for their delicious snacks/desserts that are not too perishable and to try their famous macaroons.  As for the disappointing croissant,  I'd be willing to try it again if I KNEW it was fresh, but otherwise skip it.",477,2
"I had pro diesel look at a truck I was thinking about buying as I live 500 miles away and was only going on pics. They found two minor things wrong but over all said it was a good truck.\nSo on their recommendation I flew out to buy the truck. Upon seeing the truck and inspecting it myself, it was a hunk of junk so I flew back home and was out the cost of a round trip flight and their inspection fee. I would never use them to inspect a truck again.",106,0
"I stumbled on this place because it was close to my hotel while I was on business.  I couldn't believe my luck!  Everything I ordered was delicious.  I ordered the citrus spare ribs, which were so good that I ate the leftovers at the airport the next morning (that's saying something, for a business traveler!), and the lemongrass noodle soup, which was so generously portioned (and packed perfectly for takeout so the noodles didn't get mushy) and amazingly flavorful!  The broth was to die for and I'm usually a little underwhelmed by pho broth.  I also went a little crazy and ordered the autumn rolls, which were fresh and tasty.  I live in NYC and wish I had this place near my home!  I will definitely return here for the delicious food and friendly service when I'm back in the area!",180,4
"I was expecting this place to be more like Create where we walked up to the counter to make our selection, but I was surprised that it was a sit down restaurant. The burgers are great and definitely better than Create. However, that quality does cost. This is why they lost a star. I don't mind paying for good, quality food, but there's other burger places I prefer over Grind (e.g. Bachi Burger, Slidin Thru, Smashburger).\n\nI also got a side of Onion Strings and I'm so glad I got it to share with the rest of my table. Because it was HUGE. It was piled up on a entree sized plate.\n\nIt's a good restaurant but my taste buds prefer a Banh Mi Burger over the ones I can find at Grind.",172,2
"Again, caveat lector, I don't like Chinese food very much or very often. After my last excursion for Chinese, I've become a brand loyalist to Golden Harbor Unfortunately for me, G.H. was packed like sardines tonight.\n\nThus, it was Rainbow Garden, and perhaps we should chalk it up to my perpetually low expectations for Chinese, but I actually enjoyed this place. It's fairly reasonably priced, the decor is nice (i.e. not a whole in the wall) and unlike G.H., it's more of a traditional restaurant service experience. \n\nWhere Rainbow Garden is scoring most of its points is that, as some of the other reviews have noted, the service was fantastic. By that I mean, we had food within 10 minutes of ordering it and glasses that never really got empty.\n\nThe food was good, I suppose. I liked it enough. I'd come back. I wish they gave me some more rice though. I like a lot of rice.",216,3
"After taking my two rescue dogs here for about 1year my opinions have changed. They all have been very nice and good to my animals. My dogs get yearly exams, shots, and one teeth cleaning. They have always taken their time with me and answered my questions during the exam. Nice.  The two questions two of the vets couldn't answer were not followed up on like they said they would. Not the end of the world. \n\nHowever, this summer I was informed by the office manager and Dr. Varela that he would not be taking either of my dogs into the back without giving the the optional Bordatella shot. Their 'new office policy', sent down from above.  They gave a handful of reasons and Varela got uppity and scowly with me so I quickly debated. Went ahead with it because I wanted to get the inexpensive procedure done on one of the dogs that day, and pick up the free coupon RX diet food for the other. Fine. \n\nThe procedure done on one, two trips into the back room for weights & measuring for the other to get her free food and I was out the door. Do you think I had to pay for a Bordatella for the other dog who went back twice? THEY DIDN'T EVEN ASK! \n\nHow \""mandatory\"" could an optional/voluntary Bordatella shot be if they don't even follow their own regulations?\n\nShouldn't the pet owner be able to decide this? I think all pets should have their legally required shots and surgeries! The rest is at my discretion, as I see the need for. Especially when Bordatella is designed to prevent kennel cough when dogs are boarded. Boarding my dogs? Never!\n\nBordatella shots are currently $10.00 and last 6 months. Each dog X 2 shots yearly per each pet owner = you do the math and watch your pocket book!",398,1
"Even if you don't consider yourself a whiskey fan, I would highly recommend taking the tour. Not only will you learn how whiskey and other spirits are made, you will also learn the history behind distilleries in Pennsylvania. Haven't you always wanted to know why there's a noose on the Wigle logo? This is a family run business, and the owners seemed very friendly and knowledgeable. I like the fact that they use locally sourced grains, and the resulting product is also quite drinkable. :-) They offer five dollar cocktails every evening, and the one which I tried was delicious.",122,4
"Total Wine is a wine lover's heaven!! Since it was the Grand Opening, they had a few stations of wine tastings! At the door, a worker was checking ID's and handing out glasses for those who wanted to wine taste. It was quite busy the afternoon we went. \n\nThey had a few stations that had wine tastings of different types. White, Red, French, Napa wines. They also had smirnoff malt drinks, tanqueray, and MGD samples as well. They were giving away some freebies like drink shakers, mints, and a lime squeezer.\n\nMost of the workers who were giving out the wine were very informative and helpful. They'd explain the different wines, their age, description, etc.\n\nI love how organized and easy to find things are at Total Wine. They are organized by types of wine. Not like Lee's where you could be going up and down every aisle not really able to find what you are looking for because they are organized by location the wine is from.\n\nThere were complimentary magazines on wines. I took one and it is a pretty fat magazine all about wines. \n\nThey also have hard liquor, all types of beers, sake, etc etc. They sell beer by the bottle as well and you are able to make your own 6-pack. Pretty cool since you could get six different types that your heart desires. They even sell chips, olives, caviar, nuts, etc. Things you can find as a grocery store for a little cheaper but cool that they have it. \n\nI love Total Wine and glad they opened one in Henderson. I will have to check the one in Boca Park on the west side next time I am on that side.",372,4

"My parents were visiting and I decided to take them to Fez.  The food was good but the service was terrible.  It took them 15 minutes to even notice that we arrived and were waiting to be seated even though there were tons of staff about.  The waitress rarely checked on us, never refilled the water carafe, and then proceeded to misplace my dad's debit card.  Most of the staff ignored us since we weren't their table and those we did interact with weren't very friendly.  My parents said that this experience would keep them from eating here again and I have to say I feel the same way.  It is unfortunate since the food was spot on.",145,1

"came with a party of 7... place wasn't busy, but there was a sort of long wait for food. Decent portions, but a bit oily.  the flavors were good, but i think they used garlic granules on the garlic naan (bummer).  the okra had some woody bits and i think it was from frozen... not a dealbreaker, as i personally find dealing with fresh okra to be a bitch.  pretty good, but not quite as good as taste of India in Seattle.",105,2
"If there were negative stars I would have done that.\n\nLet me first say that we have been here many times and I have even reserved the back room for my wife's birthday. The food has always been decent and service good, but tonight was a completely different experience.\n\nWe arrived at 6:30 and the place looked busy, but not so busy and we were able to be seated right away. We placed our orders and then we waited...and waited...and waited. an hour later our server came back and let us know that our food would be out \""soon\"". We had our baby with us so at that point we just wanted to get our food and take it to go. But then he disappeared for another 20 minutes and we still had no food. We saw food come out and other tables (that had arrived after us) were being served, but none of our food had come out.\n\nWhen we finally got our food the order was incomplete. I got my food, which I went about boxing so that we could get going (home), but my wife's meal was MIA. I asked for our portion of the check and we waited some more. Another 20 minutes past and my wife's meal finally came, but was incorrect. She ordered corn tortillas and got flour; she has a gluten allergy and I explained that to the server, but he was unapologetic and stated \""if she doesn't have celiacs disease then she can just push the food off the wheat tortilla\"". I told him we won't be doing that and asked him to take the dish back and have it changed to corn. There was further discussion about how \""it was fine\"" and that \""I should just take the food\""...he finally reluctantly took the food back. We waited some more.\n\nAt this point my wife and I had had it and we just wanted to leave (without the food) I asked for my credit card back at the front desk (our server had once again disappeared) but the server had the card still. When I finally saw him, he said the food was on it's way. I told him we wanted none of it and we just wanted my card back so that we could go home. I asked if he had charged the card and he said \""no\"".\n\nWhen I got home, low and behold there was a hold charge for la Casa Blanca.\n\nNeedless to say we will never be back. I'm not sure what happened to this place, but no one apologized once, not even the manager.\n\nMy advice, avoid like the plague, especially on busy nights.",559,0

"It takes alot for me to frequent a restaurant numerous times, I believe that there are great places all over the city so why not take the time to try out new places. But LoLo's seems to be my cyptonite.

The fried chicken is great, and the waffles are amazing. Red beans and rice, grits, and red velvet cake are great too. Still not satisfied...LoLo's has red kool-aid, not the kind mom made, but the kind you always wanted to make as a kid, remember, half sugar half water and a packet of kool-aid, served in a mason jar. How can you go wrong. Ch..Ch..Ch..Check it Out.",185,4
"A clean establishment. Food seems to be on the healthier side. A little spendy but not outrageous. I went for lunch and ordered the turkey burger wrapped in lettuce with a side of regular fries. I haven't had many turkeys burgers so I don't have much to compare to, but it was juicy and pretty tasty. The fries are skinny just like I like but they were pretty cold when served. I went back a second time and ordered the same thing and the fries weren't as cold but still not as hot as I'd like. The meal was a little over $9 and I felt satisfied when I left.",130,2
"I don't understand all the hype I have heard about this place. It is only that. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was bland and dry, and the leeks on top made the whole dish have an onion taste. The waffles tasted completely like bacon, and there wasn't enough syrup. The entire dish was dry. I also couldn't decide how to tackle it. It was a really tall stack of waffles and chicken. I ordered a child sized pancake for my toddler, and it was the size of a small table. The portions are huge and I feel like its a waste of food. Also, I hated the atmosphere. The music was so loud that I couldn't talk to my family members that I had gone out to breakfast with unless I was yelling, and then they had to yell back. The service was pretty slow too, and not the greatest. Finally, the food that didn't live up to the hype was overpriced. I had been looking forward to trying out Has House A Go Go for quite some time and I was thoroughly disappointed.",221,1
I used to go for happer hour a lot.  They have great deals and the food is high quality compared to other happy hour bar food.  Staff was always nice.

We were lucky enough to have chef/owner Johnny Chu stop by our table probably three times just to chat and see what we liked and what we didn't. A great experience overall!",111,4
"My rating for this place is more like a 3.75-4, but because of service I rate it a 3. \nWe were there on a Thursday night and the place was pretty full. That being said we waited quite some time before the one guy serving/bartending was able to get to us. I will credit him for doing the best job possible! He maintained a helpful and friendly attitude despite how busy he was! \nNow onto the food....\nI absolutely LOVE Jamaican food and this place will be a go to when I get a craving.\n\nI had the combo jerk chicken and goat curry with rice and beans and veggies. The chicken and goat were both full of flavor with a little spice (I think it could use more). They provide you a side of BBQ/jerk sauce on the side that I think is nice, but the chicken doesn't need it. Writing this review is making me want to go there now! \nMy husband had the ackee and saltfish with festivals, rice and beans. \nAckee is a native fruit but does not taste fruity! To me it has a texture similar to egg (creamy spongy). \nThe dish was good, but we both felt it could use a little more of the salted cod for the price. \nThe festivals were perfectly fried, cripsy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Festivals are fried little dumplings that are great for sopping up the extra sauce left on your plate!\n\nIf you order the right thing Ocean Blue definitely delivers!

"Meh.\n\nI was at Office Max and needed a pick-me-up, and this place is right next door, within The Great Indoors. Convenience is a plus.\n\nI was wavering on how many stars to give this one. I'm not a fan of the superautomatic machines, and I wasn't real impressed by the coffee itself, so I was thinking 1 or 2 stars for that...but, on the other hand, for what it is, it's decent. Pretty comparable to Starbucks, really, but kinda lacking the burnt taste that sbux espresso has, so that's nice. Don't get me wrong--I will always have a special place in my heart for the siren; after all, I gave her five years of my life (and experienced the dreaded machine change-over), and I loved most of my time there, but, like I said, I'm just not a fan of the superautomatics.\n\nThe latte did the trick and satisfied my coffee-drink craving, so I can't knock that, but it just tasted weak to me and didn't knock my socks off or anything (I got my typical iced latte and took home some honey to drizzle over it).The taste itself was not bad, just weak. I expect 'weak' when I get an automatic latte, though.\n\nThe service was fine. I was the only customer at that moment, and I was greeted right away before I got to the counter. They were kind enough to offer to put the honey in for me, although I just took the packets home with me. Service is a plus.\n\nAll-in-all, it's not a bad place, and they had a few cute retail items from what I could see. If I'm at Office Max and need a coffee really really badly *right now,* I might go again, but I don't think there'll be a need for it. If I need some coffee, and I didn't bring my own from home or I'm not close enough to a stand-alone shop that I favor, then I'll stick with Starbucks, for nostalgia's sake :)",460,2

Food has been consistently good.\n\nThe main draw for me is the beer selection.  The fact they one most arrogant bar in America was a great accomplishment and the party with Stone was great. \n\nI just wish they would put their beer lists on the menu and make sure the waitresses are *somewhat* knowledgeable about the beer selections.  This past weekend I went and the featured Great Lakes Brewery beers were described as \""golden\"" and \""dark\"".

I really, really wanted it to be awesome after seeing all the other reviews for the other locations.\n\nTo be fair however, I bought my sandwich (Beach Club) at about 5pm, stuck it in the fridge as wrapped, and ate it about 3 hours later after the gym. The bread was incredibly stale/hard in some places and the only thing that I could really taste was the mayo. The avocado spread was visible but flavorless, as were the turkey and rest of the filling.\n\nHowever, I got the Vito for my son who ate it within 30 minutes of bringing it home and he said he enjoyed it and that the bread was fine.  Perhaps these are just the kind of sandwich you have to eat immediately?\n\nGuess I'll need to give ol' JJ another chance but for now it's two stars. Yes, they did make them super fast--but probably too fast that they failed to recognize that one of the rolls was stale. Boo.",232,1

I did my research on the internet prior to visiting and they definitely had competitive pricing. I'll buy my tires here anytime over buying online because the installation is free and the staff always treats me with respect.

Most all meats seemed a bit mushy and ALL of the dishes (except the hot pot and octopus) had a cloying undertone of sweet.  Kung Pao Brisket with no pow, hot pot seafood where the hot was all of the chili variety.

"If it weren't for the fact that my Partner In Cuisine and I can walk to the Union Grill whenever we want, we'd probably never go there.  The food and service are pretty decent, but they aren't really anything you can't find anywhere else.  Between the two of us, we have pretty much tried everything on the menu and nothing really sticks out as being superlative (except maybe the waffle fries).  The old stand-bys are the fish sandwich, the French dip and the salmon salad.\n\nDuring the warm weather the Union Grill offers a lovely opportunity for al fresco dining on Craig Street.  Unfortunately, because of the lax smoking rules in Pittsburgh, there's always someone standing 5 feet from you smoking a cigarette.  Because of that, we sadly always have to eat inside. \n\nI do like if you order a soda, that you get it in a gigantic glass - this avoids the need for your server to keep running back and forth, refiling pop.  Their alcoholic drinks are somewhat more expensive than the other bars in Oakland, so between that and the fact the place closes so damn early (I think 10 during the Summer), the PIC and I rarely go there unless we are too hungry or lazy to think of anywhere else go.",269,2

"Really hits the spot when you're craving good Chinese food away from home... They just lose a star because they're pretty expensive when factoring it all in! (I know I know, it's all expensive now on the Strip, but seriously... $18 for chow mein... $24 for kungpao shrimp... $21 for hainan chicken?) But in my eyes, for anyone to grab five stars their food has to be exemplary and/or at a great price for what you get... Don't get that here, but don't get me wrong; I dine here at least once each time I get to Vegas. It's my go-to when I need my Chinese fix. At least they don't charge for hot tea (like that Chinese place in the MGM does....) They're not WAY overpriced for what you get, and the price won't stop me from getting my hainan and pei dan jook.\n\nOh, and a last note, I don't know what that person is saying about how they wish it was more authentic......

One word: Breathtaking,6,4
"Briefly:\n- Not fancy, but certainly decent enough\n- GREAT location (near metro stop, walkable to grocery stores and other things)\n- Excellent staff\n\nI would stay here again, if I was by myself (I'm not sure my girlfriend would cotton to it).  I know, giving it three stars make it seem like a bad review, but it's not  - this is a very solid three star place.  It's not fancy - in fact, the rooms are a bit-run down - but they're clean enough, and the bed is fine, and the shower works - what do you want from a cheap hotel?\n\nOn top of which, the staff is GREAT.  When I checked in there was a problem with the Expedia-made reservation; the guy at the desk called Expedia, worked it out, and upgraded my room.  When I was checking out, at an unholy 3:30 am, the (different) guy at the desk called a taxi at 3am to make sure one would be there on time, called again at 3:30 to make sure it was on it's way, and generally treated me great.\n\nPlus, it's just a block and a half from a metro stop on the coveted green line, and there are grocery stores and two indoor malls within a couple of blocks walking distance, so you can easily shop to fill the pantry in each room.\n\nOh, and the rooms are solid, with thick walls - there was a large Inuit (or first nations, if you prefer) family with a bunch of kids staying in the room right next to mine, and I never heard them through the walls.",362,2
"Great spot to find all kinds of unique items...gag gifts, party favors, souvenirs, gadgets, widgets, jewelry, etc. I had to walk through twice and take everything in. The guy manning the store was very pleasant and pointed out things I may had missed. There's items available from local artists, which I thought was nice. Go on in and take a peek! :-)",80,3
I took my husband here for breakfast for his birthday. It was very good! I had the huevos rancheros and the green chile pork was delicious! The rest of it was good too. My husband had bacon and eggs and he said it was good. The staff was friendly and we were served quickly. We'll definitely go again,68,3
"We came here tonight because we had heard such great things about the food and environment, and based on our experience we were able to see why. Immediately upon sitting at the bar our bartender served us, which was nice.  Having just had dinner, we weren't too hungry but decided to try the Creamed Corn followed by the  Warm Butter Cake. A very polite server brought us our corn in minutes. The corn was excellent! It was sweet, but not too sweet.\n\nFinally it came time for dessert. The famous Warm Butter Cake! The cake was topped with ice cream, strawberries and oranges paired with the biggest bowl of whipped cream I've ever seen. This dessert is to die for! It was warm, moist, cold and so good that we honestly felt like we were in heaven. It was definitely worth making the trip for.\n\nA glass of champagne, a side, and dessert came out to about ~$30. Service was  excellent! I'll definitely have to come back here on an empty stomach one day to try their full menu because the food that kept passing under our noses looked amazing!",232,4
"I came to Mikey's after reading all the good reviews but was left highly disappointed. I ordered the lunch special with steamed rice, sesame chicken and mixed vegetables from the steam table. First of all, workers are inattentive. they pester you to choose the items abruptly, yet forget which items you chose. Secondly, my meal was literally rice, 10 tiny pieces of chicken the size of thumbnail, 4 pieces of overcooked broccoli, 1 carrot and small pieces of cabbage. Thirdly, the oil used to fry the chicken had probably not been changed for 3 years as the chicken left a bitter aftertaste on my tongue. From the price point of $7.25 after tax, the meal left me unsatisfied and was highly overpriced for the quality and quantity. I suggest you to try your luck at other chinese restaurants in the plaza.",175,0
Friendly service and great food. Just like Detroit Coney. Love that you guys sell Faygo Rock n' Rye. We will definitely be back soon.,31,4
Had breakfast here the other Sunday morning and the food was amazing. Great flavors and a fantastic variety for carnivores. If you are in the mood for some comfort food and have a few calories to spare this place is great. We also had a little breakfast/dessert the banana bread french toast was really good. It was a little small and the coffee bar set up is kinda weird even still amongst all the good places to have breakfast these guys still stand out.,93,3
Just enjoyed a wonderful dinner this evening. The Salmon over fresh vegetables and linguini along with a glass of wine was a great way to end the work day.,33,4
"I should have know the moment I saw the logo but I have a fondness for bats.  I definitely should have known when I walked in the front door and saw the fake water feature straight out of a lame local amusement park.\n\nMy girlfriend is a vegertarian and it's a one-star kind of place for being so unfriendly toward veggies but the menu was uninspired and the decor was mind blowing in a bad way.  We ordered two beers, judged a bit (the folks seemed very nice and the food might be ok), and left as it's not was the reviews led me to believe.\n\nIt's a chain waiting to happen in a town with plenty of good local and authentic food options; we were absolutely thrilled with our 2nd choice of Los Sombreros - 5-stars!",173,0
"Came back with my girlfriend. \n\nOrdered the chicken cordon bleu and it was tasty :) The brie cheese isn't that strong though. It sort of melts and mixes with the juices of the chicken. Much better portion size than the sandwich before and more variety in the flavors. This was a much higher quality dish.\n\nThe mashed potatoes were very good. We also tried the crab cake which had a sweet salsa and some sort of caviar on top as well as a side salad. Pretty tasty! \n\nMy girlfriend had a pita wrap which was the right size for the price. The pita fell apart really easily though.\n\nStill sort of pricey but I guess it's reasonable for the uniqueness of the food. \n\nFood took a long time, but it helps playing with the games to pass the time. I suggest planning a lot of time to eat here, or calling in your order ahead of time.\n\nI'd come back if I needed a change of pace, but not sure I'd ever crave a place like this.",224,3
"This was a nightmare ! Accused to be a thief in a restaurant for not leaving traditional 15% tip for services I was totally dissatisfied with !?\n\nI went for dinner on a Monday. We were so hungry we would have eaten even on the side walk. We brought our favorite wine and with a super good mood we stepped in L'Academie St Denis.\n\nWe ordered one of the specials (mussels) and duck (which is actually one of their top offers). The service was incredibly slow! I had to ask 2 times to have my bottle of wince opened. In the end another waiter showed up to fill with water and, after he did his job, he returned to open the bottle. As it was a white wine I asked for a cooler with it, which came after another good waiting time (we were half way through our bottle). We ordered out choices and he didn't mentioned to us that the special comes with a soup or a salad. I had to call him again to tell him what I just found out from the next table and order the soup. It looks like eating in a place where tabled are jammed pack one next to the other is a good thing after all. \n\nThe food was ready in a decent time (or maybe it was just the wine to make the wait look short). The soup was good, mussels were very good (but I noticed they reduced the portions comparing with before), the duck was average with canned-like sauce.\n\nSo much sauce, so much grease ... I asked for more bread. It seemed to us we could have jumped naked on a table not to catch the attention of our waiter. Another waiter came with the bread.\n\nWe were so not happy with the service. Everything I asked was like a battle: had to literally wave to catch his attention, every time he came with something he was throwing them on the table. He looked like if I were to bother him more he would spit on food before bringing in.\nAnyway, we made it through and we asked for the bill right away, no desert as we had too much (too much of a bad service).\n\nSo now the nightmare part! We decided to leave him exactly 10% of the price before taxes. This would have been an alarm bell to struggle to provide a better service next time. It seems like he didn't need any bell. He didn't pick the paper slip from the table but he put his finger on it to point to the tip! And then he explained me what the price is, where the taxes are, where the total is and where the tip line is. I told him I knew all that and that is all for his services. \n\nHe  actually had the guts to bargain with me: \""What, that's it!? For the whole night!? You asked me to bring you that, open you that, more that...and that's it!?\"" So I told him \""You know, guess what? Now that you mentioned it ....\"" and I took the slip back from him to adjust the tip. He literally pulled out the paper slip from my hand and started to scream (yes to scream): \""You know how this is called? This is stealing!\"" I said \""That's it! I want to talk with you manager!\"" Of course he left and never called the manager but just continue with the other tables. I asked another 2 waiters until the manager actually was told to come at out table. I asked him to bring back my slip where I adjusted the tip to zero. I explained him the situation and left the decision to him.\n\nAccused to be a thief in a restaurant for not leaving traditional 15% tip for services I was totally dissatisfied with!?",788,0
Conceptually this place is great. We were there on the soft open and walking into the interior transports you to a different place.  It's pretty well planned space - although with the heat I can see the play structure becoming a problem in the summer.  A few more decent shops and I can see this place being very popular. I like the concept of having a few of them be pop-up shops although I agree with one of the other reviewers in that a few of the shops seem to be lacking in real products.,109,3

"Never again! I enjoy Fatburger as a chain but the one on the strip (not so much) as it does not have the same values as the ones in LA. The customer service is horrible and the wait time is unrealistic. The burger was not good, the credit card machine didn't work and the food again taste more like they cooked it and had it waiting for prep only. My review is only based on this one location in Vegas not the chain, I am a Raving Fan and will contine to enjoy Fat Burgers in LA.",112,0
"Bank of America  ah yes the power of Ken Lewis squirming his way out of insider trading while he buys $100++ trash cans for his office and lays people off . Go figure ... screw the little guy. My trouble with B of A started I guess about well maybe 4 months ago . I decided on a Disney vacation and went on their web site ( Disney ) and booked everything with my Visa check card that is supposed to have fraud protection well it seems that the call center that Disney was using for these transactions had a team of scum bags that stole peoples credit card #s . Ok so I normally check my balance about every day or so anyway I checked it must have been 3 days after I booked and I had 3 charges one for nearly $10,000 another for about $12,000 then another for about $25,000 not only that everything that I charged bounced and there where about I guess $400 more dollars . \n       I called the bank two where used for cars and one for someones cruise  vacation I said wait a minute did it not raise a flag when a $25,000 purchase came threw  when I mostly just use it max of $1000. Well there must have been a \""bank error \"" they said. You damm right there was !!\n       Anyway the bank did put, the money back except and this is the shi..ty part they said I would have to pay the returned fees from the charges that I made and there was no money ?

"11/28/14: PLEASE let me save you from coming here!--TOURIST TRAP of the worst kind!  D\u00e9cor is very trendy and artistic.  Looks beautiful in a dark and mysterious way.  Well, the parts you can see anyway cause this is probably one of the darkest lit restaurants I have ever been to.  Tip: Use the flash on your phone to read the menu.  Well, as I was saying, it looks and feels like a heavily themed Disneyland ride, though a beautiful one,... and that's what you get with the food too: described to be luxurious on the menu with prices to reinforce, but served up cardboard.\n\n1. Moscow Mule $18: Says on the menu it's made up of vodka, lime, and ginger beer... and whadya know... it tastes just like that.  Yes, that's right, go home and mix your own vodka, lime, and beer and you got the same dang thing.  ZERO complexity.  Tastes fine as a girly drink--but you don't pay $18 for a cocktail you drink at your cheap company's holiday bash.  1/10.\n\n2. Salmon Pizza $21: Crap.  Utter crap.  I don't care if it has little tiny dabs of caviar and is covered in salmon.  The bread is a tasteless piece of cardboard, and this dish is hardly deserving of your hard-earned money.  1/10.\n\n3. Bone-In Ribeye Tomahawk $58: Straight up LIE.  It says \""24 Ounce, 2 Signature Sauces\"" as a description.  Look... I've had honest 18oz steaks that I could barely finish, ...this is NOT 24oz.  I wolfed it cause it tastes good, but was still plenty hungry.  Note that this steak is extremely marinated--like it's completely saturated with some kind of marinade which really covers up the natural meat taste.  Yeah, I'd say it tastes good, but for $58, you don't pay for a plate of marinade.  $58 will buy you an amazing steak at Mastro's or Alexander's... this place has no right to serve this crap at that price.  3/10.\n\n4. Bread Pudding $9: OMG, one sanely priced item.  Too bad it doesn't taste that great.  Your local diner will probably serve better.  Well on that note, there is one curiosity--do I spy Captain Crunch Cereal covering the dish!?!?  (See my pictures!--seriously.) I don't get it.  I mean, did they attempt to try to make Captain Crunch in-house?--or is that really the stuff you buy at the super market?  Well, if they made it, it sure tastes like Captain Crunch.  Would an ultra-high-end fancy-pants I-got-$300-caviar restaurant dare put Captain Crunch on a dessert???  Sigh... 4/10.\n\nIf you think I'm just joking around and you think the current 4-stars it has on Yelp could be correct... go right ahead.  Just promise me you'll get the bread pudding and ask for some milk--tell the waiter that you will need it to go with your cereal.\n\n1/5.\n\n#Russian #vegas #overpriced #avoid #touristtrap",749,0
"After reading a lot of great reviews and seeing check-in after check-in by my friends, I decided to check this place out. I probably would've checked it out a lot sooner had it not been for the fact that it's kind of out of the way from my house, but better late than never! I came here with my parents and ordered the Furikake Bento and the Mochiko Bento. I was first surprised by the inexpensiveness of their bentos (8.95) and the variety of the items included in each. When our order arrived, I was again pleasantly surprised by the amount of food! Their portions are pretty big! \n\nBeing that it was my first time, I didn't stray too far with the substitution options they had. While the substitutions have an additional price, (i.e. kimchi fried rice, macaroni salad) it is good to note that they have options--Especially for the health conscious individuals. \n\nOne downside I did find was that I left the place smelling of food. While I'm sure it is hard to ventilate a small place with an open kitchen that prepares their food the way they do, you might not want to dine in unless you plan for others to smell everything you ate on your clothes. Thank goodness for TO-GO!",276,3

"Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the prices are outrageous for what you're getting  and it isn't exactly what I would call Mexican food. It's just too expensive to eat here especially considering that the taco salad is the best thing on the menu but its not really something that would make a good leftover. The decor is cute, and it's a fun atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the drink choices are excellent, but until they're going to either turn it into a nicer restaurant or lower the prices a bit, I'll just stick to a different restaurant.",127,2

"I was looking for a change of pace from the typical Strip hotel coffee shop menu.  I was craving some italian and Bootlegger was reccommended to me.  The restaurant is located south of the Strip, about 10 minutes drive south of Mandalay Bay.  \n\nOrdered lasagna and  minestrone soup.  Also got some comlimentary garlic rolls that were pretty decent. The soup and lasagna were merely okay, not really stand-outish.  Filled me up but nothing special.\n\nOverall, I would say that Bootlegger is an okay italian place that's open 24/7 if you're craving a late nite fix, but not really a destination place.",150,2
"I went to this place on the recommendation of a friend, and was not disappointed.  The sign reads \""Mexican inspired cuisine\"" and, looking at the menu, the description seems to show in the form of a list of specialty items that are fusion dishes.  They do have more traditional Mexican dishes as well.\n\nI can't personally speak to the quality of the fusion dishes, but the more traditional fare is quite good.  The service is excellent as well.  I'll definitely come back there when I'm in town again.",114,3

"Really weird - I've been to this place two times.  On both occasions, the food was amazing.  Really good top to bottom (this last time we ordered the veggie app, chicken korma, and the lamb with spinach -oh, can't forget the garlic naan).  The waitress was genuinely sweet, but a tad slow.  Most likely because she had too many tables.  \n\nMy beef, again, is with the hostess stand.  I've now commented on this twice and I see at least one more review with similar feedback.  This visit, the hostess seemed frustrated at our arrival.  I walked up to the desk and said \""Hello, I'm Zach, we have a reservation for 2 at 6:30\"" to which the hostess replied while rolling her eyes \""Everyone has a reservation tonight.  Please follow me.\""  So not only was it an inappropriate comment, if I could fully interpret what she meant, but she proceeded to sit us at a table that had yet to be cleared and seemed bitter the entire time. \n\nProvide some customer service training to the hostess staff and I'll most likely give this place 5 stars.",251,3
"This bar pretty much sums up everything that annoys me about the Theatre in one go. It's a bit gaudy looking, it's painted stupidly flambuoyant colours and the shakespearean life-sized figureheads suspended above the door are just a little too desperate and attention-seeking for my liking. And on the one occasion I drank here it was full of people that pretty much matched that description too.\n\nYes, it's a really convenient location if you want a few drinks before you see a show, as it's pretty much inside the Playhouse building. But that fact also means that drinks are really overpriced. Obviously the other reviewers liked it considerably more than I did, but I have to say I am definitely not a fan.",155,1
"The good:\nWe got here around 3 pm, and the service was fast. Also, I tried some of my friends miso soup which was pretty good.

Yes, our server brought our drinks and food quickly, but I felt really rushed since she came twice to take our order after bringing our drinks, so I had to order what my friend recommended, soft noodles with chicken, pork and sea food.\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe noodles were terrible. But maybe that's just my opinion since my friend did liked them. They are really greasy. I agree with the previous review saying that they might cook with msg. I could not finish my food so I had to take it to my room which is probably gonna end up in the trash anyways.",204,1
"We purchased 3 days stay at the Riveriera Hotel in Las Vegas. We checked in at the self-check in kiosk, however they checked us in a different party's reservation and charged is for $100 hold and resort fees. We went to the room assigned and the room was not made. The bed was still used and dirty towels were on the floor. We went back down to the hotel registration and they informed us of the incorrect registration error and said that my card was now charged for our resort fees and that we will be credited for the other party's fees once they check out. When looking at the receipt, it showed my name with a different credit card number. I told them that it was incorrect and they was insisting that was the card given when booked with Bookit.com. It was past 12am and everyone was tired so we just got our new keys and went to our room. When finally settling in, I pull the blankets to climb into be and see white sheets with dirt on them.

"I came into this restaurant for the first time on a whim as I was passing by to originally eat at \""Mr. Tofu\"" but was not disappointed by my abrupt change of plan. The restaurant itself was very spacious so there is more than enough room to accommodate for a large number of people. At first impression, the place has a nice modern/hip atmosphere to it, which is nice for those looking for a casual outing with some friends or family. I have eaten at numerous sushi spots in town so I was excited to see how this would measure.\n\nI came with my 63 year old mother and we OWNED the AYCE menu. At $25.95 a head, we definitely ate our monies worth. To be honest, I would have rated the food at 3 stars had it not been for the fantastic service from the waiters/waitresses. My waiter was Pat, who was extremely helpful, patient, and friendly. \n\nThe food itself was very mixed. Some things were good and some were bad. For me this is a list of some of the food I thought tasted good or bad:\n\nGood:\n-Soft Shell Crab Tempura\n-Dragon Roll\n-Rock n Roll \n-Salmon Sashimi\n-Tuna Sashimi\n-Yellowtail Nigiri\n-Salmon Nigiri (although the cuts were thin and small with a lot of rice)\n\nBad:\n-Uni (Sea Urchin) Nigiri - TERRIBLE. I've head plenty of sea urchin before but this was NOT FRESH at all. It came to me slimy and it tasted like plastic, SHITTY PLASTIC. \n-Mackerel Nigiri - Dry\n-Beef Tongue Skewer - Disappointed in the taste.\n\nAgain, it was very mixed, but try what you can as your palate may differ from mine. Overall, I would not mind visiting again. It may not be as highly ranked as my usual sushi spots (Oyshi or Goyemon), but it does a good job.",428,3

A bit of a line for the omelets, and I didn't want to wait, but my friends said they were good.  I had Eggs Benedict from the buffet... not good because none of it was hot or even warm.  It's my favorite dish and I should know better than to get it at a buffet.  I liked the pastries and the coffee was good.

But with that being said... on the menu it reads that should you request extra bread it will cost you $3.00 because the supplier is charging more. $3.00?! I better get more than just one extra basket! \n\nReading many reviews and being a big fan of Novecento, this was disappointing. The service lacked incredibly!! No smile, no introduction, no recommendations!! For my first time and with all these reviews you would think they'd have some pride to talk to you about the place and the must haves.\n\nWe started with the Parma salad... WEAK! It was absolutely boring and I tasted more olive juice than an actual dressing. Next we had the Greens Juliana it was so salty, that the Parma salad could've used some of that! For entree's we ordered Chicken Parmesan- Overcooked and boring, that dish came out and I stared and said wow.. that looks pathetic. I took a bite of the side pasta... the most overcooked noodles you could get with what canned tomato sauce?! Add some basil or something to bump it up! If I need to put salt on pasta... WHAT?! Mind blown. I ordered the Mushroom Parpadelle- bland bland oh did I mention bland? With pieces of I believe pancetta it could save this dish but no.. It fails. It was almost as if they just cooked some mushrooms and dumped it on the noodles without really creating a \""sauce.\"" \n\nMy moms been talking about going here for months.. Looks like I won't be returning or taking her.",349,1

"I don't think I could of had a better experience at this little cafe.  I did circle around the building a few times before realizing it was in the building, but I'd circle around 10 more times so long as it meant eating the chicken salad sandwich I had.  The staff was super friendly, with a face like the one that greeted me how could you not leave a place happier walking out than when you walked in?  \n\n10/10, that was the best chicken salad sandwich I have ever had.  \nThe menu states that there are apples in there, but do not let that steer you away from this sandwich if you are the kind of person that does not like fruit with your chicken.  Because, let me tell you, they make apples and chicken go together like peanut butter and jelly.",176,4
"growing up I had a one barber who knew me for many years and being new to Las Vegas I was looking for a similar situation where I can say \""I have a barber that I go to\""  after reading the reviews I decided to check them out.  was greeted at the door! there was a considerable wait time as they were busy.  I enjoyed the wait however, watching them work and seeing what they can do, the conversations were hilarious.  I had a feeling of male bonding akin to my childhood experiences.   I was not sure what kind of haircut i wanted and simply told them what I was thinking and they hooked me up with a fresh cut, and cleaned me up with hot lather and straight razor shave.  Cash only!  I will be returning for my future haircuts.",163,4

"Eh...it was OK. Brought my sons caregiver, my son (13) and myself...it was 58$!!! holy hella expensive!! My child has autism, so I wasn't sure what to expect from him with all the butterflies flapping about. We first saw the movie, which is good if you like 3-D stuff...but for me it just made me nauseated and gave me a bit of a headache. My son was NOT thrilled with the butterflies, and was shooing them away from him and trying to shoo them away with his foot too, so one of the workers got all in a tizzy about this...as if he was going to go kill the butterflies  or something...sheesh!!  While I was there I saw 4 people step on butterflies, and my son didn't even so much as graze against one....the guy clearly didn't understand the disability, or was just an ass...:(( the sting ray thing was ok as well, but not overly exciting...my son did seem to like that, but likely because he liked the fish in the tank, and water in general. Over all it was just Meh.....overpriced....WAY overpriced...I went, I saw....and now I don't think I will go again.....not until the other stuff is done in 2 years. This  is just MY experience...I'm sure others enjoyed it, but I didn't.",299,1

"Everyone that knows me knows that I have the maddest crush ever on Chef Hubert Keller after watching him on Top Chef Masters.  So when I found out I was going to Vegas for a convention I made reservations oh about 2 months in advance for an early birthday celebration.\n\nMyself and three of my girls showed up for our 730pm reservation and headed to the lounge to wait and order a martini that had Pop Rocks in it as the onlne menu suggested.  Alas, they don't make it anymore which resulted in four ladies saying \""Awwwww!\"" in unison.  But we were seated before even ordering a drink so we didn't have time to be uber-disapponted.\n\nWe were seated in the back of the restaurant in a private cabana (although the curtains were not shut).  The restaurant was dimly lit with light Europop music in the background and my first impression was ooooh fancy!  I loved the atmosphere.  On the wall there is also a live flower arrangement made with 3500 individual roses with their own individual water receptacles attached to them.  They replace them every day too...aaaah Chef Keller, so niiiice!\n\nOn to the food.  I chose the Elegance menu since you cannot do the Chef's tasting menu unless the entire table does it.  Another friend did the Elegance menu, the other the Lion King three course menu, and the other the vegetarian menu.  We had an amuse bouche to start and it was some sort of fried cod and it was tasty - my friends and I both liked it.  They brought out a separate amuse bouche for the vegetarian friend as well which I thought was a nice touch.  The bread basket was also brought around and I got the foccacia which was so delicious they had to bring the bread basket around again 5 minutes later because we needed more.\n\nFirst course I had the truffled onion soup with braised duck ragout and truffles.  They bring the bowl out with items placed in the bottom and then the soup is poured on top.  That was some seriously wonderful, creamy onion soup.  I ate every last bit of it and considered sopping up the rest with my bread...or licking it clean with my tongue.\n\nSecond course I chose the veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli with a veal jus sauce.  I thought the ravioli was tasty but I would say perhaps the sauce was a bit too salty but not too salty to eat every last bit of it.\n\nThird course I chose the filet mignon with potato puree, spinach, and wild mushrooms.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and the sauce was divine.  The potato puree looked very festive on the plate - like a potato comma at the top - and tasted as good as it looked.\n\nThe last course was dessert which we had to order when we ordered our entrees.  I got the chocolate souffle ($6 supplement) and it was worth the entire trip to Vegas just to eat this.  It comes out looking absolutely perfect and a fleur de lys design is on top in powdered sugar.  The waiters poke a hole in the top and pour the chocolate sauce in.  Then you devour it and the mocha ice cream they served with it while your eyes roll back in your head and you think \""Oh sweet baby Jesus, thank you for this excellent dessert!\""\n\nAs an added bonus the waiter brought out a special birthday dessert for me - I don't even know what it was but they had written Happy Birthday on the plate in chocolate syrup which pleased me to no end.  The manager came around to ask how our evening was and I did have to ask if Chef Keller was there....and...he....wasn't.  Damn - minus one star for the lack of superstar chef meeting!  I didn't get my chance to meet him this time, but I'll definitely stalk him down next trip. hehe\n\nThroughout the dinner the service was excellent.  Our waiter was friendly, funny, and he kept our cocktails filled (Fleurtini if you must know).  Only misstep was perhaps the long lag time between the 2nd and 3rd courses.  Not a big deal since we were just hanging out.\n\nAt the end of dinner they bring the ladies a rose from the aforementioned flower art on the wall.  This is meant to win you over after you see how much your dinner was.  HA!  Overall I thought it was worth the money and they only way it could have been better was to get to meet my fave celebrity Chef.",961,3

"This is my favorite brunch spot in Charlotte! The cornbread and apple butter are a welcomed starter and they have the best fresh-tasting scrambled eggs.

"I just love it. It's a great place that makes you feel right at home. I hate going to gyms, actually I hate working out in front of anyone, but I feel so comfortable here that I don't worry about it. I know that they're just trying to get me to the fitness level that I want to achieve.\n\nRory, my one on one trainer, is amazing. He seems to know just how much he can push me and how much I can really do even though at times I don't even believe it. The boxing lessons are fun and I love the fact that I'm working out and learning something new. \n\nThe 30 minute workouts are just the right amount of time. The prices are fair and reasonable. The owner is just a delight and all the trainers are professional and great.\n\nGlove Game Boxing packs a lot of heat within it's wall. Go check it out when you get a chance. For only $20 you can get a trial session and that to me is a pretty sweet deal.",226,4
"I've been ordering from this place for a couple months and have always loved the food however the customer service is severely lacking. After tonight I will no longer be ordering from this restaurant. The person taking my order could not get it right, the delivery took a half hour longer than expected, our order was incorrect when we got it and when we called them to tell them what was missing and wrong they said they weren't sure if someone could bring the missing/incorrect items. They will not refund anything but they will give a credit which does nothing since I will not order from them again.",121,1

"Had been wanting to try this place for a while and after having read the reviews, I knew I had to.  \n\nMy best friend and I stopped by on a Sunday evening.  The place wasn't busy and there were plenty of servers available.  Which made me wonder why it took so long for us to have our drink orders taken (just an Iced tea and water).  This was only the beginning of the issue with the service...\n\nThey have a fairly large menu with a great selection of both Greek and Italian cuisines.  We started with the hummus and pita as an appetizer.  It was very good and you could tell the hummus was freshly made.  \n\nMy friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the Spaghetti Oglio with feta (I asked if they could add some artichoke hearts and they did with no extra charge).  My dish was very good.  The servings are perfect if you want leftovers for the next day.  My bestie also said that her meal was great and also had plenty for leftovers!  \n\nNow to the only qualms we had with the place.  Once we got our meal, our server only came by once to refill my iced tea.  Other than that...she was pretty much invisible.  The other 3 servers were constantly visible around the restaurant.  One guy even had a table of 10 that he was checking on periodically.  Finally, when we were ready for our check we had to ask another server to inform ours that we were ready for our check.  Again, the place wasn't that busy and we literally sat there waiting for our check for a good 10-15 minutes before we finally had to ask for our server.  \n\nI would have given this review 4 or 5 stars, but I feel I had to scale it down due to the service (which really only refers to our own server since the others seemed to be pretty much on the ball).  She was friendly...I will not take that away from her.  However, she could use a brush up on some customer service skills.  \n\nWe will be going back and would definitely recommend it to others, with hopes that the service is better.  \n\nI do look forward to trying the gyro as it looked delicious! \n\nP.S.  Whatever Italian dressing they use for the salad is perfect!",508,2
"Honestly, I'm not entitrely sure why all the hype about this place. People in Montreal have been going bananas over it since it opened a few years ago. \n\nIt's casual - you order at the counter, choose a booth, and when your food is done they yell out your name like there is no tomorrow and you pick it up. You choose a meat, a sauce, a side, and create your own customised plate.\n\nThe food was somewhat disappointing - We tried the BBQ chicken and the pulled pork sandwich. Both tasted much more like the sauce they were covered in than the smoky BBQishness I was after.",135,1
It was fine. The food was OK but I've certainly had better and fresher Thai food elsewhere. I would not go back.,28,1
"We ate here last night before a show at Crescent Ballroom. We arrived a bit before 7pm and were a party of 6. We weren't the largest party there and definitely got there before a couple of the larger parties. \n\nWe didn't get our food until a quarter after 8 after watching the larger parties that were seated after us receive thiers.  I asked our server to bring us some to go boxes when she brought the food out, as well as the check, as we didn't want to miss the show we planned to watch and we didn't receive it for another 15 minutes.  I'm tempted to say that our server didn't place our order immediately or was too occupied with the trainee that was following her around to notice that we were in a hurry, even after I asked for the check. \n\nThe food wasn't bad, but will likely never eat here again and just spend time at the Rum Bar.",206,1
"Continuing on the search to find a fabulous serving of pork lau lau, I was brought to Aloha Kitchen on S. Decatur Blvd.  Pulling into the lot, I recall seeing this place on yelp and was anxious to get my turn at it.  It's pretty crowded for a late Friday night and people are starting to pile in.\n\nWe join the line and perused the menu above.  The BF convinces me to go for the Hawaiian Plate at $8.99.  It's Kalua Pig and Pork Lau Lau, so this way he gets to try some of the kalua pig too!  This comes with two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad.  The BF ops for the Kalbi Combo at $7.99.  This give us Kalbi, Katsu, and Chicken Teriyaki.  It also comes with the standard two scoops of white rice and one scoop of mac salad.  \n\nI should mention, I've been to my share of Hawaiian joints, but my sister takes the cake.  She definitely makes it a point to try out any new ones that she comes across.  She also always substitutes the two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad for an additional scoop of mac and one less rice.  This is usually never a problem, and if anything, they might charge a bit more for the mac salad.  Well, I asked if I could do this.  The cashier had to ask another woman, and she in turn had to ask another guy (the manager/owner) I assume.  He flat out said no.  Wow.  They tried explaining something about not charging me for the rice, so they can't do that.  Anyway, I think I was just put off with the whole \""No.\"" answer.  They could have said yes and said they would charge me for the substitution, which I probably would have agreed to anyway.  \n\nWe got our number, helped ourselves to beverages and condiments and took a seat in a booth.  One of the servers soon headed our way with my order.  Just as she was about to place it on the table, all this liquid came spilling out onto the floor and table from the plate.  (Wtf?)  She apologized and went to retrieve a towel to clean up the mess.  I was fine with the spill and clean up, my concern was with where all the liquid came from?!  I guess my Pork Lau Lau must have come out a bath, because that was dripping wet.  I ended up  pouring all this additional liquid off my plate into another plate before my rice and mac salad got too soggy from all this 'juice' sitting on my dish.  I unraveled my lau lau in search of my pork and took my first bite.  For being soggy, the meat was rather tough and the whole dish had no taste.  I ended up pouring tons of shoyu all over the dish.  There was no fatty bits either to give it any flavor.  Very disappointing on the pork lau lau part.  The kalua pig faired a bit better, but not by much.  It started out well, but as I got deeper into it, there was a lot of tough pieces that I ended up spitting out.  Overall, my dish was pretty disappointing.  I wouldn't go back here for any pork lau lau at all.\n\nI was about halfway through my order before the BF's order finally arrived.  (This is never a good thing.)  His was better, in his opinion.  He had a decent experience with his order at least.  The Chicken Teriyaki had a sweeter sauce than what I'm used to, but that's probably why this dish does well here. \n\nThe mac salad was better than some of the other places I've been to, so that was a good thing.  \n\nThere's the Aloha Bar next door and there's karaoke on Friday nights.  You'll see the servers bringing orders in next door if you're dining in.  \n\nThey do offer delivery, it's a $10 minimum and if you get their flyer, you'll find a 15% coupon on there. I asked if they had any business cards, which they were out of.  When the cashier asked the manager/owner if he had any, he asked \""Why?\""  (Uh, 'cuz I'm going to yelp this place, that's why!)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Aloha Kitchen will continue to do well.  They are open later than some of the other Hawaiian establishments around town (5 am on Fridays and Saturdays I believe!) and they have a surplus of young customers coming in to chow down.  They have two other locations, one on E. Charleston and the other on S. Maryland Parkway.  I just know that if I return, I won't be getting any pork lau lau, that's for sure.",1050,1

"Quality of food is good overall, although nuking your food in the microwave is not unknown (\""We don't have an oven hot enough to heat it in less than 30 minutes\"") on a kasha knish.

I followed the server's recommendation of the beef Pho. Responding to her attempt to up-sell me from the basic bowl, I told her I did not like meatballs. I ended my order with veggie spring rolls.\n\nMy food came out quickly. It also came out wrong: veggie eggs rolls and beef Pho with meatballs. The busser appeared quickly and asked me if everything was okay. I told her about the mistakes, she apologized, but did not reappear, nor did my server. I figured they were busy and I didn't want to make a fuss. \n\nThis would not have been a problem. But, the eggs rolls were mushy and lacked flavor. Even this could have been saved by the Pho. I took out the meatballs and the Pho did taste good. It was definitely homemade, but the noodles were overcooked and broke apart on my chopsticks. There was also a grit at the bottom of my bowl. \n\nI don't doubt that the food is good. But, it seemed like they fell asleep on me. It was rather disappointing after the recommendation that brought me there.",276,1

Our server offered to switch out the lavish for fresh veggies with the hummus dip.  When the veggies arrived they smelled amazing.

We both opted for the salad with goat cheese and had asked for our dressing to be on the side but when the salads arrived, they were both dressed.

Once they get cold, eh not so much\n\nHomemade bbq chips - the chips were ok but the sauce, I could have dipped anything in that Jalapeno ranch sauce and it would have tasted good.

"I have been previously warned about the service at Aces & Ales being average. But I love trying new beers. We went after I bought a Groupon and so we went. The service was okay and the second shifts came in and were very friendly. We ordered, ate and drank for a good two hours. When it was time to leave, we gave our bartender a $20 for tip because to our surprise she was great. We paid and left. The next day I noticed a 20% tip added to my amount. I called to speak to a manager and ended speaking to the bartender from our visit. I asked if there was an automatic tip charge on each bill. She said no and I left a message for the manager. The next day the charge was corrected and I received a call from the manager. He explained that some backs automatically put a 20% charge on tickets. WTF! This guy must think people are idiots. I let him speak and was trying to hold back my inner thoughts. I will probably not go back. So if you go to this bar definitely pay with cash.",226,1
"My food was 4 stars might i say,  filet mignon steak cooked just like i wanted. Green beans and lobster tail- about 4 stars as well.  But here's why i give them 2 stars.  The waiter fails to mention that the salad he would be bringing, was a hunk of a slice of lettuce with miscellaneous items thrown over it, thus making it a salad! On top of that my lobster tail was twice the price of my steak. Last but not least, me and the boyfriend became severely sick.  The worst stomach ache and diarrhea known to man.  This was the last thing we needed to end our Vegas trip! We spent our last night taking turns on the ivory throne, pooping our lives away. We couldn't point out if it was the lobster or the steak.  The next day after having peptol bismol our stomachs settled and i had leftovers,  my boyfriend decided to take a chance with the steak again,  whaddaya know,  he's pooping his brains out once again.  Very bad experience and i don't think we will ever visit again.  Thanks for the overly priced laxative though.",245,1
"Lunch specials are cheap and okay for the price. Anything else is overpriced and pretty awful. Example, the udon there is super oily for no reason. It's more a bad Chinese take on Japanese food than anything.",46,1
Perfectly good place to grab a quick sandwich downtown. Quick service even during the lunch rush.,19,3
"I like this range! Sherri, who checked me in was very nice and friendly. I would come back more often if they weren't so expensive for the daily rate. Their membership and club rates are really way too pricey as well. I wish Green Valley had an indoor range where you could go and shoot without paying an arm and a leg.",72,1
How wonderful and delightful my lunch be! I had Asian Chicken grilled salad.  Fun place for kids. The have a nice play area.,29,3

"I've had a very good burger here but the fries were under cooked. The service on the other hand was horrible! It took a party of 3 (2 adults and a child) 25 mins of seated time before we even got water to our table. Asked my waiter for a 3rd set of silverware and never got it so I had to stop the manager as I saw her walking past the table with a few in her hand for one. Proceeded to tell her that we were not happy that it to over 20 mins to get water and we still did not have the appetizer and that I have a child that is starving and begging me for food as Im talking to her the appetizer hits the table. 2 mins later still talking to her and the food hits the table. All she told me was that they were having high turnover in staff and that it was very busy and if I would have sat in the bar area the better servers are in that area. UNBELIEVABLE!!! I should be able to sit anywhere in a restaurant and get good service!! Been to the STV location twice and same horrible service both times. My parents have also been there once and had the same complaint. Sorry manager that gave me a line of crap but I don't think its \""busy\"" I think your waiters suck. Get better staff if you want to keep your regulars! Management brushes off complaints here and refuses to take responsibility! This location is much closer to my house but I would recommend the Power Rd & Chandler Heights location as far as service.",319,1
"This place sucks. I wasn't let in because I had a temporary drivers license that I had got 2 days ago in Texas. I also had a had copy of my Texas security license, and my old i.d card from texas.

"The Renaissance Pittsburgh is an excellent place to stay. The rooms are spacious. The beds are very comfortable. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant. I was here for a conference with breakfast and lunch provided. The food was good and the dining room was beautiful with an amazing view of Heinz Field, Allegheny River and bridges. Braddock's American Brasserie is situated inside the hotel. The food was amazing! Would definitely stay here again. There's a parking deck across the street that's $5/day. Some kind of increase during special events but I wasn't here during any games. Valet at the hotel is $30/day and they park your car in that same deck.",145,4
"Great variety of coffee and methods (press, Chemex, pour-over).  I did not get a chance to try to the espresso, but it looked very good as well. Verve and Olympia are two very solid roasters and provide a wealth of choices. \n\nStaff was very helpful, location great. All around a good place in Pittsburgh.",75,3
This is my favorite Del Taco location in all of Las Vegas.  It is often my second stop (after Starbucks) after landing at Mccarran and picking up my rental car.  The staff have always been polite (even if not fully friendly) and the food has been consistently fresh.  Never a problem using a coupon or offer here either.  My favorite: they have crinkle-cut fries.  Yummy with their macho nachos (even if quite the fat-laden meal).,100,3
"I never buy shoes at Macys becuz Nordstroms is the best for shoes and Clothes..

They were so rude to me the guy was over in The watch dept Talking and they had to call for him..He didn't say a word to me when i asked him t get the shoes i wanted ... When i told the Manager He said I know we hear this all the time .. They are a leased Dept and we  have a hard time making them following the Macy way..",132,1
"I wouldn't have been able to say \""I've experienced better\"" right after my visit to Easley's, as I am not a costume shop regular, but I had been invited to a decade themed party to be thrown while I was vacationing in Austin and visited a second costume shop there. \n\nI left Easley's disappointed because I had very little assistance while there and felt the quality of the costumes was somewhat weak. They didn't have items in my size and had no alternatives to suggest. I had expected costume shopping to be fun and imagined the shop workers would be creative and helpful with putting something together. After all, that would be what separated them from a thrift shop, right? \n\nWhen that wasn't what I got at Easley's, I figured my expectations were too high, until I visited a shop in Austin and found it to be superior. \n\nSo, if I need a costume in Phoenix, I'll probably try Easley's again but I won't have real high hopes of finding what I am looking for or getting much help putting something together.",237,1
"SCAM SCAM SCAM!! I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN. They picked us up fine from the airport to the hotel, but going back to the airport was horrible. The shuttle never even showed up. We called them numerous times, the customer service lady kept telling us, oh the driver is on the way, just wait there. We waited an hour and 45 min. We had to catch a cab to the airport. We even called the customer service for refund, but they didn't even pick up the phone. \nSHOWTIME TOURS IS SCAM. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GREAT TIME IN VEGAS, DON'T EVER USE THIS COMPANY.",139,0

"It is strange that I don't have a review for them, and yet I have been here every year that I have had my Cosmoprof North America tradeshow for our annual girls night( a total of 7 times and counting) There are usually 7 to 10 of us lovely and we take a seat on the patio to people watch and enjoy a beverage ( or three) of sorts. The food is delicious! DELICIOUS! From the warm brie to the goat cheese to the steaks, to the pomme frittes, to the desserts. Sweet baby jesus you can't go wrong at this place. It seems that the drinks get stronger and stronger as the night progresses so w are usually fat, full, tired, and tipsy But no matter what, we always have a great time! See you next year ( if not sooner)",176,3
"The food was pretty good. Their sides are better than a lot of \""Mexican\"" places. I only gave it three stars because it's close to several other Mexican restaurants all of which have much better drinks and drink specials. The atmosphere was nice but my husband hated all the tacky gazing orbs. They might've been xmas decorations, though. Everything was good and I know I'll go back, but only because I can walk there. Great service from everyone we interacted with and all of the staff were very thoughtful and informative.\n\nUPDATE: I've upped the review a star since going back. Their $9.99 pick 3 combo really is a great deal. I'll be back again!",150,3

"Good Things\n\n1) Traffic seems to be way more organized, LVMPD cops are alot better at funneling traffic in and out of event parking zones since 2011. Although the rush to the exit still looked like a angry army of mice battling their way to a mountain of cheese, AKA, some serious road rage going on around me (see bad things).\n\n2) People seem to be taking into account my advice/tip I left last year, showing the good, getting in and out FAST area to park beside the Interstate-15 and Speedway Blvd Exit. Good! But I wish that all of the angry road-raging people that parked in the same lot as us would kindly leave and parked somewhere else at the start of each day.\n\n3) Although there were alot more headliners that I WISHED CAME BACK (Tritonal, EDX, Deadmau5, etc.) I understand that one of the main points of Electric Daisy Carnival is to showcase new or not widely known talent. That being said, I loved the performances provided by attending big names such as Dash Berlin, The Glitch Mob, Gareth Emery, Knife Party, Madeon, Arty and Kaskade. \n\nI also enjoyed the acts provided by talent I hadn't heard of experienced of yet (not \""not widely known\"" acts in general, just ones I never heard of), such as Flosstradamus, 3Lau, Bixel Boys, Syn+Cole, Martinez Brothers, and Oliver. I will be subscribing to their Podcasts soon to experience more of it, if I can even find those files online.\n\n4) The general consensus of the \""vibe\"" I am feeling when I am at least INSIDE the venue is fairly positive. I only had one nasty encounter with just one creeper. The people around me are super fun loving, alot better than what I experienced before like at 2012, where everyone looked angry, especially after that long-ago Saturday shutdown for high winds (in 2012). Usually at the end of the day, in the midst of all the road-ragers around me at 6:15 something AM, I simply cranked my music up in my car and made my car shake back and forth to the beat of the music to entertain everyone. It seems to distract them from violence. \n\n5) Even though I'm a guy, this one petite Latina girl gave me her Navy Blue Butterfly Tiara for helping her tie her leg straps on by illuminating it with a flashlight (the free one you get in the keychain from the ticket package). I put it on every time I went back for the next few days and I got compliments, phone numbers, and joint photos on Instagram accounts. Yay for me! And I have not heard anything negative either!\n\nBad Things\n\n1) I felt that the DJ lineups, especially for popular mainstream ones, were too tightly packed on Saturday, with at least three artists that I liked are featured back to back (Eric Prydz, Calvin Harris, Above & Beyond, Tiesto, Alesso, Benny Benassi for example, not all were Saturdays). I had little or no rest going to and dancing from stage to stage on Saturday, especially since we had to experience some on-foot \""road rage\"" trying to get from Circuit Grounds, to Kinetic Field, to Cosmic Meadows, to Neon Something and then to the bathrooms. I witnessed this poor worker in one of those ATVs get SURROUNDED by fans trying to go from one stage to the next, trying to call for help from security to disperse the crowd until they came with flashlights. The only time to rest was DURING when my favorites are playing, and I had to either leave the crowd to sit down on the asphalt or against the covered fences and risk being stepped or tripped over. Thats something I hate to do especially when I want to be standing up when my favorites are playing.\n\nI hope that next year you guys can have the obviously popular acts time slots sandwiched between the lesser-known acts on each stage, so I get to sit down for a hour to two and grab something to eat.\n\n2) I think we need some BRIGHT LIGHTS to mark the PUBLIC RESTROOMS SIGNS, its clearly apparent that even with those folding maps we get when we come inside, people will lose them and only know of the one next to Cosmic Meadows. After midnight, that entire area stinks really bad because its so heavily used. After Friday, to my disgust of having to endure the smell or the horrific sights behind those doors, I instead opted for spending more than 20 minutes going from Cosmic Meadows to the least used bathrooms at the Circuit Grounds. On the 3rd Day, I realized that the Budweiser Cool Lounge is also available to General Admissions over 21 years of age, and that they among other places I havn't discovered yet, has NORMAL CIVILIZED BATHROOMS THAT FLUSH. \n\n3) I am not accusing anyone specifically for using, selling, and consuming bad drugs... but compared to my experiences in 2013 and 2012 (my first EDC-Vegas), there is alot of people that have \""gotten sick\"". I either saw people puke right in front of me, stepped in puke, nearly sat on puke, or on my way to one of the Free Water Stations, the entire right side stank of vomit. I don't know what we could do about this, maybe have more workers or volunteers willing to clean it up?",1158,3
"The only reason I ever go to Nates is because it's walking distance to my house and they play hockey on some of the TVs. Food is good for bar food, service is usually sub-par, from both the servers and bartenders. The only people that are really treated well are the regulars. Almost every time I go there my drink is empty and I have to wave the server down to get any attention. Better bet is to go down the strip-mall to Valle Luna. Their bar is by far superior, both service and food.",113,0
"Went there after work with a friend yesterday,\n\nWe took a table outside since it was nice and breezy. Had a pitcher so white sangria, some chicken wings and fried calamari.\n\nThe food seems fine, the sangria was good though it could use more alcohol.\n\nThe batter for the calamari is very peppery and the calamari were tender and fresh. The fried chicken wing were a bit over fried and seemed dry but the sauce was really good so it was fine. The place closes at 9pm so no really a place you can linger and chat for long, but it's a nice place to sit and rest if you're downtown shopping.\n\nMaybe I'll try a burger next time lol",157,2

Eh. We didn't exactly enjoy ourselves here for a number of reasons (even though it was free and we were staying at the MGM). The biggest reason was that we were def looking to party but the crowd seemed really subdued and that made us feel really awkward. We stayed for  like half an hour and then left.,67,1
The Coney Dogs are just like back in Michigan. The menu is priced lower than any other coney shop in Phoenix. However the food is not lacking in quality or quantity. This a must visit restaurant if you love all things coney or if you want to learn. Will be a regular from now on.,63,4

"I had to take off two stars because they got our order wrong.\n\nWe ended up being confused as to whose plate belongs where. It took them awhile to realize we weren't eating....\n\nI ordered an Idaho kobe beef - Rib eye.\nMy brother ordered 100% wagyu new york steak.\nBoth of us got Idaho kobe beef new york steak.\n\nThis is something that should not happen to customers. \n\nHowever, the overall experience was worth the price we got.\n\nThey greet you right at the door, seat you at your table, place the napkins on your lap, and then a waiter will come straight away.\n\nYou don't really need appetizers when coming here because they load you up with a lot of bread (cheese puffs are amazing!) Then load you up with more bread. \n\nThey also refill you water constantly - if it looks like it's getting low, a server will appear to refill your water.  \n\nRight before each dish that arrives, a server will come to clean the linen and place mat before setting down the dishes.  \n\nAnd then someone comes around, educating you about the different beefs they have at CUT (they have 100% Japanese Wagyu beef and the snake river Idaho Kobe beef.  For those looking for 100% Japanese Kobe beef, don't look to getting it here - go to Shibuya inside the Bellagio. They serve it for $290).\n\nFor the sides we ordered the mac 'n cheese and the creamy spinach. I enjoyed the creamy spinach more, but both are good.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the banana cream pie with banana cream sorbet and banana creme brulee.  However, I only really liked the sorbet.\n\nWhen they bring in the checks, they give you some small sweets (one for each guest).\n\nOverall, this place had its ups and downs.  I would come back here just because I kind of enjoyed the service (aside from my order mix-up). The snake river Idaho Kobe beef was pretty good, and I may order it again next time around (or the Lobster, I had my eye on that also).",478,2
"I love trying new places and I've been wanting to try this place for a while but for some reason I wasn't too interested once I parked. \""Eh, what the heck!,\"" I said, so I gave it a try. I walked in and was told I could have a seat anywhere. It was pretty empty and thought it was busy, from what parking looked outside. Only 2 groups were inside. I took my seat of choice. It didn't take long for me to order and I thought my breakfast was going to be hot, once I receive it. Truth be told, I'm not one to be negatively critical on the places I go eat nor am I picky. I got my huevos rancheros and looked yummy. It came with 2 lightly fried tortillas, 2 eggs topped with salsa, refried beans, and hash browns. Unfortunately, my plate was cold. The beans, tortillas, and hash browns were cold, which made me not enjoy my breakfast comfortably. Although it did have great flavor, it was just cold. The owner was nice, though. I may give it another try for something different.",235,1
Sooooo I think I was expecting more but I really didn't dig the whole concrete floor with thin carpet feel and the tiny bathrooms. And also no room service. It was a bit chilly the night we were there and I had to brave the wind to run downstairs to order food for take out. Such a hassle. \nThe heater was also very loud. \nThe last disappointment was I thought the heated jacuzzi was a small lap pool so we ended up not going down to enjoy the heated jacuzzi at all. \nI do like that it's locally owned. Will come back to give this place another chance but I think during the summer when the pool scene is hopping!,140,1
"It's not really a coffee shop despite its name. It's more like a Denny's because they serve a variety of American food and they're open 24 hours. \n\nThe food itself wasn't very good. 3 of my friends and I shared a chicken pot pie which was more like thick chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl, cobb salad, chicken caesar salad, and a quesadilla. The salads were okay, and the quesadilla was very average. Nothing really memorable. But it's pretty dang overpriced. I guess that's expected as a restaurant inside a Vegas hotel. \n\nService was super sweet though! Everyone from the host to the servers were really nice and always smiling. But all in all, I'd rather eat at McDonalds than this place to get my service with a smile.",178,1
"Having worked at the Wynn, I'm biased towards everything they do.  Mr. Wynn wants a spectacular experience for his guests in everything the property does, and this place delivers in spades.  Yes, it's a bit pricey; but it's Wynn and it's worth every dime.",63,3
"Went with husband and a friend.  \n\nWe ordered food.   I ordered the blackened mahi.   I had it elsewhere in multiple states from Hooters.   \n\nHusband ordered the big fish sandwich blackened and friend ordered wings.\n\nHis was not breaded\n\nThe food came out and the fish on appearance looked fried.   The lady stated that it was breaded and grilled.\n\nI have never heard of such and as stated I ate at quite a few locations.\n\nSoon the manager (I assume) came over and stated that she can show me where it states breaded.\n\nIt doesn't state it on the menu which is common if something is breaded.\n\nAlso she said that it was a new item at that location for about 6 months.\n\nI ended up sending it back, because it was not what I anticipated and didn't want breaded and battered food.\n\nAlso since then I have been to a couple other Hooters in Phoenix and Tempe and they did not bread or batter the \""blackened\"" mahi.\n\nI will never go back here.

"Did I go on an off night?  Everything on the buffet was either hard and overcooked, undercooked, overbreaded or offputting.  Yes, the couple running the place were nice.  It was shopworn, but seemed to be relatively clean (normal spotting on the silverware and plates.)  I have been to China several times, I have eaten Chinese food in a variety of places all over the world, including dumpy sidewalk food...but, I do not remember, EVER, eating food as horrible as this place.  My dining partner and I both agreed it was the WORST place we've eaten in recent memory.  If anything, the negative reviews here are not negative enough.  Does the cook taste the food before putting it out front?  There were pieces of chicken that either due to the quality, or due to cooking the life out of it, that were impossible to chew.  Dessert?  Sorry, I was not going to chance my luck  on the jello cubes, the chocolate pudding or the other...well, I'm not too sure what it was.  We raced to Old Town Glendale to get a nice cone of Shamrock Ice Cream for its welcomed gustatory reset!

"Overpriced. Terrible service.  Poorly designed/portioned rolls.  The only pluses I can think of are the location and the decor.  Lovely patio.  \n\nWe stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered three rolls.  We requested all rolls to be made with soy paper instead of seaweed - a common request that has never been an issue at any other place.  Two rolls came out just fine... the third?  Under the soy paper was a whole second layer of seaweed.  What?  Okay, whatever... mistakes happen.  Unfortunately, our server was just dumb about it - \""Oh... I didn't know you didn't want seaweed...\""  Really?  You didn't know that is why we made sure we ordered all three rolls without it?  And then, even after having to wait another 15+ minutes for a newly prepared roll to come out... they didn't give any kind of discount for our trouble... oh no... they actually just re-rang the bill to make sure that they UPcharged us for that soy paper.  Fail.  \n\nWe won't be back.",243,0
"My experience with Land Rover Scottsdale has been nothing but a run around, poor communication and lack of professionalism. I purchased a 2013 Land Rover LR4 from the showroom floor without any reservation or hesitation at the beginning of December. We had originally wanted the 2014 full size Range Rover and placed an order but have yet been contacted (going on 5 months). When we purchased the LR4 the finance manager would not allow us to take the vehicle unless we registered in the state of Arizona but we are from New Mexico (NM driver license). After leaving the dealer and paying AZ taxes and registration fees we found out this was incorrect. We have been trying to work with the finance manager for the past several months to register and get a physical license plate for our LR4 in NM. Back in February I was told from the finance manager that for the inconvenience for my time he would get my wife and I jackets from the parts department and he asked for our sizes. I sent the size and have yet to see any jackets.  In addition when we purchased the LR4 there was damage to leather on one of the seats and a blemish in the paint that was documented as an \""I owe you\"" item in the purchase. When I brought the LR4 back for repairs and picked up the vehicle it was full of a white dust all over in the interior. The service manager came out apologized and wiped down some of the seats and stated he would give us a full detail the next time we brought the LR4 in. Overall my experience has not been the good and I have had better service at Wal-Mart. And yes I am still waiting for my license plate anddriving around with the second temp tag.",348,0
"Had my daughter check Yelp before she took in her truck to get brakes done. It was narrowed down to Professional Brake Service based on the reviews it received.  After picking up her truck today, I can verify and say all the previous reviews were spot on. Honest people, they know what they're doing, they don't cut corners and everything is explained in detail and easy to understand.\n\nJeff the owner kept in contact and called with the diagnosis within the hour, explained everything to Miss B. and to her dad on what needed to be done. I wont go into detail but know Miss B.'s truck needed major brake work done. see pic ( http://imageshack.us/a/img823/9619/picsay1363999708.jpg)\n\nRepair was done and got the truck back the next day as promised. When we came in Jeff and staff took time out to show us all parts that they replaced.  It clearly wasn't your everyday two hundred dollar special brake job. Her truck had some serious brake damage and they did a great job replacing everything. Truck was now good to go and Miss B. said her truck has never been so quiet.\n\nIve had nightmare issues with chain brake shops in the past that didn't care after you left their shop. I got a sense Jeff was concerned for our family's safety.  He kept emphasizing and told Miss B. to come in or call if she has problems and to come in and have her brakes checked in a year. Even gave her some driving tips!  I have complete confidence in this shop and will most definitely look them up again.",350,4

Luckily for me it's close to my work & my co-workers addicted to it too. The spicy miso is to die for. I crave it! Perfect amount of spice & heat. Their broth is thicker than manta but the flavor is stronger here. I personally prefer fukumimi to manta bc of the spicy & heat level of the broth & the different thickness of noodles offered. Fukumimi also has more appetizer & side options. The agedashi tofu & honey chicken is awesome. They also have a rewards card. For every 5 ramens you get a free app.",149,4

"Towed and ticketed for parking 1 inch into an unused driveway of a closed industrial area! We were horrified to find our car missing after leaving the fair at 9:45 pm on Wed night. We parked at 7:30 pm on Willetta between 18th and 19th Ave. There are two commercial driveways that are hard to see. Apparently this is an area that police ticket and tow vehicles frequently. No signs indicate no parking or where you will be towed. \n\nWe were lucky that someone on a bike told us the Phoenix police have up to 60 vehicles towed a night for the most minor parking violations and showed us the impound area which is on Grand Ave under the I-10 overpass. You are forced to pay $104 to the city for an administration fee plus $25 to the tow truck company plus another $70 to the city for the parking violation. Yikes, so much for saving on $2 ride night!

"They harassed me and were very disrespectful! And they laughed at me as I left when I told them my father had just died and I was In a low budget since I had to pay for the funeral services. Instead they wanted me to pay warranties I didn't want and expensive tyres. They were charging me $300 for something I got for $81 at the Discount Tyre on Bell Road and 19th. And when I was leaving, they sent another staff to follow me to my car and try convince   me they weren't screwing me from behind. Definitely a horrible first experience!! But had a great one at Bell Road. Definitely a different place with better costumer service!!",143,0
This place is a joke. Every time I have called they put you on hold for ten minutes.. Either having 2-3 receptions obviously isn't working or they need to learn how to answer phones,42,0

Great little hole in the wall! Free wine with dinner so you can't go too far wrong. The portions are huge so girls I would suggest sharing especially if you plan on going out after! The best is they have an elderly probably ninety year old little Italian man that plays the accordion he alternates between take me out to the ball game and I left my heart in San Francisco... It's fabulous!  This is a true las Vegas gem that is a nice break from the neon lights of the strip,103,4
"HUGE customer service fail today. I called ahead and made an appt for a mani/pedi. I showed up 10 min early and signed in, also indicating a mani/pedi would be desired. The girl who gave me the pedicure left for the day after painting my toes. They had me wait 30 min. All the while people walking in and getting in line. They then asked me to pay. I explained I had an appt for both and he claimed I didn't. I also explained that when I arrived 2 hours before their closing I marked I wanted both. Not even an apology. They let the people who walked in an HOUR after me stay.  I can't believe they didn't even apologize if it was truly a misunderstanding. Also, if you have us check off a list what we want? READ IT. There are 8 other nail places within blocks. You don't have a monopoly on the market. Customer service goes far.",206,0
"There are not many places in the legal district to grab a good sandwich or cup of coffee.  Thankfully, the Federal courthouse has this covered.  The food, while not gourmet or interesting, at least provides more freshly-made, nutritious options than the fare offered at the Bank of America building Starbucks (my other stop when I'm short on time).  The sandwiches are your run-of-the-mill white bread variety but the coffee is okay.  I've probably eaten here more than 20 times and have yet to have something that was terrible (or get food poisoning...yes, I have low standards).  Considering it's located in a courthouse, that has to mean something.\n\nYes, you have to go through security, metal detectors, and present ID, but at least it's not the Regional Justice Center....",176,2
"20 years ago I probably would have gone with five stars, but its important that people understand what this is.  First of all, the scenery is wonderful.  I saw wild horses and eagles etc...  But I went on a hot Saturday afternoon, and the wildlife that I saw in the tubes was far more extreme than the wildlife that was on the banks and in the air.\n\nBeware if you bring kids.  I don't have any, so this is seldom a concern of mine but the swearing, cussing, crude behavior (everybody brags about just peeing where they stand) and just out and out \""trashy\"" behavior would really turn off the average guy.  \n\nOne out of every 50 girls should be wearing the bikini's that are everywhere.  The other 49 should really just wear a normal suit.  Really ladies...there's nothing wrong with a normal bathing suit.  You don't need to compete.  We don't really need to see every one of the tatoos that you have.   But if you keep your eyes open you may see something rarer than a red-headed mockingbird.  There are some very attractive people hidden in the masses.  But some of them may still fool you and you'll realize its a disguise when they open their mouths and you hear \""Hey @$$H073...where's the M07&%FU3&I@G cooler at?\"" Or any one of a number of profanities that really just kind ruin everything.\n\nPlus, its packed.  You can be wrapped up on the river with 50 other tubes on a Saturday.  And if you're not enjoying the company of the people around you, you're kinda stuck with them for a bit.  \n\nSo beware.  If you're all about being crude and pissing in the water and getting into a fight because some drunk guy didnt like the way that you looked in his direction, then its a great time.  I had a decent time.  I don't have problems with people and I live and let live.  But I wouldnt want to take my niece and nephew.\n\nThere's a time and a place for this kind of fun.  If its your kinda thing, do it.  Its a frat party on the river.  Just don't drink the water.",510,1
"I came here dinner recently with a bunch of friends. After reading Jenny L's review I was hesitant but went with good spirits. Overall, my meal was A-OK. I had a burger with cheese, very basic. The bun was sub par and the chips were definitely the frozen ones that aren't anything to rave about it. My boyfriend had a T-bone steak and it was actually pretty decent - grilled properly. Edinburgh has a fair amount of good burger places and this place just doesn't compare. Mind you, I did enjoy a delicious Diam bar cake. However, on the positives I'll add that the service was really good and you really can't beat the 1 pound corkage fee. I won't be rushing back but if and when I do I'll opt for the steak!",169,2
"I appreciate the indoor-outdoor appeal of Chelsea's.  It's a little hard to hear if you sit inside, but that just means you can turn your attention to the patio. \n\nI've never loved anything I've ordered, but I have been more than once, so you know the food is still pretty good. Albeit spendy. \n\nChelsea's is one of those places where you can take your parents and your dad will feel comfortable because he recognizes things on the menu, or you can meet your girlfriends for happy hour and everyone will be at peace in their cute shoes sipping cocktails.\n\nLet this place help you make the most of our glorious spring!",148,2
"It's good...for what it is. I had the number 1, the number 7 and the Hallacas, (spelling)? The Hallacas (sp) was delicious, I'm not a fan of raisins and olives so that was my only complaint about it and that it came pre-made so I couldn't get them removed. However, despite my distaste for raisins and olives, it still came out pretty good. The breading they used for the Arepas though was outstanding, I actually could not get enough of that which is why I loved the #1 but also the #7. The #7 was a little more creamier than I thought but the breading had me finish the whole thing. The only real negative about the place as other people have mentioned is that if you go during the summer be prepared to sweat while you eat or at least wait for your food to be finished. However, it's a trade off since melting like Frosty the Snowman will always be tolerable if I can watch a priest, stripper, crackhead, retirees, and a man dressed as Catwoman walk by. (Yes, I typed that correctly, a man dressed as Catwoman, entertaining to say the least) This corner never fails to disappoint.",259,3
Lasagna was very subpar. Very noodle heavy and the noodles were almost mushy. Talapi was pretty good but not worth the price.,30,0
"I was in town for 4 days and decided to go try their box since I felt horrible after so much Montreal awesomeness food and drinks!! ;)\nShowed up on Saturday 10am for the regular group class. \nJacques, owner of the box, was very welcoming and made me sign a waiver and there I was, ready to workout. \nI was in \""deload\"" week at my regular box so I was very anxious to find out about the WOD. We did the filthy fifty which I scaled down(no excuse but i was so jet lagged!)\nIt went very well, lots of positive comments/advice from Jacques, the gyn is HUGE, so much space.

"OK, I confess. This is my personal watering hole. It's close enough that I could easily bike there on a \""Booze Cruiser\"", if I only had one.\n\nWhat's coolest about this place is that on any given night, you may run into someone you'll never meet again. How is this you say? In downtown Mesa? The Mesa Convention center,and Mesa Marriott are right across the street. I've met teachers from Sacramento, an Antiques dealer from LA, a tatto artist from Chicago-- and of course, tons of good natured Cubs fans.\n\nAnd even though I don't normally go to a bar looking for a serendipitous cuisine experience, I'm giving five stars because the food really is very decent for a bar. The Steak salad has real strips of steak cooked to order, tomatoes, red onions, and blue cheese crumbles. Bleu cheese crumbles in a baseball bar? Yep.\n\n The ladies that work here are all really cool and get to know you by name. There are huge Displays everywhere......even in the Men's room. I'm just sayin.\n\nOther than that- the regulars would remind you of some of the more far-fetched Simpson's characters- no joke.\nAnd even though a name like \""Diamonds\"" might remind you of a sleazy strip club- even on busy weekend nights, it just isn't the type of place that ever needs bouncers. Pretty chill overall.",312,4

Food as pretty good. Ordered Kimchee fried rice and garlic chicken. Kimchee fried rice was pretty good ( but i make way better ) The garlic chicken's batter was a little too thick for me. Would've given it four stars but the service was lacking. I told the woman at the counter that it was my first time here and came after reading the good reviews on yelp. She barely acknowledged that i even spoke. whatever...anyway I asked for a side order of kimchi and she said it was not for sale and they only used it to make their fried rice. I actually thought she was kidding but when I got home..no side of kimchi! Really? Well it was a little far for me anyway but now they have lost me for sure.,156,2
Went there during lunch.   Had the crispy pork jerky and sticky rice.   Was delicous but would like to experience more dishes when they expand their menu.,33,4
"They stuck us under the stairs - what?  Was it something I said?\n\nWe ate at the 'r bar cafe' part of the restaurant which is evidently more low key and casual.  While I enjoyed my meal (crab gumbo and a shared mac-n-cheese appetizer) and the by-the-glass wine list was decent, I don't think I walked away feeling like I had received my money's worth.  I completely understand that this is a very common feeling on the Strip, but that doesn't mean I'm letting them hose me again.\n\nAnd yes, the key lime pie is vastly overrated.",137,2
"I've been to Mastro's in Chicago and I had a wonderful dining experience and that is what made me look forward to the dinner in Vegas.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the food was excellent. We all went there hungry and were stuffed when we left. \n\nWe were, however, extremely disappointed by the service we received. It took away from the whole experience. It was about 15 minutes after we were seated to get a waiter to us for a drink order. The restaurant was not even that busy, which made it more frustrating. It took another 20 minutes or so after we got our drinks to put in our food orders, even though we told our server we were ready to order when he brought our drinks.  A number of the party has been in the service industry and that may have made us extra critical of the evening. \n\nOur actual meals came out quicker than it took to get them to our waiter. Then when we were super full and ready for our check, we had to flag down someone who was not even our server to get it because our server had been out of sight since he brought our food. \n\nFor what I paid for my meal, I was extremely disappointed by the service. I will say that my steak was cooked to perfection and our sides were exquisite. It's a shame that that was overshadowed by the service we received.",295,1
"The chicken is food-court quality, but the rest of the food is even worse. The chicken was greasy, the noodles were greasy and bland, and they refused to give us a cup of water - they would only (after asking several times) offer to give us some from the hand-wash sink when they clearly had a soda-tap that dispensed water. AND they had a stack of styrofoam cups! What else would you use them for??",92,0
This is my local Target and I love it. Both my daughters worked at this target at one time or another.

I was able to buy a Dyson vacuum for $175 off what everyone else was selling it for. \n\nI shop target for almost everything.

"First time trying Mediterranean food and it was delicious!! I will definitely be back for more, the staff was friendly and informative. Your meals come with sides like : rice, hummus, salad, fries, among other tasty ones. They have different sauces to go with your meal ,i recommend the cilantro sauce. Didn't wait long for our food which was awesome because one of our friends was on her lunch break so gave us time to actually enjoy our food. You also have the option of seating outside and for today that was an awesome option cause the weather was perfect. Try it if your around the area looking for a quick healthy meal.",129,4
"I filled out an on-line request for service on Easter Sunday and got a call back within about 30 minutes!  And, they were willing to come out that day if needed.

"This place needs more stores in it. From what I've read it's pretty new so perhaps when I return to visit AZ, they will have better and more stores. I picked up a few items at an ok price but for being an outlet their prices weren't impressive. The food court also really needs some massive help. I wouldn't eat at any of the places here. It wasn't crowded and parking wasn't horrible but I'm from overpopulated, crowded California so anything beats that. Not a bad place but I've been to better outlets with much better prices.",124,1
"I had a very nice lunch at Alchemy. I had the fried perch sandwich and it was delicious. My one complaint is that I might have preferred a thinner slice of bread because it was a bit overpowering. Overall the balance of the flavors of the sandwich was nice and I would definitely order it again.\n\nMy mom went with the stuffed grilled cheese and Alchemy fries, both of which she really enjoyed! I got a chance to try the fries, which were crispy yet still soft and absolutely amazing!\n\nThe star of my meal at Alchemy was the daily soup special, a coconut, beet and ginger puree. The waitress let us a sample the soup before ordering it, which I really appreciated. Upon my first bite I was so in love that I ordered a bowl on the spot and proceeded to finish the whole thing. It was amazing!\n\nI really enjoyed the atmosphere and food at Alchemy and will definitely return to experience their outdoor seating this summer.",196,3
"Finally I got to try this place!!! Yay!!!\n\nThanks to Amy K's suggestion, we ordered the drunken noodle soft crab and the northern red curry.

Definitely a must try.\n\nnorthern red curry: Yes, not much of a curry, more like a stew. Also not as sweet as panang..I think they use less coconut milk. So if you like coconut milk, you may not like this version of curry as much. \n\nbeef dish: it was a cold dish...cubed filet mignon..anyway, we thought it would be warm so it was a little surprising..it tasted like the beef on the beef salad...good but nothing extraordinary.\n\ncatfish: breaded and sauced...pretty good...loved it! put the sauce on our rice and ate it up! You must try it!!\n\nmango sticky rice: I looooooved this version...the rice was more complex in flavors than the others I've tasted...maybe I'm crazy...even  the mango pieces were perfectly ripe and was sweeter than normal, too...but it was really good...my friend who doesn't even like sweets, loved it, too...i could come back just for this...hopefully i'm not building it up too much...haha \n\nWish they were local...",323,3

"Fashion Show is a mega mall with almost all the brand stores you can think of. It's a great place to get a lot of shopping out of the way and you can spend the whole day there. \n\nBut like a regular mall the sales are not really that big of a sale (except for Macys, who are always on sale with discount on top). If you like to look and browse for deals and steals, I would go over to the outlets. \n\nThis place is good for out of towners who like to shop and really good for international travelers because the prices are cheaper than where they live.",131,2
We ate here after seeing Ka and had a great meal! The fried rice was wonderful and we also had some great sushi here. The price was great too for the amount of food we got! We will definitely come back if we stay at MGM again.,52,3
"RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!! ONLY GO HERE IF YOU ENJOY BEING SWEARED AT.\n\nMy review of this place is poor because this is the worst service and quite frankly, the rudest that I've ever been treated. I called to order a delivery dinner on a week night evening (and no, it wasn't super late, it was around 7pm). I spoke to someone who had a snotty attitude towards me, and told me that it would cost me a $5 delivery charge. I asked why, because according to the flyer that I received I was within the delivery area and that it was only $1.50. He refused to answer me until i asked for the third time, and then he told me that it was because they only had one driver. I asked why it would cost me extra to have something delivered when I am in the delivery area just because they only had one driver. His response was (and I quote) \""Take it or get the hell off my phone.\"" I was so shocked that all I could do was hang up. I've encountered some dissatisfying service, but I have NEVER been sworn at while trying to GIVE someone my money. I will NEVER eat at this place again, and I also work at ASU and have warned all of my coworkers about this. We tend to eat out a lot around the area to support local business, but NONE of us will EVER go here again.",302,0
"Super friendly, didn't try to hose me on a new tire, fixed my flat FOR FREE. Didn't even require me to have purchased the tire there that was fixed. Also professional.

"It's been 4 years since my first review of the union; a lot has changed since then.\n\nNotables:\n\n+ They are improving the appearance/layout of the outdoor food stands. There's a new, stone-clad stand that serves food (brats, burgers, chicken, grilled corn) and beverages (beer, wine, soda, water). It looks nice, but could be more fully staffed. This past weekend, the wait in line took more than 15 minutes per trip.\n\n+ More construction in progress - look for an updated pathway (near the water) with a gazebo and additional beer carts. \n\n+ You can bring your four-legged friends. HOWEVER, you will only be allowed to sit with them on the lowest level (nearest to the water) on the terrace. I don't quite comprehend this rule... it's all outdoors, right? There's absolutely no shade near the water, so bring sunscreen and some water for your pooch (and yourself).",218,2
"The lunch specials here are great. I had the lamb chops and it was surprisingly pretty good. Beef, chicken and lamb kabobs were also very tasty. The pork chops were very flavorful. The rice that they serve here is awesome (BUTTER BUTTER AND MORE BUTTER) . The lunch portions are huge. It comes with salad and rice. They moved to a bigger and much nicer place a couple of doors down. No frills Mediterranean place that is decently priced.",94,3
"I think you gotta love the \""Stillers\"" or be a Pitt fan to understand why anyone would think this place is terrific.  Sorry guys, I don't necessarily get it.   This is certainly not the most horrible stadium I have ever visited, but it sure isn't up to snuff with many of the other stadiums about the country.  Went to a Univeristy of Pitt football game over the weekend.  Since I am from out of town, I was not familiar with the layout or where to enter in terms of where my seats were located.  Got some pretty bad directions from the staff working outside of the stadium and needless to say, I spent almost the entire first quarter of the game attempting to find our seats.  \n\nI will say that once seated, the view is good and nothing that I could see would impart your vision of the field from wherever you are sitting.  Food offerings are your standard fare (hot dogs, soda, hamburgers, nachos, etc,) - nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nThe main concourse on the street level is pretty nice, and gives you a nice sense of the history of the \""Stillers\"" and is really a walk down memory lane, even for those of us who don't live in Pittsburgh but remember the teams from the 70's and their glory days.  (Yes, admittedly, they are still a pretty terrific team!).\n\nLoved the Heintz bottles on the fan-o-vision that tip over and look like ketsup running down the screen - very cool!",327,1
No one told me this place was on the same level as the Riviera...... Come on I couldn't believe how bad they let this place slip. I used to come here often. Stopped for several years. No real reason why. A friend came in town and got a room here. Everything from the casino floor to the rooms looked like it needed updating. Not worth the money. O and the buffet is disgusting and vile.,87,0
"After having had some underwhelming meals at our hotel and around the convention district, this place was a BIG treat. The service was spot on, and we knew the meal was going to be good as soon as they brought out their special mixed chips and dark, smoky salsa. After our margaritas appeared (their special margaritas come out with a refill in the shaker), our entrees did not disappoint. Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla, and our friend's intriguing 'naked' chili relleno. Portions were beyond generous, and thanks to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free. We chose the banana burrito and had no regrets. Highly recommended. Sad that I won't be back in Phoenix any time soon - I'd definitely come back if this were in my city!!",164,4
The menu has so much more potential beyond sandwiches and old fashioneds. Sit at the bar to avoid the wait and to get the best service.,30,2
"I really dislike giving bad reviews, especially to an establishment owned and operated by someone as sweet as Aurora, unfortunately the staff does not have the same passion as her. Our food also was nothing extraordinary.  It had potential, however \""meh, I've experienced better\""\n\nFirst off, we sat for 10 minutes without a waitress coming to our table. Finally when we did get seen by Jennifer, it was quite the underwhelming experience. We ordered Mac and Cheese minus the pork, the duck leg and eggplant parmigiana. \n Oh and to start, we got a bruschetta, and also the olive selection.\n\nOn the plus side, the potatoes where on a bed of greens with a roasted potato and date vinaigrette. The duck was a very modest portion and a bit over cooked. The mac and cheese, was nothing special, and the eggplant parmigiana was undercooked to the point where the puff pastry still had a raw dough taste in the middle. \n\nThe space is nice, and funny enough the older gentlemen sitting next to me said \""don't get the steak special\"" when I sat down with his wife quickly chiming in stating his name in disbelief. I dunno, a restaurant where you pay $65 bucks for two to eat with no drinks, should be a bit of an experience. The servers should be professional, put together and at your table within a couple minutes to take your drink order and go over specials. I cook, and I eat. When I don't want to cook, I expect people to be on point.... and this was not.",331,1

"I have eaten at this Yard House 3 times now because of the location.  I really love their Surf and Turf burger!  It does get very busy and I'm not a fan of restaurants who crank the music up so loud, you have trouble hearing the person across the table from you.  That said, service is always top notch and they have been accomodating because I need a slight modification to the meal.  However, last night my burger arrived with the cheese I specifically requested be left off (can't do dairy).  I flagged our waitress, Lindsay, down and she was very apologetic and said she would have it redone.  She stopped by to let me know it was in the works.  The general manager, James, also stopped by to apologize and ensure me that it was being taken care of.  Although I was disappointed about another wait, I was very happy with how they were responding.  The burger finally arrived, it was perfect!  Lindsay stopped by to make sure I was happy and then James came by to make sure it was done right and then told me since I had to wait so long, he would comp my meal!  I would have been happy to pay for it just based on their great service.  I felt that this was above and beyond what they needed to do but was very appreciative.  Thank you, James and Lindsay, for making my day!",290,4

"Stayed here for a wedding this past October and my favorite part of the experience was that they allowed my dog free of charge and there's a great dog park around the corner.  They even offered her a doggy bed.\n\nSo that being said, the room was fine, it was clean.  Check-in and out was smooth and everyone was nice.  The pool was smallish, but there was a water slide that they will turn on if you ask.  Unfortunately, it's not meant for adults and there were a couple close man overboards.\n\nHere's my beef: I road trip a lot and even at cheaper accommodations such as Super 8 they offer a free continental breakfast and free wifi.  No such luck here.  I prefer Marriotts where they offer not only a continental breakfast but often also often offer some happy hour snacks, unfortunately Marriots charge too much for my dog to stay. \n\nThe restaurants in the hotel were not worth the price, and other options were not walking distance.  At least parking was free and there was a mall not too far away.\n\nHere's the other beef:  We were here for a wedding and the bride and groom specially reserved a suite so that they could party after the ceremony.  About 11 o'clock on the wedding night, which happened to be Halloween and a Saturday, the hotel staff told them to keep down the noise and that everyone should go back to their own rooms.  It was not a loud gathering.  There wasn't music playing and everyone was in their 30s, so we're not talking a crazy time.\n\nI guess this is more of a quiet old person's hotel so if you're looking to have a few drinks at your fancy hotel suite after a wedding on a Saturday night this isn't the place for you.\n\nMy boyfriend recommends the Bloody Mary's served at the bar in the lobby.",414,2
"Worst.  Massage.  Ever.\n\nI guess I should clarify that a little.  \""Worst massage experience ever\"" is a little more appropriate.  I came to this establishment because I bought a Groupon for a 60-minute massage and optional spray tan.  I was a first time client, which is what these marketing promotions are supposed to attract, right?  Well, rest assured I will never step foot on the premises again.  If you don't want to read the whole review, the take-away keywords are: unprofessional, trashy and appalling.  \n\nThis miserable tale begins with me arriving a few minutes early to the strip mall where this place is located.  The office area appears to have a number of people operating various businesses out of one space with one common waiting room.  Fifteen minutes after the massage was supposed to start, Jan Thompson (owner) came out, apologized for running late and said she would be ready in a moment.  \n\nAfter a few minutes, I entered the massage room that doubles as a spray tan application area.  The room was rather trashy, with products and random things shoved in corners and around the perimeter of the room.  The room was right next to the front door so it wasn't very quiet.  Also, the front of the room consisted of store front windows that were somewhat poorly covered both in style and effect.  The room did nothing to lend itself to a relaxing environment.  Had I been paying full price for this massage I would have probably just turned around then but since it was only $39 I figured I'd just go with it.  \""How bad could it be?\"" I foolishly asked myself.  Jan introduced herself, told me that she would be using hot stones during the massage if that was okay and then asked if I had any requests.  I said that I had been to the chiropractor the day before and would like her focus on my lower back and leg muscles.   She said she would be happy to do that and said she would be checking in with me throughout the massage to make sure the pressure was okay.  I said that would be great because I tend to prefer more of a deep tissue massage to which she responded \""I have strong hands so I'll make sure to check to make sure it's not too much.\"" \n\nThe massage began with Jan attempting to strike up some conversation.  Personally, I don't care to talk during a massage with someone I'm not familiar with but, whatever.  She asked which chiropractor I was seeing.  A seemingly innocuous question, right?  I told her my chiropractor's name to which she responded, \""Oh, I don't like her.  She soaked my mom dry.  She had her on all this stuff, some sort of powder, and none of it helped her...\""  Now, I'm all for sharing personal experiences and reviews (obviously) but I didn't care to hear Jan trash talk my chiropractor and personal friend DURING MY MASSAGE.  I find it incredibly unprofessional for someone to make such comments to a total stranger, especially in this setting.  I responded with a vague, placating comment and tried to just shrug it off in hopes of salvaging this massage.  Unfortunately, there was no salvaging to be had.\n\nThe massage continued adequately with the use of hot stones and some stretching.  Suddenly, I hear some beeps behind me and a whirring sound.  Jan said she was warming up a neck pillow for me to help relax my muscles.  I think this was the first time I've experienced a microwave being used during a massage-but this massage was pretty atypical from the start so I just rolled with it.  And then I began to hear a vibrating noise.  At first I thought I accidentally turned my phone on vibrate instead of silent until I realized it was coming from a table closer to my head.  It was Jan's phone, and it kept vibrating.  There were probably five phone calls worth before she stopped the massage, told me she had a flat tire and needed to check her messages to make sure the towing company wasn't outside.  In shock, I said \""okay\"".  She proceeded to listen to all of her messages, apologized and then continued the massage.  After several minutes, the vibrating began again and after a few more calls she again stopped the massage.  She again apologized and said the towing company was outside and she needed to step away for a few minutes.  I just laid there, in awe of how ridiculous this experience had been so far, and just said \""okay\"".\n\nAfter about five minutes Jan came back, apologized again and said that I could come back sometime and she would give me a free 30 minute massage to make up for the interruptions.  The massage had lasted 45 minutes at this point and I was still lying on my back.  My one request was to have my lower back and leg muscles focused on and we hadn't even gotten to that yet.  The remainder of the massage consisted mostly of the use of hot stones and her elbow.  The \""strong hands\"" that Jan mentioned during the opening act of this farce didn't make much of an appearance at all.\n\nI could go on with some of the other comedic details but I ran out of space.  Keep your free 30 minutes, I won't be back.",1146,0
"Am I the only one who thinks that an Ethiopian food place is odd? I mean when I was but a young 'un, and didn't finish my plate, my parents told me about all those starving kids in Africa who would love to have the food and all - how can they have a restaurant?\n\nBut I digress. In actuality, there are multiple Ethiopian places to eat in the Queen City, and Meskerem is just the latest that I've tried. The ones I have tried share the same two common traits: One: The service is excellent. Way more friendly than most \""American\"" places (perhaps my parents sent them all my leftovers, and they've spent all this time looking for me to share their gratitude). Two: Injera. This cold, spongy bread is just odd.\n\nIt is pretty cool to be able to eat with your hands, and if young me had it way back when, I might not have had any leftovers to send to those less fortunate, so the service might stink. But for those of us who grew up on a limited palate, it's just strange. Note that I never said I didn't eat it, but it takes some getting used to in order to do so.\n\nLuckily, being able to eat with your hands really helps in that regard, and the flavors from all the other stuff seeping down into it does as well. If you take any leftovers home (not sure if this is common in Ethiopia), then heating it up at home the next day makes it even better.\n\nWith all that in mind, Meskerem is probably the best of the places I've tried for Ethiopia. I just have to make sure they know I'm not sending them any more leftovers. Of course, they could probably look at me and figure that one out.",382,3
"You know what you are getting when you walk through the door.  The menu does change slightly but everyone has their favorites.  \n\nWHat does add to this location is that the staff is usually friendly and in a good mood.  At other locations, you get a fast-food experience from a fast-food staff.",70,2

"How can I possibly give an establishment one star if  I have never eaten there, or even been inside?  I will tell you!  \n\nWe spotted this restaurant while driving around and tried to make a mental note of where it was located because we frequent Harvest Cafe and wanted a back-up if it was good.  Unfortunately we never found this place again until last week.  Eureka!  We decided to go and check it out as soon as possible so I called them and the lady who answered the phone said they were open until 3 p.m.  3 p.m.?  Who can make a living only being open from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.  Isn't this Vegas?  You know 24/7 or at least 8 p.m.\n\nWhen we arrived there was one car in the parking lot just leaving...ut oh...the place is empty!  All the signs in the windows say they close at 2 p.m!  2 p.m.?  You've got to be kidding!  We missed it by 5 minutes?  And, who spells  \""country cafe\""  with K's?  You cannot possibly find this place with any app or yellow page looking for \""cafes\"" - I know as I searched for weeks!\n\nSo make a note it's open from 7-2.  Guess it's good for breakfast and lunch, but not for dinner.  I sure wish they were, because if they are good we certainly could use another cafe around here.",336,0
"First time I went here was a couple years ago and it was horrible!  The cooked food was all dried out and portions small, and over-priced.  Didn't go back because of that, until just recently to give them a second try.  \n\nThe rolls were small but this time the fish was fresh.  Menu said Sashimi was 3 pieces, but I only got two.  So, much better this time, but nothing super impressive.  They use the cheap jarred ginger with food coloring added instead of the good stuff, like some other places in town. They use horseradish paste that's died green, instead of wasabi, but I'm noticing all the places around there are doing that too.  \n\nAlso, I really don't like that all their rolls that say \""crab\"" do NOT have any crab.  They use Pollock (a white fish) instead.. Lying to customers is NOT good!!  You couldn't get away with that back in California.  \n\nOne great thing, this is the only place I've found so far with good Salmon roe (Ikura .. which is actually the Russian word for caviar stolen by Japanese spies).  It was wet and firm, not dried out an mushy like all the other places I've been to in Charlotte.\n\n Sushi is a bit over priced for what you get, but still an ok place.",301,2
"This was one of the best meals I've had in Madison!  I went to school there so coming back 5 years later I went to some old favorites but decided to try somewhere new as well and was very impressed with it here. To start I had the seasonal punch which was peach flavored and absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I split the graze burger and the mac and cheese with pulled pork, both of which were stellar! The atmosphere of the place and the view of the Capitol wasn't too shabby either!  Will definitely be making this place a must-go next time I'm in town.",125,4

"Some background about the setup: Customers can walk in and order take out at the counter, or be seated by a waiter to eat in. While we were there for around 1.5 hours, only one other group was seated but around 4 people came in to pick up their take out. \n\nI came here with my family around 3:30, just past the designated lunch period, so we were stuck with the dinner menu. No biggie. \n\nThe waiter was super attentive and polite, timely and conscious of water refills.\nWe all went with the plate sets which is cheap at around $10 for HUGE portions! None of us could finish. I ordered General Gao's Chicken with broccoli and beef and white rice. The food is pretty average to above average American-Chinese food, nothing really authentic here. Much better than Panda Express though! I guess the one authentic thing was the music they were playing, it was straight from the mainland. My Mom loved it. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere was inviting, waitstaff was great, and the food, although not authentic, was above the average American-Chinese. Will probably drop by again!",246,3
Visiting the in-laws for the holidays. They tend to visit the same 3 restaurants over and over. I took it upon myself to find them something new. We had six people in our party ages 5 to 75 and there was something DELICIOUS for each of us. The service was great; the atmosphere was delightful and the food was outstanding. It seems to be in a more industrial part of town and I was really questioning my decision when we pulled up but don't let the neighborhood or the outside of the building fool you. Eat there!,116,3
"Had been wanting to try this place since before it opened, and finally got to give it a go this week! Unfortunately we were still full from lunch, so we didn't get to eat as much as we would have liked, so I'll review based on what we did have...\nOur server was great. She was super helpful, and helped us decide on cocktails, which were awesome. My husband had the Bells n Whistles, a spicy whiskey cocktail (don't order if you don't like spicy!) and I ordered a sparkling strawberry gin martini (can't remember the name but it was delicious!) We ordered the pretzel bites with fondue and the burrata (yeah, we like cheese, what about it?). The pretzel bites were...ok. A little less than warm for my liking. The cheese sauce (more sauce than fondue) was yummy. The burrata was OMG. I would definitely get it again. It was served with compressed pears, bacon syrup, walnuts, and greens, and the flavors and textures were all perfect together. \nLike I said, by this point we were already full so we called it a night, but we definitely plan on coming back again and again until we have tried all the yummy things on the menu!",260,3
"When I heard that Moe's had opened shop in the EpiCentre I had to give it a try.  I am a big fan of Moe's.  There are plenty of what I call the \""Big Giant Burrito\"" places, but here is why I think Moe's stands out above those others.  They give you free chips and salsa with your BGB.  They have 5 kinds of salsa including a tasty tomatillo salsa which is my favorite.  Less than a week old this Moe's was running fairly smoothly.  The line for food was 3/4's of the way to the door, but it moved quickly.  The staff assembling the BGB's did a good job of moving the line along.  \n\nHere is the one bad thing about this location.  The cash registers, salsa bar, drink machine, lid & straw station, etc, were jammed into a corner that has a support column right in the middle of it.  The 100 flavor coke machine didn't seem to be holding things up too much, but salsa bar, lids & straw station did cause a bit of a traffic jam. I was able to get my food, drink, & salsa, find a seat, eat and get out in about 40 minutes.  \n\nSo even though it was busy it wasn't too bad to get in, eat and get out.  Moe's is great and the layout works well except for the corner of delay.",314,3
"In the death throes of Big Wong the place had really  fallen apart. I was glad to see that the new owner had revamped the place. Nice decor...TABLES OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS. These tables are not only something that you'd expect to find at the top of a beanstalk, but I think archeologists will have a big find in a few thousand years (sturdy). The walls have been tastefully painted. The ceiling has been restored to it's 1970's, stick your pencil into, glory.\n\nFood: Hot. Great gobs of hotness. They give you a scale of hotness (I love thai people) of 1-5. I hesitantly ordered my Spicy Noodles at a level 4. My wife ordered her pad thai at a level two. My dish came out at a perfect heat for me. The noodles could have been a little less done. I couldn't taste the spice at all, but my wife still enjoyed it. \n\nAll in all, I'll probably be back.",226,2
"Don't go here....not even if you're curious.The first time I went I ordered a Arizona Steak and cheese. It was described as being on \""French Bread\"". What I got for about 12 bucks was a big ball of \""Mush\"" and a side of ruffled kind of chips that seemed like they were pulled from the bottom of the bag...and not much of em! There was no French Roll..it was a mish mash of tasteless slices of roast beef and a messy goo of cheese and topped with some kind of soft spongy sweet roll. I went back again thinking maybe something else would be better. I ordered a Grilled chicken sandwich that also comes fried. It wasn't bad but wasn't great. I wanted fries with it and got a mix of soggy sweet potato fries and average tasting regular fries. I didn't want a \""mix\"" but wasn't sure what \""mix\"" meant ...my bad for not asking. Listen, this sandwich was like 13 bucks or more with tip and all that...It wasn't very filling...I expect better bread on these sandwiches and better quality sides at these prices! I'm not even going to mention the service. It would take too long and I no longer have the energy to keep typing..thumbs down",267,0

"Papa murphy's gourmet veggie. I dream about it.\n\nWe have ordered other pizzas but this is THE one. My husband has tried their pepperoni and still surprisingly  prefers this veggie pizza. It is piled HIGH with tons of delicious veggies (the good stuff- artichokes, zucchini, etc) and cheese. And it has a tasty, zippy garlic sauce.\n\nService is always super friendly.\n\nLook for their coupons in the mail. Not drastic savings, but a few bucks off. And tastes better than Dominoes.",117,3
"I was really excited when I heard about Greenbush Bar. I'm a huge pizza guy and I love New York style thin crust pizza, which they apparently serve here.\n\nSo I went to Greenbush Bar with the fiancee and we ordered an appetizer and two pizzas. Both pizzas were burnt black on the bottom and my excitement subsided. We tried to address the issue with the waiter to no avail. We were not offered a new pizza  nor were we compensated with the bill. It was not a pleasant experience. The only reason I gave this place two stars was because I saw the potential. I was able to try parts of the pizzas that were not burnt and, though I hate to admit it, it was decently good.",151,1
"First time here and choose this place from Yelp. Ordered the special for today, Jerk Mahi-Mahi with a blueberry and vanilla cream sauce and side of collard greens and mashed sweet potatoes.

"Phenomenal...\n\nI had the spring tasting menu and was absolutely blown away by every plate. The ambiance is very cool, and the counter service is great. Sitting at the bar allows you to watch the sous-chefs painstakingly prepare each plate. At times we were amazed by the amount of time and effort that was put into making the plate \""look\"" just right. This was a great experience, and I look forward to eating at Joel Robuchon's flagship restaurant next door.\n\nAs for the food:\nThe foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam was perfect and a wonderful start. \nThe langoustine fritter was the most decadent item on the menu, and disappeared way too fast. \nThe pork belly was cooked to perfection and the best I've had to date. \nThe Sea Bass was elegant, but not nearly as rich as the rest of the menu.\nThe frommage plate was great, but I wish I had saved room\nand everything else was great, but not quite as memorable.\n\nAlthough pricey, it was worth every penny.  I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas.",247,4

"BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it.  Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about.  \n\nFirst off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.\n\nThe service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.  \n\nNow onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. \n\nThe chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.\n\nBrisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.\n\nRib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.\n\nCollard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!\n\nSweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.\n\nThe starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter. \n\nOne last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.\n\nOverall two thumbs down.  Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley.",570,1
"El sol bakery is one of those places that everyone says \""You have to go there\"" or \""OMG....it is so good.\""  So over the past 5 years I have gone there 3 times.

I have always liked the food, once I have gotten it.  But there in lies the problem with El Sol Bakery.

"casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, and i'm usually not a huge fan of sweet drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. no complaints. then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.\ni'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.\ni love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well.\ni'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus!",279,4
"***Some of the dishes I had at Salt of the Earth were a little underwhelming, but there were still good things on the plate and the ribeye and salmon (with the skin on) looked very good***\n\nSalt of the Earth is a popular and relatively new restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Salt of the Earth is in a great space.  There are two floors of dining areas and this combined with the high ceiling really opens up the dining room.  The downstairs dining area is very simple and comfortable, but it is also sleek and modern with a good use of blonde colored wood.  There is a great chalkboard on one wall, which lists up the menu (the menu seems to be very spontaneous with frequent changes).\n\nI really like the upstairs dining area because you get a great view of the downstairs dining area as well as the kitchen as they both cook and plate.\n\nThe menu features a lot of good ingredients with several interesting flavor combinations.  I started with the octopus, which was served with white bean puree, chorizo, crisp radishes, crunchy almonds, a cilantro pesto, and oranges.  The octopus was very nicely done.  It was incredibly soft and had a very interesting texture.  The octopus almost shredded like crab or braised meat.\n\nI did not like the chef's choice for the other ingredients on the plate though.  Everything was fine, but I was just not sure if all the flavors went together that well.  The white bean puree was also a little cold.\n\nNext came pork loin with a poached egg, farro and chorizo risotto, green tomato jam, pickled okra, and mustard seeds.  Like the octopus, the cooking of the pork was very good.  The pork was very tender and had a good amount of juiciness.  Once again, I was not a huge fan of all of the garnishes, which kept this dish from from being exceptional.  I also did not like the color of the dish.  Still, the plate definitely showed the talent in the kitchen.\n\nI did happen to see their ribeye special and salmon special and both dishes looked excellent.  The skin on the salmon looked crispy and flavorful while the ribeye had a great thickness and color.  The garnishes there also looked more traditional so those two dishes might have been better representations of what the Salt of the Earth kitchen can put out.\n\nFor dessert, I had zucchini bread, which came with crunchy sunflower seed brittle, rhubarb sauce, brown butter powder, and fennel ice cream.  The zucchini bread was good--nothing exceptional but good.  The brown butter powder was interesting and I really liked the fennel ice cream--good, unique flavor and very creamy.  It was not my favorite dessert, but like a lot of the dishes at Salt of the Earth, it really shows the potential of this restaurant.\n\nService was great--very personable and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.\n\nPrices were very reasonable given the high quality ingredients used and the generous portions.\n\nSalt of the Earth shows real potential.  There were definitely elements in each course that I really liked and I think if you order right here, you could probably have a very good meal.  There is definitely good sourcing of quality ingredients, a seasonal approach, talent in the kitchen, and a contemporary approach to the menu.  All of these pluses make Salt of the Earth one to consider for an upscale but still casual dinner in Pittsburgh (while I did not love Salt of the Earth, I would definitely give them another shot if I lived in Pittsburgh).\n\nYou can find metered parking on the street.",760,3

That experience does technically fit the definition of \""special,\"" but I think it's not what they were after.\n\nI know they're trying for quirky, and succeeding.  The name comes from the space's previous use as a newspaper office.  But what does that have to do with the weird but sort-of-cool airplane fan thing near the front door?  And why is a tortilla and egg dish named \""rarebit\""?  Do they know what \""rarebit\"" means?  Does it have some meaning I don't know?  \n\nI know that I sound like like a poop in the last paragraph but this is the kind of monologue in my head as I sit at the Courier Cafe.  I sit, mystified, and work my way through a plate of undistinguished food.\n\nThe one ray of light is that for some reason they sell the cut-up edges from pans of brownies in bags by the front register.  They call these \""brownie bones.\""  There are two kinds of people in this world: the person that likes the squishy center part of the brownie and the person that only likes the crunchy edges.  They aren't always available, but if you're the latter, I suggest you do stop the courier to buy a bag of crusts.  Just don't stay for a meal.",493,1
"Great job, guys.   You just lost a rave, 5 star review and a loyal customer.\n\nMy husband goes twice a week at least after working out to get a soda and a cup of water.  Cup of water is always free EVERYWHERE, until now...now you have to pay $1 for the cup (which is extra dumb, because a cup of soda there is $1...I guess soda's free and we're just paying for cups at McDonalds).\n\nI'd understand if he just walked in and asked for free water, but he was a paying customer, and they know him there as he's a regular.\n\nAlso, very convenient that they suddenly start charging for tap water right when the hot summer weather hits.  Shameful.",166,0
"Large large large very large portions. I was so shocked at the portions and even more shocked at how cheap the bill was. The Omelets are amazing and I wish I had tried the french toast. I know that it would have been amazing. I am more than happy with our visit here. It was last minute and it is a hole in the wall that LOOKS tiny but is huge inside. Don't expect for it to look like a 5 star restaurant this is a very old and old fashioned establishment that apparently has to be appreciated for what its always been. My server was very very nice and I loved her personality. Its easy to judge this place if you have your panties in a bunch. The worst part about it was that there was a large soccer team there and there were a bunch of little girls and one of them decided she wanted to Laugh the ENTIRE TIME! All jokes aside, she laughed LOUDLY the ENTIRE TIME. It was overly annoying but it had nothing to do with the food, or the service there. :)\nI will probably go back one day, but I dont live out here.",227,4
"Snagged a reservation here for a saturday evening the day before, granted it was the 5pm slot when the restaurant had just opened. We had the braised leeks, the santa barbara mussels and the pasta with rock shrimp. Although the leeks were good, i think the reviews hype it up too much. The mussels had a different preparation than I had ever tried before. The pasta was probably my favorite dish. I would probably order some more vegetable dishes the next time since I hear that is what the chef prepares so well. Overall, I really enjoyed myself and appreciated all the fresh and local ingredients which made for a very simple and tasty dinner.",133,3
I already loved the delivered pizza. Never been inside. Inside there is seating with a waitress who us awsome!  Try the Sicilian Pizza... omg the best thick crust in town. Meatball pizza is fantastic. But today I'm doing pepperoni. ... well so much for the diet :),60,4
"after reading all the good reviews about this newly opened cafe, i decided to give this place a visit.. they have a wide varieties of gluten free cakes, starting from banana cream, cinnamon, blueberry, raspberry, chocolate, etc etc.. i couldnt make up my mind on which one to get but i thought that the red velvet cake is a must try since the cafe itself called 'red velvet cafe', i ended up buying 3 of their cakes; red velvet, banana cream, and chocoate fondue or something. each cake cost between $5.99-$6.50 or something. the total for all these cakes were exactly $20 including tax.. definitely not cheap and in fact, its expensive.. \n\nfirst of all, for the amount i paid for each cake, i'd expect a nice and well presented cake.. but that doesnt seem to be the case.. the whole presentation is off and awful!! even the cheap asian bakeries would give you way better decorated cake with nice toppings.. this is what my red velvet cake look like when they handed in my cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-velvet-caf%C3%A9-las-vegas-3?select=IKZNZ_EV4gIEwmZGERWw0w#IKZNZ_EV4gIEwmZGERWw0w).. the same goes for the banana cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-velvet-caf%C3%A9-las-vegas-3?select=IKZNZ_EV4gIEwmZGERWw0w#UdYwVl7C5qXwVby_Ss0G6g) and chocolate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-velvet-caf%C3%A9-las-vegas-3?select=IKZNZ_EV4gIEwmZGERWw0w#ONidhQoNkOqZDs-dJD0O5g). it also doesnt taste as good as what many people have said.. the cake is too dense, flavorless, and the creamcheese frosting taste nothing like creamcheese.. its more like butter sugar!! totally disappointed with everything.. i should have got one cake instead of 3, but i thought that i drove all the way from CA to vegas, so i might as well get more to bring back to CA.. o well, i still need to finish the rest of the cake anyways..",524,0

What happened to US Airways? I used to fly with these guys all the time a few years back and it was fine but now it is completely ridiculous. We arrived at the airport with plenty of time (or so we thought) but due to the enormous lines that only plagued us airways customers we ended up boarding our flight just before the doors closed. Now I am sitting at the tarmac in PHX with barely enough time to.make my connecting flights and they are giving us no info or assurance that we will make it. Add this airline to my no fly list along with spirit.,118,0
"Why oh why would you be a sports bar in Vegas and not be great? Our waitress sat us at a table with a pole yes like a pole dancing pole. Since there was only 2 of us the staff decided to use the part of the bench I wasn't sitting on the slam down their menus, this happened about 6 or 7 times during our lunch it was annoying as all hell!\n\nThey had more tvs than you can count but some of them were so dark that they were hard to see. So if you just want to watch a sport with no sound I guess you could go here.\n\nThe food was average I got the pulled pork and there was just too much sauce but the pork was cooked just right.\n\nOur service was lacking and it wasn't because they were busy they actually had a server for every 2 tables. They were too busy complaining and gossiping about the other employees. Really people save the drama for later customers don't want to hear about it.",212,1
We went here today. I must say it was the best breakfast spot my family been too. I had the oats and it was delish. My husband had the special. It was the buttermilk biscuits and sausage gravy. It was absolutely incredible. And my kiddo got pancakes! The were fluffy and oh so good. Run don't walk here!! Great place!,75,4
"Non smoking hotel, the main reason we decided to stay there. A bit of drama staying there, we will get to that later....\n\nOne bedroom corner suite, private foyer entrance, living room is fairly spacious, with full kitchen, dining table, full guest bathroom with shower, comfy sofa, couch seating, in room safe, floor to ceiling windows. It just there is NO refreshments and snacks in the fridge, just 2 bottle waters??? Why? We drove in late and I was thirsty, I needed some drinks, room service was our only choice, at least the food and drinks were delicious. Service was good too cause they already charge service fee in the bill. $25 resort fee each day was not worth it, we tipped housekeeping nicely to get more bottle waters and lotions. \n\nBedroom is good, comfy bed, floor to ceiling windows with beautiful views, the bathroom is huge, with oversized jet jacuzzi and nice shower. It's supposed to be a great experience with a bathroom like that, they have TV in there too. \n\nBUT.... Beware of the glass door in the restroom! The bottom of the glass is really sharp, hurt my food pretty bad! I cut two of my toes, and I was bleeding so bad! \n\nHad to call security to take a look at it, they were pretty nice though, asked if I wanted to go to the emergency room, brought me band aids, first male security called in a female one to help me take care of my wound, filed a report, gave us a number to call if it gets infected later. And they put me on a wheelchair to get me out of hotel to my car, we were about to check out when I hurt my foot, they told us not to worry about check out time, just rest long and comfortable enough to leave. \n\nWhat an accident! I was in so much pain, but everybody was very nice and helpful, got me calm enough to leave the hotel. \n\nI loved the service and staffs of this hotel, the suite is OK, not much of my style, and the restroom door is extremely dangerous! I am so surprised nobody has ever hurt their feet from it??? \n\nNot going back to stay for a vey very long time. :(",476,2
Was welcomed on coming inside the front door. Shown how to use the tablet to order and to customize our order. I went with the breakfast steak bowl with rice- amazing. I was only able to finish half. My other half went with a BIT wrap and took out half the stuff. He's not a health nut but was satisfied. I will be returning!,75,4
The ambiance and decor is STUNNING!! Reminds me of southern country chic. You could definitely host a large dinner party here. \n\nThis is more like 3.5 stars because the food was just ok. I ordered the scallops appetizer and the bruschetta appetizer based on other reviews on yelp. The size of the scallop itself were so tiny!! Did not look like any of the pics on yelp. The crispy rice was way too hard so I just ate the scallops. The flavor and preparation was good though. The bruschetta was the best thing I tried although it was not memorable and something I probably won't crave for in the future. Also had the truffle fries and that was good too but nothing special. \n\nMy friends had sandwiches which looked better than what I had. They both loved their meals. So maybe I will go back to try other dishes/apps and give an updated review.\n\nOther than that prices are decent and decor and ambiance is amazing!,207,2
The people that work at this Autozone are awesome! I needed a headlight for my Honda and I wasn't sure if it was going to be difficult to replace. The manager replaced it himself for me. I truly appreciated the help. I have been to this location a couple times and they are not pushy and don't sell you stuff you don't need! I highly recommend this Autozone.,84,4
"We came to Flemings for our 30th wedding  anniversary after reading a lot of review's on yelp for steak houses in Vegas I kept coming back to this review ... Well let me tell you there was no disappointment in our choosing...  My husband is very hard to please when it comes to steaks as we raise our own grass fed beef he was amazed at how good the flavor,tenderness,of the Bone in Ribeye was I had the Petite Filet which was equally amazing... Both steaks were cooked to perfection sides were well proportioned...  The service (TJ) was great as well... I really liked that fact that even though this is a A+ restaurant in my opinion it has a very comfortable feel to it.... One short minus no Coors Light or Oyster's on the half shell... The Calamari was great as well.... We will defiantly be back......",183,4
"It's a DoubleTree Hotel, so you get free, warm cookies at check-in. Score to that!\n\nOther than that, the location being so close to State Street (about .3 miles) and having a warm indoor pool, it was just standard. I didn't find the hotel to be particularly amazing in any other way.\n\nWas the bed comfy? Sure.\nThe room spacious? Yeah.\nThe bathroom clean? Yup.\n\nBut nothing stood out as especially better than a Holiday Inn. And the construction with the hammering at 8 a.m.... was less than welcomed. I guess they have to do construction at some point... but of course it had to happen while we were there with our 1-year old for the night!\n\nWe'd stay there again, but wouldn't hesitate to consider our other options. \n\nParking: must pay, but it's upstairs and many of the spots are covered... so that's a nice touch.",215,2
"This was probably my 4th time staying in the wonderful paris hotel, I will say that the rooms themselves and very nice, but we got a horrible view, the room service food was good, even though it took an hour for a continental breakfast, i will say the lobby and casino area is very pretty, even though the slot machines suck, and that the people are friendly. \n\nI would only go back here if I was just sleeping there... but then again, it is vegas, and that is all you do in your hotel room anyway.",115,2
"Usually when I'm super hungry everything tastes good. But this place is disgusting. I'm not even picky about food that much - especially Chinese food. Their noodle sauce was sooooooo bland. We ordered class and when we got our dish, half of the clam shells in  DID NOT have any clams inside. The beef sauce tastes so salty and weird - it tasted more Korean than Chinese. Their service is terrible. Terrible terrible terrible. Waited like 7 minutes to be seated when there were plenty of seats available. Never checked up on us. The worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. DONT GO HERE",127,1
"Hey white slice pizza...I want you badly!  \n\nThis simple secret pizza joint found somewhere on the 3rd floor at the Cosmo in Vegas is serving crack pizza and they are calling it \""The white slice\""\n\nI don't know what's on it, it's so simple and plain...just some kind of cheese and maybe some garlic? I dunno, but it is PHENOMENAL! I actually ordered a slice with a bunch of stuff on it cuz the \""white slice\"" looked so plain, but I took a bite of my friend's and liked it better than the one I ordered! I went back and ordered it 2 more times. \n\nI think they close around 4am because when I first went to try it, it was closed :( I wanted to try it after seeing it featured on a TV show couple years ago and I always remembered it and boy am I sooo glad I did :) I dream about this pizza every night! I need this pizza in my life!!! \n\nTHE SECRET'S OUT!!! :D",227,4
"The staff was very courteous and friendly. The food was good but I was looking for something better than ok. I love breakfast and I was hoping that they had specialties but they did have pancakes and the kids did like it. The decor is awfully blue and I didn't quite understand it, it's really smurfy blue with patio furniture. But food was cheap and very fulfilling, it's just lacking a cozy feel.",89,2

"Not even close to In-N-Out quality but burger is good like your grandma makes in her skillet.  However, the patty is a little dry. Probably since the \""100% Angus Beef is smashed on the grill\"".  Bad technique for burgers since smashing patties squeezes the juices from them. French fries are very unspectacular.  Dinning room is your basic strip mall sub-leased space but decent decor.  Great shakes with real Haagen-Dazs ice cream. One area where SB separates itself from the others is they have iced mugs for their root beer and have beer and wine as well.  Was expecting more because of the hype, but burger was pretty good anyway.  Not on the same level as In-N-Out or Five Guys but definitely better than your normal fast food burger joint.",172,2
"I usually go to Regal Stonecrest Cinemas 22 because (a) I'm in the area shopping or dining already, (b) they offer movie options (including 3-D screenings) that other places don't, or (c) because they have so many theaters, they're showing the movie I want to see at the time I want to see it.   Other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this particular theater.  It's usually very crowded with teens who just like to \""hang out\"" in the lobby or outside, the ticket lines move slowly, the automatic ticketing machine is usually broken and/or isn't set up to accept my Regal movies rewards card, their rewards program isn't that great, and the lobby (especially the snack counter) and theaters aren't as clean as they should be.  Regal could learn A LOT from AMC Theatres in many respects.",197,2

"Groupon offered a $1 lunch deal yesterday at Rosatis, so I thought I'd give them a second chance. It turns out I just wasted my time. When I showed up to pick up my order I was told that my $1 deal was supposed to be a $15 deal and that if I wanted to pay an extra $14 I could get my food. This is wrong on several levels, one of them being that it seems pretty obvious they were trying to cheat Groupon. Venders get 50% of the Groupon price, so if it was really $15, they would have only received $7.50. \n\nI left without my food, which I assume they had to throw away, because they wouldn't honor their Groupon.",165,0
"The rooms are clean and the service is decent, but the walls are thin enough to follow the television programming in the room on one side of your own while simultaneously enjoying the ecstatic moans and mattress squeaking from your neighbors on the other side. Thankfully the rooms come equipped with a refridgerator, and the constant grumbling  of the ancient cooling unit will do its best to drown out the ruckus in the adjacent rooms. If you're not the type of person who is lulled to sleep by the groan of struggling machinery, unplugging it will only give you the peace and quiet necessary to truly focus on the aforementioned activities of your neighbors.\n\nIf you're checking in here because it's stumbling distance from the establishment next door with women in various states of undress displaying their vertical barre workouts, then this place is for you, and you'll no doubt be either too drunk or too busy to mind the noises coming from the adjacent rooms or your ailing fridge.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in an uninterrupted night of sleep, you'd best look elsewhere.

"Mix is one of those restaurants that has been featured in Wallpaper, CondeNast etc. I can understand why. The various reviews hadn't really prepared me for how decadent the place is. My hunnie had scored us a table on the outside patio so that we could watch the sunset settling over Vegas. The view alone was worth the visit to Mix. The service was impeccable. The meal was delicious. We had a cappacio of some sort of white fish for appetizer. I can't remember the name but the dish was phenomenal. Bursting with flavors, the fish was fresh and the taste was fantastically balanced. My hunnie had a pork roast which was served in a mini personal roasting pot. THAT had tasted so good, I kept stealing from him. I had bison for the first time. It was good, but not wow. The peppercorn gave it a nice kick, but compared to the pork roast... it just wasn't as good. yeah, so i kept stealing from my hunnie and he ended up finishing my bison for me. hee.\n\nAfter dinner, we headed over to the other (the black side) of Mix for drinks on the other outdoor patio. There, they had these bedlike sofas which you can lay down upon and drink your drinks seductively. Very cozy. Highly recommended. Oh, and if you're at Mix, you HAVE to HAVE to check out the bathroom in the black/clubby side. You have this amazing floor to ceiling window in your bathroom stall and your \""throne\"" is placed so that you sit FACING the pretty lights of vegas. It's quite dramatic. Really have to be experienced.",342,4
Not much to say about this inside of the Chevron here I have never been inside when I do go I will add to this. I have only put gas here. It is nice that it is right off the freeway. They keep the grounds here clean from what I noticed. Chevron is a little bit more than the Circle K that is on the other side of the freeway. Call me crazy but sometimes when I do put this gas in my vehicle it seems that it lasts longer. Maybe I am crazy but oh well.,105,2
"After getting out with some great friends of ours for the first time in a while, we decided to take them to Sauceman's. I'm a huge BBQ fan and Sauceman's was one of the places left on my list in town. Though this location doesn't seem to be much from the outside, it definitely holds a firm place in my BBQ-loving soul amongst the other varietals in town. \n\nI had passed by this little building so many times on my way in and out of Uptown and always wanted to stop in. It's pretty small inside with some tables and a walk-up counter to order at. \n\nWe started with some fried pickles and onion rings. Fried Pickles are somewhat of a ubiquitous app in town. Throw a stone in any direction and there is a joint that serves em the same as a few others in town. They weren't really anything to write home about. I actually wasn't too thrilled with the flavor and only ate a couple. The onion rings were great. Thick, but battered cooked correctly so you don't end up pulling out the entire onion from the inside of the batter housing. Well done here, ladies and gents in the kitchen. \n\nI ordered the thick cut pork. Nice chunks of pork and a nice change of pace from my typical goings of the chopped variety. I really enjoyed the larger pieces and eating them with a fork and knife. The flavor was fantastic and their Carolina Mustard BBQ sauce was a stupendous addition. The hushpuppies they serve with each meal are some of the best I've had in town. Huge ones, too. Not small like others I've had, which was a nice change as well. I just freaking love hushpuppies all around. Very happy with my entree. \n\nAnother big plus was the fact that they had Triple C's Smoked Amber on draught. Such an incredible brew and works rather well with BBQ. \n\nThe service was great. One girl and a few people in the kitchen were holding down the entire operation. \n\nNext time, I might check out their wings as I've heard they are of note. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm stoked about heading back to Sauceman's rather soon.",478,3

"Whoever knew there was such a good breakfast place in Vegas that is away from the strip? \n\nVegas is not only a place to go to for gambling, clubbing, and drinking. There's plenty of fine restaurants and good food to look for. My goal is to discover new places to eat at in Vegas that is worth reviewing. \n\nThis is the first of the list to start the day off. I had the country fried steak, scrambled eggs, country potato and a muffin. This has got to be one of the best country fried steak i ever had. The gravy had so much flavor and was not salty giving the fried steak just the right amount of flavor and salt. Scrambled eggs were avg and the country potatoes were avg too. \n\nAlso had the egg Benedict and a New England Benny. \nThere hollandaise sauce is perfect. The original Benedict is good and they had other Benny. The New England Benny is a crab cake Benedict. WOW is all i have to say to that. The crab cakes is a must the next time I go back.",226,3

They also have a decent selection of ice cream and a whole bunch of other delectable goodies to choose from! They also have a pasta station which isn't too bad either. Another really good thing about this place is that their salad is really good. The service isn't too bad from what I can remember. XD",137,2
"The wings are large (they have Wings, Boneless, and Chicken strips) they have about 6 to 8 different flavors so not much of a selection, A meal is about $8, and I think the worst part about the place is that they take FOREVER to get your food out- yes, the food is made fresh, but if you're on a time crunch I don't recommend eating here. The seating area is small. I like what they do with the fries though, they add a bit of sugar to it so their sweet (regular and seasoned fries available)",120,2

No literally, the valet came out with his arms wide open and asked, \""where do you plan to park this thing?\""\n\nTo be fair, I showed up in an oversized Toyota Tundra and trailer...

I asked if he greeted all of his guests this way, and he realized that he came off as an ass and tried to correct the situation.\n\nI ended up getting a parking space a half mile away, and walking back and forth to my vehicle.  \n\nI'd recommend this hotel, as long as you live a straight forward, in-the-box life. We needed special accommodations regarding our stay. The manager assured me there'd be no problem and she'd get back to me.   She left for vacation without ever getting back to me. When I followed up I was told to literally go stay at the Sheraton, despite the fact that I was staying here as part of a very large conference, and had previously been told they'd make it work.  Not how I expected the situation to be handled. \n\nPretty disappointed overall. The hotel was nice, but the people weren't. I'd recommend the Sheraton.",264,0

"This place is in a strip mall, so that already seemed kind of out of place to me, but then I saw the greek place and the indian place two doors down, interspersed with a barber shop and nail salon.....yes, still seemed out of place. I always want to get my nails done and then go eat with my hands at ethiopian food! \n\nThat aside, inside this place it is actually pretty decently decorated and they even have half of the place set up where you can eat on those little chairs and basket tables for a more authentic time. \n\nOur waiter was really white, and when he brought us our sambusas he gave the vegetarians in our group the beef ones and said they were lentils!!! You would think that a vegetarian friendly place wouldn't do that!! That aside the sambusas were a little smaller than usual, but they were pretty tasty.  Their vegan lentil plate did not really do ethiopian food justice here, but their other veggie curry and bean options were pretty good and flavorful. We had to ask for extra ingera (ethiopian naan basically) and water too, but the meat lovers liked their meat plate and  veggies liked their veggie plate, after they spit out the beef from before!!!\n\nSo Blue Nile watch out for beef posing as lentils!",274,2
Staff is really nice. Rooms are adequate. The pool is really large and has waterfalls...and was clean when I was there. I didn't have to wait for anything. Lazy river was neat. The restaurants on site are spendy...but tasty. Great for pool fun w kids.,60,3
"The sushi chefs were very cool. \nI ordered two of their rolls on their happy hour menu - very average. No better than any other sushi place in Vegas. Two rolls, happy hour, still $20? AYCE runs $24-29 around the city, so why go roll-a-la-carte? Makes no sen$e. That's not a happy Happy Hour. :-(",86,1
"I was visiting from Chicago and my Padre took me here. I get it its midwestern food. I had Chorizo and eggs it came with Potatoes and you can choose either toast or biscuits and gravy...AWESOME! I love biscuits and gravy and the fact that I can get it with my meal at no additional charge is even better. My only problem was that the waitress was kinda a B-word. She was all upset cause I didnt finish my food. Come on lady...I dont stay skinny eating a pounds of Chorizo, eggs, potatoes, and biscuits and gravy. Though that would be nice.",123,2
"I had dinner here last week.  We went on Thursday night and there was a 45 min wait.  Good sign I thought!  I have no problem waiting for great food.  We took a seat on their patio and ordered a drink.  I ordered one of their signature cocktails with strawberry's and basil.  The waiter warned me that the drink was very strong and sweet,  since I like strong drinks I went for it.  This drink was terrible. TERRIBLE!!!! Not to mention I had to shell out about 12 buck with tax and tip for this undrinkable concoction.  Let me just say I am not dissatisfied because it was overly strong or sweet.   But rather because it was disgusting.  This is where St Fancis loses one full star from me.  \n\nOnce we were seated our server was very attentive and nice.  We were seated at a table right inside the door next to a lager table set into this glass alcove.  It looked very cool but once the birthday party with eight ladies took their seats this alcove turned into a megaphone projecting everything this group of ladies said right into our faces.  It was so uncomfortably loud that it was actually painful to my ears.  I found myself holding a hand over the ear closest to them.   We could hardly hold  a conversation.  I ordered a salad to start and requested it without the bacon, the kitchen either did not get this request or overlooked it, because my salad arrived covered in pig.  The goat cheese appetizer was pretty good. The forbidden rice and the pork chop were excellent.  If I were only reviewing our entr\u00e9es then this place would have gotten five stars.   \n\nAll in all we dropped around $100 for two people.  I am in no hurry to eat here again.  Although the entr\u00e9es were so tasty that I may be inclined to order just those again to go!",415,1

"Arrogant owners.  Been here twice or thrice for to go orders.  If you're not dressed up like a rich person the manager/owner wants you to be out of their place.  This is not even a high end restaurant.  It has like 8 tables.  The cooks and servers don't seem happy working here.  That guy who seem to own or manage the place is just discriminating of customers who don't usually dress up.  C'mon dude you are not a 5 star restaurant.  \n\nAbout the food, it's meh, nothing special about it, except them claiming that's Cebuano recipe.  \n\nTwo stars because one of the workers was really accommodating.  The girl and the guy who looked like the owners need to be more welcoming to customers, regardless of how they look.  \n\nThere are better Filipino  restaurants around.  Not recommending this one.",199,1
"The food was bad and over priced.  The waitress was slow and not helpful.  She couldn't even think of anything to suggest we get when asked.  Also, she served me a beer that was only 3/4 full and charged me $5 bucks for those 6ozs of bud light.  \nThe bartender single handily ruined the night for the group with rude comments and D bag behavior.  At one point he called out some people in our group over the PA system to stop cheering about the beer pong tournament because they were annoying. This caused a few of them to be insulted.  They were not out of control or anything... just gave a woot to our friends who were playing.  \nBut hey no worries, Mr. Bartender,  I'll never suggest to any of my out of town guests, who are looking for some fun, to spend any of their money at Blondies.",194,0

"Great addition to JL and the cafe is more spacious than it first appears. Also, worth noting that if you can't be bothered schlepping to Frederick St for Hotel Chocolat then all your needs are met in the store within the cafe here! \n\nSo, came here on the promise of GF griddle cakes. There are GF options (savoury as well as sweet) and they are marked as such on the menu so kudos here.\n\nI had a salted caramel hot choc - lovely and could definitely taste the salted caramel. It probably wasn't my best choice though as chocolate on chocolate is too much for me.\n\nThe griddle cakes were good! Like a pancake and slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, they were yum. Two generous helpings of chocolate spread were provided, as was a little round of cocoa nib butter. The slight saltiness of the butter with cocoa through it was lovely. The chocolate spreads were great too but hence the reason I'd avoid my drink being chocolate when I have this dish again as it was together, all too much sweetness for me (and I am all over the sweet stuff).\n\nSo the decor is all dark wood and chocolate tones and staff are friendly and helpful. Despite it being a Saturday, it was fairly quiet (a good thing) so more than happy to return :-)",282,3
"WOW. WOW. WOW. I frequent the actual original location in TJ and this place has a bigger menu and OMG it is even better than TJ! Salsa is delicious, juicy limes, quesadillas and mulitas de al pastor is the ONLY way to go. I also tasted the carne asada which was flavorful and juicy, the chorizo was GROSS. I had much better chorizo from the TJ location for sure. $2 for tacos, $4 for mulitas and quesadillas and $10 for carne asada fries that feed an army of 5 or  a few very drunk people. I think that Tacos Mexico down the street will go out of business any day now since this place came into town.",143,4

They also sell 20% off dining vouchers, but we didn't care for any of the restaurants on their list. \n\nTixs4Tonight was a hassle as we ordered the tixs on the phone, then had to go to their ticket office (thankfully no lines at the time) to pick up vouchers, then go to Wynn 1 hour before the show to exchange them for Le Reve show tickets.\n\nTry Vegas.com, Groupon, or even Travelzoo beforehand for shows that you want to see.",194,2

"I rate The Fountains of Bellagio 5 of 5 stars. As a frequent visitor to the Las Vegas Strip, I am also a frequent visitor to the Bellagio and specially The Fountains of Bellagio. Dancing water fountains which are synchronized to the music are graceful, beautiful and relaxing. Each show is a totally different and worth waiting until the next show! My best tip is that if you are planning to stay at The Bellagio, make sure you get a room with a fountain view! You can listen to the music on your TV while you look down on the fountains. Each show is about 3 to 5 minutes long and show times are every 15 minutes. The fountains look good in the daytime but really shine in the nighttime! Wow! Highly recommended!!!",159,4
"All the cupcakes looked beautiful at Les Glaceurs.   And the ice cream whetted my appetite.  These were all wonderful, but then I saw the macarons, and I knew I had to have them.  I bought a bag of four for five dollars and ate them in one sitting.  The four kinds in the bag were (I think) pistachio, vanilla, chocolate, and mocha.  Of course they were good, but they were not as fresh as the macarons at Point G.  \n\nAlso, the service here was not great.  I was the last person in line and after the person in front of me was rung up, the cashier ignored me and went to the back to clean.  I had to practically bang the counter to get him to come back out.  \n\nThis is kind of in a tourist area and although a very cute place with several gorgeous looking cupcakes, I might find another place for desserts in the area.",202,2
"Don't come for the service at breakfast time.\n\nMe and the Hubby went a few weeks ago and I wished that the review would show up on the check in date instead of the write up date but...\nWe went for breakfast, were promptly seated, then waited, and waited, and then our waitress (I usually call them servers seeing how I was one for many years, but not in this case) finally gets to us and takes our drink order and sighs because I wasn't quite ready to order.\nWhen we did order, my hubby was asking me what he should get out of 2 things and all she heard was him saying something, heard it was a menu choice and decided he was getting that for breakfast.  Meals came out timely, they weren't the greatest things ever, but it was IHOP, and didn't expect them to be; however, they were pretty good, he had gotten some moons over my hammy type thing they have at Denny's and I got the double BLT and was happy that they didn't make my bacon crispy.  Finally got a drink refill and with it came the question if I needed a box...not if I was going to  need one, as I am still eating the last half of my sandwich and fries are gone, but the question wasn't brought up to the person that still had half a sandwich left and was no longer touching it.\nThe bill came early almost the same time the food was dropped off and I guess that is protocol for them and by the service I guess she felt that since she dropped off the ticket that we no longer required service.  Talked to the guy in charge at the time and he made excuses and so I told him that we wouldn't be returning to any IHOP for a while and never again to this location",380,1
"First time at this restaurant we found it from Groupon. Small little place, not that clean, silverware is cheap and stained, bathrooms are disgusting.  So we weren't sure what to expect from this first impression plus the pricing on the menu was so low we decided to only order pizza, we were afraid of what an $8 order for a pasta dinner might end up being.  \n\nSalads arrived and we were surprised, they were fairly large with fresh greens and good dressing, not from a package.  The pizza arrived, we ordered half white sauce and half red sauce, one side ham and tomato the other ham and pineapple.  It was GREAT! Nice thin crust, cheese was good and toppings adequate for quantity.  The pizza was pretty oily, like another reviewer wrote , I'm not complaining just letting you know.  We couldn't stop gushing as we walked out the door by what a great meal it was and such a good deal and we wondered about how good that spaghetti would have been had we ordered it. \n\nAn extra large pizza for $12.99 and we walked out with plenty left over for tomorrow. I would have given this a 4 star rating or more if the place had been cleaner and the silverware not dirty.",266,2

"I am usually not one to be so harsh in critiquing a restaurant but this place was a disaster from the beginning! The place was empty and they still sat us in a little table all the way by where there was no one. Our waitress was nice but very inexperienced. She took forever to come to our table, when she took our drinks order we had to remind her twice about my drink. We brought a wine to be opened and she sent some one else to open it because she was afraid!! She never brought out bread for us until we asked her to. We all had the ribs which where delicious but the service was so terrible it ruined my whole birthday dinner. Sorry to say i will not be going back to this place, and i have told many people i know not to go there.",162,0

We tried the crispy duck curry, sea bass with onion & ginger, soft-shell crab drunken noodle, pad see yew, tom yum goong seafood soup. They were all very delicious!

I ate here twice during my stay at the Hard Rock. \n\nLunch wasn't as bad but the 2nd time back for dinner was less than stellar. \n\nThe restaurant was absolutely dead and the hostess insisted I sit at the bar/counter. I told her no as I wanted to have a table. She sat me but wasn't very pleased. \n\nMy waitress was nice enough although I thought it was odd that she decided mid-meal that she had to refill my sugar and salt/pepper shaker even though the entire restaurant was less than 5% occupied.

"We went here last weekend, and I almost forgot to review it because it was just that underwhelming.  \n\nWe were seated by the kitchen, which meant every 5 seconds someone came bursting out of the metal swinging doors running.  I was briefly impressed by the quick pace of the waitstaff even though the constant bursting of the metal doors was annoying.   It made me think \""oh wow, these guys are on the ball!\""  That wasn't the case for our waiter.  His demeanor, movements, and voice indicated that we had gotten the stoned waiter.  Not the the giggly, silly stoner, more like the \""I'm barely conscious\"" stoner.\n\nI had to repeat my order three times to him to get it right \""Mole burrito with mixed vegetables.\""  At one point he asked someone in our party if they wanted a refill on their soda, the answer was yes.  The refill came at the end of the meal with the check.  As other waiters were practically running back and forth, our server was seen trudging slowly and aimlessly at times.  Maybe he was lost, maybe he was on a journey, maybe he got some bad weed.  \n\nThe food itself was underwhelming, that is, when it finally arrived.  The tortilla used for the burrito was pretty soggy, indicating it had been sitting around for a while after it was made.  The mole sauce was insulting.  I make a better, meaner mole at home that puts Casa's to shame.  The appetizer cornbread was the best thing out of all the dishes, but like someone else had mentioned, there wasn't enough butter to go with it.  \n\nThe atmosphere is strange.  Big, open, cavernous spaces filled with tables, and a terrible acoustics problem.  Get a bunch of people in there, along with the exploding metal kitchen doors, and I couldn't hear anything my dining companions were saying unless I leaned in, turned my ear toward them, and asked them to repeat themselves.  \n\nBad service, mediocre food, and terrible atmosphere combined equals a bad time, and no repeat performance.",453,1

"I was disappointed with the Cafe at the Wynn.  The food was just okay and the service (although nice) was extremely, extremely slow.  It took us over 2 hours just to eat a small brunch-type meal here.  The drinks alone took about 10-15 minutes to come out the first time. Plus, there is a line here to be seated.  Three of us just ordered appetizers (a chicken skewers and a bread/shrimp salad) and one of us ordered the continental breakfast.  This should not have taken so long.  The food was fine, nothing wrong with it, but no wow factor.  And, for the price, we could have gone to a much better restaurant.  It was a drain of over 2 hours.  The bloody marys here were also fairly lackluster, not spicy enough and no celery.  I would not return here and there are better options, although it is a nice looking restaurant.  Maybe the whole thing with the pricing is because of the $50 dining credit, but that's not cool if you are not staying here.",230,1
"My fiance and I were excited to see a dumpling restaurant open in the area! I'm in love with soup dumplings. And China Mama down the street does a pretty good job of it. It's no 626, but its still good.\n\nThey have their own parking lot. Plus! \n\nBut first impression is.. the place smells. It's a very pungent bathroom odor. I wouldn't mind if it smelled like cleaning supplies.. but a smelly bathroom/sewage scent is NOT the way to go when you're eating! But it's an asian restaurant. Things like this slip through the cracks all the time. We stayed. We eventually got used to it.\n\nThe menu has a lot of items! Most of the English descriptions are pretty vague. So the pictures help a lot. We got lost in all of the choices and took awhile to order.\n\nWhen we did, we ordered the pan fried beef patties, the soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup. \n\nThe patties were good. Crispy, flavorful, and tasted great with a little bit of vinegar and hot sauce.\n\nThe hot and sour soup was not as savory as other places I've had, but it was tasty as well. Full of flavor, jusy enough sour. \n\nThe soup dumplings normally take longer and were the last to arrive at the table. Tip: normally if you know you're ordering this dish, you should put in the order first. The dumplings were good. As a personal preference, I like my dumplings more sweet than salty, but here they make it salty. Also, there is actually not that much soup in each one. \n\nThe menu had other delicious sounding items so we'll probably be back to try other items. But they need to fix that smell!!\n\nOverall.. 626 dumplings beats NY dumplings beats China Mama beats Dumpling King",410,2

If you want a great Brazilian steakhouse I recommend Texas De Brazil.\n\nAfter talking with a person who dined with me, she said that the  chimichurri sauce was watered down with vinegar.

"3.5 Stars\n\nGot here about 7:15 on a Saturday night and as previously mentioned in a few reviews the place was almost empty. We were one of three parties. This made me nervous but I trust in yelp like I trust in google maps. If it says turn here.. i turn.. even if I wonder why.\n\nI was REALLY nervous when I took a look at the house pies. They were far from pretty or fresh. I had a group so we ordering a whole pizza.\n\nWe settled on:\n\nWhitestone Bridge(Tomato Sauce, Ricotta, Meatballs and Prosciutto):\nFirst thing I notice was that the crust was pretty thick for thin crust. Wasn't thick enough to be called anything else. It came out blistering hot but everything was holding together.\n\nWas time for that first bite.. was this going to be another tasteless crust Arizona \""ny style\"" pizza? Hrmmmm crunchy yet chewy. Wait... wait I taste something.. salty, yeasty.. ok cool the crust actually has a flavor. Wow this isn't half bad. The crust stood its ground until the last two pieces when crust failure set in at the very center of the pizza.\n\nThe mozzarella is high quality real cheese. The ricotta is sweet and creamy.  It had some caramelized onions on it which weren't listed as a topping but were a great addition. The meatballs were a-ok. Only thing I didn't like was the prosciutto because it wasn't real.. it was more of a salami. If it had been topped at the end with real paper thin prosciutto it would have been 4 stars easily.\n\nThe sauce was very thin the pie could have used maybe 1/4 more then it had. The sauce is pretty good a little on the sweet side. Nice strong fresh herb flavor.\n\nGarlic Knots(6 Twists of Pizza Dough Tossed in Herbs and Roasted Garlic Served with Marinara Sauce):\nSimple rustic preparation with a side of their sauce. No complaints other then a little on the over done side.\n\nThis place is good enough to add to the list of pizza places worth a return visit.",465,2
"I visited Wing Lei on Super Bowl Sunday quite frankly because of the the Michelin Star that it received in 2009. I called in the night before to make a reservation and the hostess at Wing Lei was sure to let me know how fantastic the restaurant was by naming all of the restaurants accolades. Needless to say, my expectations were sky high.\n\nBefore I get into the meat of the review, I think it is important to explain why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars. Given all of this restaurant's high level of achievement, I rated this restaurant against the very best restaurants that I have been to. It is quite obvious to me that if I were to rate and star Wing Lei against every other Chinese Restaurant in the United States, I would give it 4 or 5 stars without hesitation. \n\nHowever, with that said, here is why I was not so impressed with Wing Lei. Given the prestige of the restaurant, I found it appropriate to order the tasting menu offered by Chef Ming Yu. In true Michelin taste, there was a distinctly French flair to the menu that left the cuisine's Chinese authenticity in question. For instance, the first course of cold sea food was a prawn salad served with caviar, the soup dish was a truffle stuffed wonton soup, and subsequent dishes included duck, wagyu beef short ribs, and sea bass which were all plated and presented in a distinctly Western style. Although the tasting menu was for two people, none of the dishes were family style in the traditional Chinese sense, and there was a different glass of wine served for each course. It's not that Wing Lei takes a hit for having a French oriented tasting menu. The food was quite good and the sea bass was especially cooked to perfection. However, by serving a French style meal, the restaurant clearly opened itself up to a different standard of service that unfortunately falls short in my book. \n\nFirst and foremost, I was taken back the Maitre d's lack of knowledge, and even unwillingness to explain what was being served. For instance, the wagyu beef dish, was served without any explanation. It was not until I inquired about the dish, when a waiter explained that what I was eating was beef with vegetables. Likewise, each wine was served with very little explanation. A typical explanation was literally \""here is a red wine from France, 1999\"" or \""here is a desert wine from Hungary\"". Given that this menu featured a dessert white wine from Hungary, it seems clear to me that Chef Min Yu or his sommolier meticulously chose specific wines to accompany his dishes. The wait staff's lack of knowledge regarding both the food and the wine does not do this food justice especially because the chef takes an audacious and an uncharted approach to serving a French-Chinese fusion cuisine. A restaurant that attempts to serve food of this caliber must guide their customer through the whole culinary experience or else the customer will be left with a confused palate and more questions rather than pure satisfaction. Ultimately,  this meal left me wishing that I had just opted to go the traditional Chinese route (which the restaurant serves). \n\nIf you decide to dine at Wing Lei, here are my suggestions:\n-Forego the tasting menu and go the traditional route. \n\n-Looking at other reviews on Yelp, it is clear that you cannot go wrong with Wing Lei's Peking Duck.\n\n-You should not go out of your way to visit this restaurant just because they received a Michelin Star once upon a time. \n\nAfter all, I do not suspect that Wing Lei is far superior to other high end Chinese restaurants in town such as Empress Court at Caesars or Pearl at MGM. In any case, a visit to Wing Lei is certainly not a mundane experience. If your primary experience of Chinese food comes from Panda Express, expect to be wowed. If you frequent authentic Chinese restaurants and you forego the tasting menu, I think you will come away understanding that you are paying a generous premium for better quality food for a special occasion. Just don't eat at Wing Lei and expect it to be among the world's best restaurants.",858,2
"Am I taking crazy pills???!!!!! Four stars???? Really????  I think there needs to be some sort of quiz before being allowed to write reviews......  It could be as simple as: How many fingers am I holding up? Who was the first president of the United States?

No. But come on guys, call it what it is. This place is no better than an El Torito.

For example the okonomiyaki (which was like an explosion of heavenly goodness in my mouth. Sooooo good!). The interior design is lovely, but wish it wasn't so dark. Service is awesome!

Perhaps it was because there were so many people, or that they were restocking and pulling items out of the back whatever the deal...I was just overwhelmed. \n\nThe good news is that my friends ended up finding some cute dresses and blazers, so that's definitely a win. I left empty handed but I'd come back to check this place out again. I'm hoping for better luck next time.",236,2

"The manager contacted me after this post and offered to remake my meal. I found out they accidentally gave me crab instead of lobster the 1st time...hence the fishy smell. The second time around the steak was well prepared. Lobster was ok, not the best out there and not the worst. \n\nI ate there a 3rd time, and chose to dine in. The food overall was good. Had the Porterhouse topped with crab and asparagus, Parmesan & Truffle Matchstick Fries, Five Onion Soup, Double Chocolate Mousse. The porterhouse was alright, the server asked if we would like it a little blackened...I don't recommend this. It was burnt on the outside and it didn't help the steak. The crab and asparagus topping was very dry and the crab was definitely fishy again. The fries were average, however the five onion soup was one of the best french onion soups I have ever had. Would highly recommend it! The mousse was also really good!\n\nSo why 3 stars instead of 4 or 5? Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, etc  have a better steak...and overall their side dishes are better. Also, the atmosphere in the other restaurants are more upbeat and nicer decor.",259,2

"I was having a problem with my pit bull and I needed to bring it back to the rescue.  The large breed coordinator, Toni, was extremely harsh to me and degraded my character as a pet owner and then, actually recommended that I have the dog put down.  She even went so far as to provide me with a phone number to a veterinarians  office where I could have my dog put down.  Coming from a \""no-kill\"" rescue, I was appalled that their coordinator would actually suggest such a thing, especially after taking the time to personally tear me down and degrade my character as a dog owner over the phone.  Completely unprofessional.\nIt is challenging enough of a time to ultimately come to the decision to return my beloved dog to the \""rescue\"" but then to be treated this way was just completely unacceptable.

"I know that saying something negative about this place is like calling your baby ugly. With that said, I think we may have an ugly baby here. Don't get me wrong, there are some redeeming factors here, but for the most part I think that there might be a bit more hype than anything going on these days at La Grande.\n\nI went here for lunch today not recalling that 50% of their menu is not available 100% of the time and that kind of bummed me out because that means no pizza until 4 pm during the week unless it is Friday or Saturday and no burgers unless it is Friday or Saturday.  Either way, 11:15 am on Wednesday means I have a full choice of sandwiches, pastries, salads, and breakfast choices.  Many will say that those choices should be more than enough to choose from if I am willingly going to dine here.  Well...it wasn't my day to pick the lunch spot.  A work colleague actually picked it which is amusing due to my second gripe: between the loud music, gabbing hikers, lunching ladies on their way to or from the Biltmore or Fashion Square, the place doesn't necessarily lend itself to normal conversation.  That is assuming there is a place for everyone to sit. Just because you are alone, with your latte and laptop doesn't mean that you need to take up an entire 4 top to yourself.  The place itself and the atmosphere just doesn't feel as \""phoenix\"" as I recall when I first went. Something has changed. I feel like all of the LA transplants come here to recharge and then go off again to do their thing. It only made me laugh harder when I was leaving the restaurant and noticed the sign on the door that read \""LGO now open in Santa Monica.\"" Yahtzee! That is exactly where I thought I was anyways during lunch so I guess it makes sense that they opened another one out there.  I also think that the flow can be improved from finding parking, to the ordering, to the waiting at the end of the counter for your food, to finding a seat.  I would think for all the hassle I was going to get served a plate of food that was made from the water of the fountain of youth or at least a hint at the secret of life.  But alas my $8.00 tuna salad sandwich only came with a couple of pickles and a watermelon wedge.\n\nWhile I will say one of the redeeming is the food (although an $8.00 sandwich has to be pretty damn fantastic to be $8.00). My tuna salad on 9 grain was fresh, not too much mayo or other junk in it.. It is served with tomato, cucumber, apple and greens. I will be honest, the tuna is stacked high, but the bread is overly toasted and I hardly tasted the apple. But I repeat, the tuna salad itself was pretty good.\n\nI know when I first tried La Grande I liked it a lot. I thought the breakfast was great and I truly enjoyed the scene there. These days it just seems like it has lost a bit of it's luster for me. I am sure I will be back in the future and will give it another chance. It will probably be when I can get dropped off, have called in my order ahead of time and it is between the hours of 4 and 5 pm on a Friday so I can freely order from the entire menu.",727,2

Unsure as to whether or not we were even allowed to be driving there but unable to turn around, we continued on for a good 20 minutes.  We could see the casino the whole time but couldn't get to it.

"Was on another Vegas adventure and wanted to meet up with some friends for lunch.  They said, \""Let's go to Hash House.\"" Of course, I am not one to say no to a place I've never heard of, so we went. :] \n\nWhen we arrived during the lunch hours on that hot July Saturday, they said it would take up to 45 minutes for four people to be seated. RIDICULOUS! But, I was told it was worth the wait.  About a half hour later, we were seated and the menu was... insane.  I honestly had no idea what to select because everything sounded so...heavy.  I decided to go with one of their Saturday lunch specials - the Fisherman's Lunch.  It was a calamari steak sandwich and seafood sounded much lighter than double patties or chicken wrapped in eggs wrapped in only they know what!\n\nWhen the food arrived, I was in shock.  The servings are HUGEEEE.  I would recommend that people who are faint of heart to try and split something with another person.  Not a single person at my table cleaned off their entire plate; there was just too much!\n\nThe calamari steak was DELICIOUS.  I've never had anything like it before and it tasted WONDERFUL! The only problem was that the sandwich was so huge I had to take it apart just to eat it...which ended up being messy and leaving me with a calamari steak salad with very fresh croutons. :] As good as it tasted, I could not finish the entire plate! I even came in quite hungry! \n\nAdditionally, I had a taste of Andy N.'s chicken and I must admit... that was some pretty damn good chicken.\n\nOur server was a bit...eh. Nothing too exciting there.  He wasn't terrible, but he wasn't spectacular either.\n\nOverall, GREAT FOOD with HUGE PORTIONS!

Heck yeah - you made me buy an extra one - feel free to box one spring roll.\n\nThe service was pretty much like that the whole night.

The servers and bar tender are totally into it and are jovial while not ignoring their guests. We were seated at the bar and the bar tender had no problem answering questions and making recommendations while also cracking jokes to the trivia. The crowd (apparently thick tonight due to the 2hr delay tomorrow from the arctic vortex), was jovial and good spirited. Everyone cracked jokes, cheered, and made small talk if not entire conversations. There are 4-5 rounds to the trivia and the topics range from history to music to movies to pictures - a little something for everyone to flex their muscles.

"We ate here tonight in celebration of a family members birthday.  Unfortunately the quality of food makes me give this restaurant only 1 star.

The salad tasted like it came out of a plastic bag 2 minutes ago and was covered in Wishbone salad dressing (and I am sorry, that is a slam to Wishbone, that would have tasted better).  No freshly made salads or dressings in house I can guarantee you that.\n\nThe sourdough bread was definitely from a frozen loaf, it had this weird color/texture.  But, of all the food I had, this tasted the best (which isn't saying much).\n\nThe chicken parmesan was cooked fine, chicken moist, but it had the weirdest breading on it.  Totally tasted (again) that it came from frozen.

"** I'm reviewing the nightlife at Koi, not the restaurant.  **\n\nDuring our recent visit to Las Vegas my fianc\u00e9 & I went to Planet Hollywood.  Upon entering the hotel we were handed \""VIP\"" wristbands to their new club, Koi.  We were told that it was free entrance & ladies have open bar all night.

"There are some people who play magic the gathering (and similar games) who also maintain normal social lives, have girlfriends, and even shower regularly. You won't find any of this type of player among the staff of this shop. \n\nIt's hard for new players to get started in magic because there is a stigma about MTG players being rude, unfriendly, not sociable, and generally smelly. Such is my experience from the staff at the shop. And no wonder people don't want to try playing this game.\n\nSo let me tell you my story. I've played magic for a long long time (since around urza's saga), but just recently decided to get back into it heavily. A friend of mine and I went to this store to pick up some boosters and whatever, and just check it out because we've heard good things. He is also a brand new player.\n\nI think because I was wearing a collared shirt and was freshly shaven, the staff considered me some kind of menace or outsider, and avoided eye contact, no matter how long I stood at the counter ready to buy something, until I finally asked someone directly to help ring me up. I felt like a guy in a ski mask trying to buy cigarettes.\n\nWe came on a thursday, which was draft night, a format my friend and I were not familiar with at the time. HO-BOY was I sorry I asked for information about how draft works. It was such an effort for the guy at the counter (I think he was the owner) to explain it to me. Like I was asking him to do my taxes. He and his unwashed friends or employees (I couldn't tell who actually worked there) also made a couple snarky comments and giggled at my ignorance. \n\nSo how the shit are people supposed to learn to play? Don't these people want new opponents? Why must they try and alienate new players? Please, I would like to know.\n\nIf you work here, keep this in mind. There are people like me who, unlike you, haven't entirely given up on the opposite sex. That doesn't mean I'm not just as much of a nerd on the inside. Just like you, I'm going to go home after this and play 6-8 hours of video games. I'm going to order pizza because I'm too lazy to cook. I'm going to correct others about Star Wars trivia and wish that Firefly never ended. I'm going to explain to reluctant ears what I think Tom Bombadill represents and how I'm also sad he wasn't in the movies. I'm going to stay up all night writing code. \n\nSo can I play magic too?

"Okay. It's not in LA. It's in Vegas; same thing. Bradley Ogden is disappointing. The restaurant has a casual yet sophisticated decor. The food is straightforward. The main problem is that the food is very expensive relative to the actual value. \n\nFirst, the food is very uninspired American cuisine. Chef Ogden is a strong advocate for organic in-season produce. His cooking style is similar to Alice Waters of Chez Panisse fame. Unfortunately, this particular branch does not receive the same high quality produce that may be found in his other restaurants. Yet, the restaurant charges a premium for essentially glorified American cooking.\n\nI had the New Year's Eve Tasting Menu and it was underwhelming to say the least. Again, the food was uninspired. A factory might as well have been producing the food that evening. \n\nThe best thing that I ate was the complimentary butterscotch pudding with pumpkin seeds. That was dee-lish. The service was also lame. The dinner cost $800 for two! \n\nI would recommend Bradley Ogden for a quick bite and a glass of nice red wine at the bar. The restaurant is well suited for this.",248,1
"My brother and I stopped here in the half an hour interim between his soccer practice and my school's musical. I had heard good things, but was a little wary about it. I was wrong to have avoided it!\nWe walked in, and the menu was large and obvious right in front of us. My brother looked and looked for something he wanted, and finally settled on an option, but had originally had his heart set on a breakfast burrito. We got up to the register (no line, yay!) and I saw that they had breakfast burritos, but was unsure if they were still offering them at 6:30 PM. My brother asked (and he is very shy about asking people things, so he speaks quietly and a bit unsteadily) and the woman behind the register was incredibly patient and kind. \nHe got his breakfast burrito (eggs and bacon and nothing else in a tortilla, and he absolutely loved it) and I got a BLT burrito (which sounds odd, but is fantastic. Bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo) and everything was great.\nTheir seating area was cute, and had the patio not been under reconstruction, it would have been perfect to sit outside.\nGo to the Original Burrito Company, because the food is amazing and the staff are sweet. Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had!",281,3
"We were killing some time before jumping off the stratosphere and decided to have lunch here. Our waiter seemed uninterested in our service. I had a hard time understanding him due to his thick foreign accent. My wife had a philly cheesesteak which she said was awful...and my omelette was very bland... the cheese wasn't even melted. The manager seemed nice asking us how things were, but definitely wont go back.",88,1
"I have mixed reviews about this place.  My first experience was good.  I did have trouble locating the bar because it isn't directly off of 5th.  It is around the corner from CANS.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  It has modern decor, and everything seemed very hip.  I did not have any of the desserts but I did sample a few martinis.  They were all very yummy although not very strong.  If I'm paying $11 per drink, I like to get my money's worth!\n\nI decided to go back with some friends.  I was told that you needed reservations on Fridays and Saturdays.  I called on Friday at 9PM to make a 10PM reservation.  I was told they were no longer taking reservations, and that when I got there I would be placed on a waiting list.  I asked how long the wait was - and she mysteriously replied \""I can't tell you.\""  I laughed, in an UM, are you serious?? kind of way, and said \""Can you tell me if it's like 10 minutes or an hour?\""  She placed me on hold and when she returned I heard her asking a manager.  Who also said to tell me that she cannot tell me how long the wait is.  Needless to say, I was pretty irritated.  We didn't go there that night, and I don't plan to return in the near future.  My time is just as important as anyone else's.  I really didn't appreciate that BS.",334,2
This place lacks everything.. The food is disgusting. I threw up after I ate there food. It's just not good. It's sucks because Arizona lacks culture foods. Id rather go to Panda Express than step foot in that place.,50,1
Went here for the lunch buffet/early dinner last week and overall I was disappointed right from the get go. First of all I waited in line for what seemed forever because the hostess was to busy talking to a co-worker and was actually eating something. Once I got past that I went to the table where it took a good 10 to 15 min for them to bring out a iced tea. As far as the food that I had the crab legs where decent there just wasn't a lot of meat but I expected that for a lunch buffet. However I had to really look around to find anything else that was edible and really didn't have any success. The seafood other than the crab legs and shrimp looked bad. The Italian food looked like it had been sitting all day. The American station wasn't appealing at all. They did have flank steak on the craving station but I didn't try that because I had some kind of other beef from the middle Eastern station and it was really tough. The desserts where awful took a couple and just took a bite and threw them away. Also the whole time I was there nobody came to pick up plates and the whole section I was in was the same way. I think there are better options than eating here and I probably wouldn't go back.,267,1
Beautiful by day and night.  Luminaries and Chihuly are a must see!!  Makes for a very nice evening!,27,4
"Quick, cheap, and great!\n\nI can't believe I have not reviewed this place before.  I go there all the time.\n\nFirst of all, it isn't easy to find.  You have to go to the Asian mall at the corner of sugar creek in Tryon.  The parking lot is rough, I mean ROUGH!  Pot holes everywhere, some mangled speed bumps as well.  The mall looks pretty ghetto too, but I don't know of any crime there.  Once you drive by all the stores you'll probably notice a pho place, a few grocery stores, and some nail salons, but no banh mi.  You actually have to go up in this run down mall.  The best entrance is towards the end away from Tryon.  Go in about a hundred feet and you'll see Le's on the right.\n\nIts sooooo good.  There\""s an easy to identify menu with numbers.  Always ask for it on a baguette, its like 50-75 cents more but you get a whole lot more food.  I suggest trying them all, but I normally go for the combo or the pate.  Pay the extra little bit for pate regardless of which sandwich, it makes it.  The pickled veggies are extremely crunchy but watch out, sometimes there is an extra large chunk of hot pepper in there.\n\nThey have bubble tea, some Gatorade and a couple other offerings as far as drinks go.  There\""s a few small tables, but I normally take mine to go.\n\nNot really that much else to say, just go, you won't be disapointed.",355,4
"Christine at the west location gives the best massage ever! Her energy is amazing and that is what you need an exchange of light and wellness, along with excellent touch, Christine F you rock!\nThanks !!",42,4
"Amazing! The food and the service were out of this world excellent. \n\nMichael and Javier were servers for our table and both did a terrific job. Michael was very friendly, entertaining, professional, and enthusiastic. \n\nThe French Onion soup is very good and the steak I had was terrific. The tiramisu was fabulous! One person in my group had the Bananas Foster custard and he raved over that as well.\n\nConsider making reservations if you have a large party or going to dinner during peak hours. Did I mention the tiramisu?\n\nExpect a large bill. There were four of us dining each had a glass of wine or cocktail, split an appetizer, and all had steak dinners. The final tally was over $400 plus gratuity. \n\nI would DEFINITELY go here again..!",176,4
"This place is falling apart. Literally... The huge disco ball fell from the ceiling as we were watching a concert. The bathrooms are disgusting and everything needs a good cleaning. With that said it's a nice small venue to see a band, with great acoustics!\n\nWe did not eat or drink downstairs so I cannot comment about that.",71,1
Ehhhhh I wasn't impressed. First of all what irritated me the most is that they stamped me like three time and gave me a wrist band.. do I freaking need all of that?? NO!! They had a couple rooms I was in two of them. The first room played a mixture of top 40 and hip hop but I didn't like that the dj would play it for 30 seconds big boo on that. It was large but not one of the great clubs in vegas. This place only gets a half thumbs up,111,2
"I ordered cupcakes for a baby shower that I was throwing and I could not have been more pleased!! Not only were they beautiful, but the taste was divine! Everyone was asking where they were from and I was happy to share my new find and recommend Sweet Affairs.  With all the cupcakes places popping up on every corner, I've been disappointed over and over again. I'm so happy to have found this wonderful company!",88,4
"I love Cana's mojitos which are muddled with fresh fruit and real sugar cane. I've also tried the caparinha which is also really good. Every time my friends and I come here, we either get the empanadas, beef tenderloin, slider dogs, classico ceviche, tuna ceviche, or the fish tacos.\n\nHappy Hour prices are amazing. You can eat pretty well for fairly cheap. The service has ALWAYS been excellent here.",97,3
"Pizza is fantastic but be sure to order the classic crust. The thin crust is not as good as the nellos classic. \n\nVery fast service, and my favorite pizza joint in town. The classic cheese you can't go wrong with but order up a sausage pepperoni and you will be in heaven.",65,3
Terrible food. I ordered a Buffalo Chicken wrap and they gave me lettuce and chicken and squirted some Buffalo sauce on it. Nothing that cannot be done at home in less than 5 mins. It's worse than subway and more expensive.,50,0
"I ate at Nakama for the first time last night, sat at the sushi bar with two friends, ordered a ton of food, and an expensive bottle of sake (which was over priced and soso in quality). Despite the money we dropped, the service was horrible, simply put; unprofessional, rude, and snotty.\n\nNow, this place has nothing to be uppity about: THEY DO NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT SUSHI IS. It was Americanized to the extreme, the menu was embarrassing, as with the wine and sake list. The sashimi was so poorly cut you could barley chew on it, the maki was not tightly rolled. And the fish... oh the fish, no flavor.\n\nThe hipster crowd should of tipped me off, this is place for people who do not know anything about dining, and probably only eat sushi because they think it's the cool thing to do. The crowd was nothing but meat heads and trashy looking girls, the music selections we're bottom of the barrel, and the blaring sports tv's would ruin anyones dinner who cares.",229,0
friendly and fast! but they are in need of a remodel.,14,2
"Lisa H especially turned me on to this place: I finally made it by myself and as soon as I stepped in the door, I wished I had more time to spend here. \n\nCoffees, teas, smoothies, and juices coexist peacefully together on the menu, and the dining room has shelves of books, newspapers, and games, just in case you don't have a device to take advantage of their free wifi. Basically, it's your best friend's living room, if your friend knew how to make a million drinks and had a pastry case handy.  \nIn short, this place has everything you could need to spend hours in a coffee shop with friends or solo. The staff are so friendly here, they'll probably end up your friends within a visit or two.\n\nThe Grouchy John is their namesake coffee drink for a strong and delicious reason, but if it's too late in the day for caffeine just ask for their Shirley Temple of Doom- a blended matcha green tea drink with maraschino cherries. Part dessert, part smoothie, all uniquely tasty.",227,3
"Lifestyles of the (not) Rich & Shameless.\n\nYou know life is good when you're wading in the Temple pool, water falling down from the fountain above, massaging your head & shoulders, cooling off from the dry Las Vegas heat.  \n\nMy stay was at the new Octavius Tower, which recently opened at the beginning of the year.  The Augustus & Octavius Towers have a separate entrance & lobby, which successfully segregates VIP' s like me (LOL) from the plebs staying at the more economical Palace Tower.  Early check-in was a breeze, and I was soon on my way to room 6278.  \n\nRoom - OMFG!  This is nice!  2 queen beds with 4 pillows & a bolster greeted us as we walked in.  A large, flat-screen TV w/ media hub, a Keurig coffeemaker, well appointed minibar & couch were available to peruse at our leisure.  The carpeting was nice & soft, and the room window had a pretty decent view of the Bellagio fountains next door.  \n\nThe bathroom was spectacular!  There were dual sinks w/ another flatscreen TV, a whirlpool bath and a separate shower w/ a rainfall showerhead & glass door.  I drew a couple hot baths during my stay and enjoyed soaking my old man body, with the jets seemingly making all my worries go away.  The complimentary bath products were Gilchrist & Soames Qua Bath & Spa.  It could be the just the fancy packaging, but they seemed luxuriant.  \n\nPool - The Temple Pool is gorgeous.  Forget going in the afternoon, because it's literally shoulder-to-shoulder.  All someone can do is stand & pee.  I made sure to head to the pool the next day when it opened at 8am.  About 30 patrons had the same idea, but fortunately, they were concerned with confiscating pool chairs for sunbathing.  I had the circular Temple Pool all to myself for around 20 mins, in which I swam and waded underneath 1 of the 4 fountains as described earlier. Great way to cool off.  \n\nComplimentary coffee & tea is offered at the Augustus/Octavius lobby during the hours of 7-9 in the morning.  Bonne Maman honey from France is offered in individual mini-jars, of which I have about 10 here at home awaiting for my disposal.  Hey, it's free!  Don't judge!  Across the lobby is a Starbucks in case you don't fancy the free stuff.  BTW, Starbucks located in hotels/casinos don't offer free WiFi.  Bummer.\n\nExpress checkout was a breeze.  I reviewed my bill on the flat-screen TV, confirmed checkout and left the room keys in the room.  \n\nI had the time of my life.  I felt like a foreign diplomat on my way to meet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton over cucumber sandwiches to discuss diplomacy.  If you have the money to burn, I recommend staying at Caesar's Palace and re-enact your own \""Hangover\"".\n\nGood times.\n\nExcelsior!",690,4
"Not Impressed!!! Read some of the other reviews of this place and thought I would still give them a try. Yelpers were right, to cool to help you out, would rather BS with each other and not help anybody out. Walked around their very small place for about 20 minutes, looking in their cases, NOT A WORD to me asking me if I'd like to look at anything. Twice I have gone in this place and just think their Customer Service is just AWFUL!",103,1
"I went there for the first time on yesterday to order out. I knew it was going to be busy since Sunday is football, but surprisingly I was able to order pretty fast. My order wasn't anything crazy just wings for myself and some friend also ordered fries and a kids meal. The amount came out to less then I was expecting. After ordering I sat and watched the game about 20 minutes later one of the employees told me the cook messed up the order and it would be another 3 minutes. About 10 minutes later my food came out and the manger came over to me. She apologized for the wait and gave me a $10 off coupon. I appreciated that she noticed but the time I waited wasn't the problem. I walked across the parking lot to my work with the food. I opened everything up and it was cold. So did they really messed up my order or was it just sitting there because everyone was busy?",195,1
"Had the Coney dog- Vienna hotdog with no bean chili n onions..

I beg to differ.",76,1
"I love this place! One of my fave sandwich places! They bake their own bread and the sandwiches are fantastic! The prices are awesome but beware it's because they are CASH ONLY so make sure you bring some skrilla with you and no plastic! The place is big plenty of seating in and out. They also have ice cream, shakes, and morning baked yummy goods! Mmmm",79,3
"My friends and I used to visit District fairly often for happy hour but ever since they changed their bar menu, we all agreed we won't be coming back any time soon. Last time we went, we all ordered the mac and cheese, the pretzel bites, and Kobe beef sliders. The mac and cheese and pretzel were items we had enjoyed munching on in the past while having some beers, so we were sorely disappointed with what eventually came out. \n\nThe mac and cheese had a familiar taste and it didn't take long for us to figure it out: Hamburger helper with cheese puffs. Listen, I'm not hating on hamburger helper but it's not exactly what I want when I go to an \""upscale\"" bar for happy hour. The pretzel bites which were once warm, soft, and chewy chunks of pretzels were replaced by thinly sliced, toasted pieces of pretzel. Think brushcetta only with pretzels. Neither soft nor crunchy, it just lacked any textural identity, which made it all the more disappointing. Oh and the sliders...they looked like two average sliders for $10. \n\nHonestly it felt like the chef decided to get a little cutesy with the menu. I'm not against presentation but when it's paired with mediocre food and shrinking portions, it looks all the more ridiculous.",279,1
"What a TERRIBLE experience!!!!!! The first time I went to this Jamba Juice location I walked in expecting to be greeted by the cashier and was shocked when I didnt even receive a simple hello or smile. The young kid just looked at me as if I was nonexistent! I was right in front of him! Then, when I ordered a cold buster he said, \""I have no idea what that is.\"" He grabbed one of his coworkers and the woman who was helping him said, \""You really don't know what that is, are you kidding me?!\"" Not a way to treat a customer OR a coworker. Very rude. Today, I decided to give it one more try, as I do work nearby. I walked in only to find that the cash registers weren't working and they were only able to accept cash (understandable, things happen). That was NOT what frustrated me. I was frustrated when I ordered a smoothie and the woman (Aldea?) started laughing at me and seemed to be extremely sidetracked on the customer behind me. I had to repeat the order multiple times in between her giving her attention to another customer rather than mine and joking with her coworker (blonde with long hair). After repeating myself several times she responded, laughing,  \""I have no idea what's going on right now.\"" I didn't think it was a difficult task, I was just trying to order a smoothie.... To top it off, when the smoothie was finally given to me the blonde behind the counter snidely handed it to me and said \""The color's a little off.\"" That happens to be a statement, not a solution. Completely unnecessary. \n\nBeyond unprofessional, employees greatly lack customer service skills, VERY disappointed. Sticking to Starbucks across the way!",364,0
"After trying on wedding gowns next door, my group was in the mood for Mexican food.. UGH! NOOO! Ive got a gown to fit in to! I love the decor.. The staff was friendly.. The food.. was, so so.. I found the chips on the greasy.. as in.. greasy fingers side.. The salsa was great.. and my enchiladas were nothing amazing.. almost watery.. I dont think its nice to have to ask for app plates for my chips and salsa.. but we had to, because I thot it was ridiculous to be using napkins! \nOur waiter seemed off kilter when asked to split the check.. oh well.. so so.. is a 2 too..",146,1
"I used to come in here a few times a week. The staff is friendly, the food is pretty good, and the prices are mediocre. For lunch, I only go if I like the special that day because it's a very good deal. Their breakfast is also pretty tasty. \n\nUnfortunately, I have pretty much stopped going at all since probably 5 out of the last 7 times I have been in they are out of what I order or at least an ingredient in what I order. It is extremely frustrating and has really caused me to stop going as I don't want to go out of my way to get there only to be told they don't have the items on their menu. this usually happens at breakfast and I think it's because they wait on a truck to bring them items from their other location every morning and sometimes it doesn't get there until later but either way it has caused them to basically lose me as a customer unless absolutely necessary. I would recommend as long as you are flexible on what you want to eat that day.",220,2
"Went here for my birthday dinner, I had the Hot and Messy roll which was $16, this is the most expensive sushi roll I have ever ordered. While it was delicious, including the scallop on top and warm tempura roll, it was not spectacular which is what I was hoping for. My dinner companion ordered the chinese dish of walnut shrimp. The portion was small for the price but it was good, not great for $15. Last week I had a bite of my son's crab roll off the kid's menu, it was pretty good for $2. The adult  prices are  high and you are paying for the ambiance, the decor and layout of the restaurant are gorgeous. Too bad the food is just so-so. Not sure if I will return, I have had better sushi from the Fry's sushi bar for $9 a roll.",180,2
"This was the last meal we ate in Vegas because we were sick of eating buffets by then. Didn't do any research on non-buffets so we came here at the recommendation of my aunt. Place was a little hard to find because the signs at the Venetion/Palazzo weren't too helpful. Even though the casino was packed there was no line when we went in so we were seated almost immediately. The waiter forgot to bring us bread so we didn't get any until after our main courses arrived. I ordered the Sunday night pasta, which is basically spaghetti but with steak and short ribs in it instead of ground beef. Don't get me wrong it was pretty good, but not really something I would pay $15 dollars for. You can't really tell the meat is better since the pasta sauce has a stronger taste. My dad's dish, on the other hand, was excellent. He ordered the slow roasted short ribs and they were fantastic, full of flavor, juicy, and tender. This place really deserves 3.5 stars but I guess I'll bump it to 4 since the decor is pretty nice.",236,3
This is WAY off strip so if you wnt to go to the strip dont stay here.. If you dont care about that then the hotel is nice and the rooms were clean. They have a security guard at the elevator so no riff raff will find its way upstairs. There is a 7-11 close so you can stock up on supplies cause the cocktail service on the casino floor is pretty non-existant. The slots arent as loose as they should be for the casinos location.The place is smokey YES but it is a casino and it is about average in smokeyness compared to strip hotels.. The food is a lot less expensive as the strip and is a pretty good value.. The lunch buffet is $7.99 and it is a huge spread..,156,2
"This place is an interesting, ecclectic collection of things ranging from furniture, to fake plants, to groceries - all of which are quite pretentious.  Many, if not all of the items have international flare, presumably the driving force behind the store's name, and many of the items are hard-to-find elsewhere.\n\nIt's not cheap to shop here, but that's the price you pay for exclusivity.  They also have an option to sign up for their World Market rewards program that will save you 10% on your first purchase, which would definitely come in handy if you're in the market for an antique looking piece of furniture.\n\nOverall, it's a fun store, with lots of nifty things to look at.  Much of what's there appears to be of high quality as well, so certainly a nice place to visit on a rainy day.",188,2
"Been here several times, always have a great time.\nGreat food, Great Service, and of course Great local beer selection.\n\nWhile is does get noisy from time to time, I still find it a great place to take a date.\n\nIntroduced many people into the world of beer here, and plan to continue!",70,4
"Went for lunch with my wife who works in the area. The place was loud & crowded. We waited 10 minutes to be seated and the service went downhill from there. I ordered a beer, server asked for my ID, which I handed him, and he ran off with it (I assumed to check it). 5 minutes later he returns with my ID but not my beer! I finally got my beer shortly after. \n\nThe food is overpriced and marginal at best. It seems like it is a place to go to be seen as long as you don't care about mediocre food at a Biltmore district price. \n\nWhen we were ready to leave, we waited for the bill. Then waited some more. Then more waiting. The group of 4 next to us at the table was in the same boat - where is our server & our bill? I finally got up, walked over to the manager & asked for our bill and the bill for the party next to us. He of course apologized. We paid, which took the server way too long to process, and left. \n\nI will not be back & I doubt the party next to us will be either.",250,0
"Worst experience ever at a bar... \n\nMy friend and I stopped by after grabbing lunch elsewhere in the marketplace. We had just order our first beer and started talking to a couple at the bar next to us. The guy jokingly attached 4 straws together and was trying to drink out of his dates cup. The bartender grabbed the straws, pulled them apart and threw them away without making any eye contact with any of us. \nShocked, we told her she was very rude, and that it was completely uncalled for. She immediately cut all four of us off and told us to leave. \nWe asked for the manager, who was in his early thirties, overweight and a complete underachieving nerd named Ryan. He said he stands behind his waitresses regardless of what happened. I told him I would ruin him on yelp and he replied, \""yelp is worthless, nobody reads it anyway.\"" \nOther than that, the bottled beer tasted fresh.",200,0
"Uh, I am not mad that my whole family can eat for under $50! I am not mad that there is finally a Golden Corral in Las Vegas. Although if I am being all the way honest, I am a bit mad they put it on the east side. Come on, the ghetto will travel for a $12 buffet I promise. But at the same token, the lonely ol' east side that I grew up on needed some good food. Hopefully when you dine, the crowd will be a bit more pleasant. \nMy bf and I decided to try it for lunch (please don't tell my kids). Our total was under $20, so instant score in my opinion. They also offer sweet tea. Double score.\nYou wait in line to pay, and get drinks before reaching a cashier. Somewhat silly because if the waitresses aren't up on game, it is a bit hard to get a refill. Plus, it holds up the line a bit. For lunch the selections were not bad at all! Pasta, pizza, meatloaf, fish, fried chicken, a few Asian choices, and a small salad area. The desserts section was big, but the chocolate fountain didn't look all that sanitary so I skipped. It is a perfect height for kids (with no sneeze guard) to walk right up and stick their dirty little, bug eating, butt picking fingers right in it! And I watched plenty un-supervised kids do exactly that. Don't take this the wrong way, there is a sneeze guard, but not if you are under 4 feet tall! The ambiance really reminded you that you were eating on Charleston and Lamb and I was really hoping they would avoid that. But honestly it was the people eating, not watching their kids, getting every possible bang for the buck they could, that set the tone. \nI will return, mostly to let the kids try it. We will see how that experience goes and then decide if I will continue to dine.",411,2
"DONT go there. As usual for us, in Las Vegas, we are renting a car. What the FOX people don't tell you is that they are not in the rental center, but 5 miles away and that you have an average wait for a car of 3 hours. We quickly jump into the bus back to enterprise.",69,0

"I'm writing this as I wait....we arrived at 10:30pm, got seated by the manager who came from the bar area because hostess was busy talking story.  After 20 minutes at our little booth for 6 people, we were about to leave but a server finally comes to take our drink order. When we mentioned to server that we were about to leave, she apologized and gave an excuse of a server got \""cut\"", so she will be starting our drink order. Decided to stay. Another server came 10 minutes after our drinks arrived to take our food order. Finally at 11:30pm, we are eating...yay! Food is good. Our table had a couple burgers, rib eye steak, chicken alfredo, and a salmon salad. Looking around our table, there are no complaints about the food. Server had no name tag, so I had to ask for his name. His name is Eric. There is only around table and another table of people right now, so I don't understand why service is so BAD! So long story, short...food is good but service is HORRIBLE! PEOPLE BEWARE!!!!!",243,0
"This Walgreens is on a power trip.  I've never had any problem in Nevada or Vegas for that matter buying alcohol with just one ID but for some reason this Walgreens requires two.  Don't tell me it's state law when NO ONE else has EVER required it.  I am well over the age of 21 and am appalled at the way I was treated.  Regardless of whether I had an ID or not, I could have very easily just relined up and made another purchase of alcohol without the second person in line and Walgreens would have had to sell me the liquor.  Seems like some rude ass behavior for Walgreens.  I can buy hookers in nevada but I cant buy alcohol? Yea. GET OFF YOUR POWER TRIP WALGREENS",157,0
"I have heard people say this place is food coma central. Came here after a night of fun and decided to get some food. \n\nFood: \nSage fried chicken and waffle. This was a huge plate and what felt like a mountain of food, but that did not intimate me. I was ready to dig in and was definitely impressed. The flavor was good and everything worked well together.  roscoe chickens and waffle is definitely better in my book. This dish was around $15- 16 and i think it is worth your money to try this place once. \n\nService\nWe were seated pretty quickly, but then again it was 4 am.

Unfortunately, the cost for just too high. Even if I left my husband at home, it would still be too FAR expensive for my daughter and I to go. The chances of us going back any time soon are pretty remote. I have heard other families (some of whom have two or more kids) say the same thing. The expense is just too great.",111,2
"In between a 4 and 4.5\n\nThe last time I was in Vegas was several years ago when they were BUILDING the Wynn, so it I suppose it's only fitting that my first visit after a 4+ year hiatus be at the hotel that wasn't even open when I was here last.  It's almost as if they had built the hotel for me and my first visit was long overdue.  But that's just wishful thinking.\n\nThe Wynn being one of Vegas' more recent hotels, there are a few aspects of the hotel that follow an architectural pattern with some of the other newer hotels.  Take the parking garage for example.  Instead of parking garages where you go round and round as you ascend multiple levels of parking, the ramp to climb each level is on the exterior of the structure so the interior resembles more that of a supermarket parking lot.  Why I'm spending so much time talking about the parking structure I have no idea.\n\nWalking into the casino.... Oh look, slot machines!  Poker tables!  Scantily clad cocktail waitresses!  All these (and more) you will find in just about any casino, old or new, in Las Vegas.  *sigh* What a life....\n\nMy friend was able to score an upgrade up to the 52nd floor.  Yes, you heard me... FIFTY TWO.  All 3 of our rooms had great views.  The room I was in specifically had a view of the strip, and while the other 2 rooms were on the other side of the hotel, their room were overlooking a golf course.  The rooms were standard: bed, sofa and ottoman, wall-mounted flat screen TV, desk with a video phone and fax machine, and books and booklets detailing the room and resort amenities.  The bathroom had separate shower and bathtub, dual sinks with a vanity in between, a small wall TV, and a segregated toilet with a phone.  Hey, it solves the problem of answering the phone call while you're seated on the throne.  I'm just saying.\n\nI don't have to tell you that the hotel overall is just gorgeous.  The theme of the brown and gold exterior of the hotel seamlessly transports itself to the color scheme inside.  The layout of the casino and surrounding areas is not complicated to navigate and makes everything seem easily accessible.  All of the dealers I dealt with were nice, patient and courteous, except for maybe the late late hours when they're not as talkative and would probably prefer being in bed instead of handing out winnings at the craps tables.  Yes, I found my new poison of choice at the casino: craps.  I never understood the game up until this trip when a couple of my friends explained a few basics and I experienced some beginner's luck.  One session I had started with $30 and within an hour, I had quadrupled my money.\n\nWe did have a chance to experience any of the fine restaurants here at the Wynn, which include Mario Batali's Bartolotta or Daniel Boulud Brasserie.  We did however eat at their buffet for brunch for one of our meals (review to come).\n\nWould I stay here again?  Well, not unless I scored some sort of deal or promo (which my friend did) or we were in a larger group, like we were, bringing down the room cost for everybody.",724,3
"I was here on a random Friday afternoon.  It was okay, a different experience than I usually have, but I probably won't come back any time soon.  There were very few people here with us, so the waitress was around to check more frequently than I'm sure she would have if it was during a peak time.  The draft and bottle lists are unimpressive, but it'll get the job done.  They have a pretty decent liquor selection, but I can only image the price here.\n\nI had a few of their nachos off their nachos to share plate and they were a nice, thick chip with some non-descript lettuce, tomatoes, cheese sauce, and a few jalapenos.  There were small sides of salsa and sour cream.  I'm used to a big mess on the plate, but these were actually fairly neat to eat - I almost missed the soggy reject chips that are always left on nacho plates because that means the first ones were the perfect balance of crisp and gooey.  They also ran out of grilled chicken, so we had to substitute chicken tenders.  I'm wondering why, since it was SO packed (read: not at all), they ran out, but it happens.\n\nRedeeming points: Big Buck Hunter.  My boyfriend and his friend selected this place because they have an ongoing competition.",286,1
"Bone-in ribeye - a bit tough, Outback/Saltgrass quality.  \n\nAsparagus - decent seasoning, unspectacular.\n\nFried mac n' cheese - the Texas State Fair could beat it out.\n\nMashed potatoes (menu calls it something else) - best item ordered, too bad it was one fifth of the proper serving.\n\nNice server.  Food came as slow as molasses.  iPad drink menus.  Whoopie.\n\nFour stars if $15-20/head, I paid $65 with one drink.  Not a happy camper for value received.  As a douchey doorman once told me, welcome to Vegas!",150,1
"To be fair, this review is based only on the CFS, as we both had it. The best way to describe it is \""Quantity over Quality. It is way, way WAY overrated.  We saw the chicken fried steak review in the Arizona Republic's annual Roundup of the best in Arizona and went to try it out. The CFS is itself pretty ordinary, but then, how good can CFS be? Is a pretty simple dish made from a cheap cut of meat. The accompanying mashed potatoes were just okay. I must say that the coleslaw is the best I've ever had. \n\nThe portions are over the top gigantic. There is no way a normal person can eat this meal: for $14 you get two absolutely enormous pieces of meat covered in breading and smothered in cream gravy. As a result, there was a lot of waste-we paid attention, and didn't see a single person come close to finishing their meal. Of course, a lot of people then take it home, but warmed up chicken fried steak? Really? The waitress agreed that they serve way too much food-she said they often suggest to management just serving one piece of meat, But for some reason they don't, except for lunch. I guess they prefer to make their contribution to America's obesity problem. \n \nWe arrived 6PM  Friday night and had a short, 10 minute wait. They only take reservations for 6 or more.",305,1
"My hubby and I came here for brunch and it was delightful.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because our server was less than excited to be at work and I am pretty sure he was hungover....but the food more than made up for it.  We started with a bacon date scone, we wanted the cinnamon roll but they were all out.  The scone was delicious. My husband had the iron skillet pancake which was beyond amazing!  I wanted the eggs benedict, but they were out of that as well, so I had the biscuit and gravy and it was really good.  For dessert we shared the sticky toffee pudding and it was wonderful.  We will definitely return!",148,3
"More of an American restaurant with Chinese dishes.  The Dan Dan Noodles (Mien) were truly \""ma ma-hoo-hoo\"" (so-so in Mandarin) with some of the noodles still stick together from the packaging.  Not so good!  The flavors were not bad and the sliced cucumber is a nice addition.\n\nNice wait staff.  Pleasant dining room.  Cool Happy Hour.  So they get 3 stars for effort and ambience.  I'll keep trying the dishes and report more later.  For LV residents looking for Chinese food, go to Spring Mountain!",124,2
"YOU! I've been looking for you.\n\nIt's unfortunate I stumbled upon you after eating a filling Laotian meal, but I was able to find room after hearing about your desserts.  And also a little extra for some wine.\n\nWe got:\n\nSicilian Sfingi:  I know, you're all like buhh? But they're essentially chocolate beignets with a hint of orange.  So soft, hot and fresh with a healthy drizzle of chocolate.\n\nStrawberry Rhubarb Lavender Pie with Honey Ice Cream: Feel free to read that over as many times as you like.\n\nWhen the server came over and asked how everything was, my cousin found it within herself to shout, \""HOLY SHIT\"".   He responded saying that best thing she could have said.\n\nIt's communal tables, so mind your elbows and talk to you neighbors!  It's a really fantastic menu, and flawless service for such a young restaurant.\n\nAnd do I need to mention how glorious the name is?\n\nMay the pig be with you.",237,4
"Best eye care I have received so far. I made my appt. online and went the next day.\n\nThe moment I walked in the door I was greeted with a smile and offered not only coffee or water but also hot chocolate or chai tea, talk about kickin' it up a notch! When I had a question , it was answered in lay terms and when I was trying on frames my assistant gave me options and opinions... honest ones.\n\nThey have a fabulous selection of classic and retro frames from top designers and a stylish array for the kiddos.\n\nI highly recommend 3 Guys for all of your optical needs.",135,4
"Casey's totally transports you from being on campus all day into completely forgetting about anything that happened on campus that day.  It's a great little hang out for the college scene. Very close for those on the west side of campus, so close a group of us sometimes heads over between classes or at the end of a rough day to grab a drink and some grease. \n\nSo needless to say I have had a few of the items on the menu however, I haven't found something I really, really like. I've had the tuna bacon melt (overkill-too much grease), fries (yum, they put a sprinkle of parmesan), fried clams (good), turkey croissant (okay), zucchinis and mushrooms (good). \n\nI think the patio really makes this place great. It is fun and welcoming. You could hang out here all day (in great weather that is).  They allow smoking, kinda sucks, but most people are respectful and blow up rather than at you. If you go during peak hours (weekends/nights) you might not be able to get a table as most people make a looooooong night of Casey's and usually stay put. Cheers!!!",251,3
"st. francis, you are the most frustrating place in phoenix to me. i am always so pleased with the food but horrified by the service. \nthat's right, horrified. \ni have been here four times, in hopes this was some kind of sick fluke, but no, this is not the case. \nhowever, the food is fantastic. the brunch is a wonderful spring day event. but be prepared to sit at your table without a drink for 15 minutes and to not place your order for another 30 minutes, even if you feel like it isn't busy, the service will not improve.",130,1
"Glendale Native seems to want to make a change for the better, new menu, new don't cook it until you order it - but what the heck - no ribs, no steak, no specials on Saturdays? And how can plain home syle potato chips cost the same as the loaded Buffalo Chips? Many waitresses and waiter need to take lessons from Jessica. This place still needs to make major improvements on the front greeting desk - they stil seem clueless many times.",96,2
hahaha.  can someone call the fire marshal.\n\nit's packed.  packed liked sardines packed.\n\ni couldn't figure out how to make it from one end of the building to the next.\n\ni am relatively polite.  i understand that when they push n shove.  it's only love (ice cube - we be clubbin)\n\nbut this was ridiculous.\n\ni had to have some girl (thank you miss.  whoever you are) grab me by the arm and bulldoze her way through the crowd for me.\n\nthis place had the potential to be great.  but sadly.  no.\n\nin two words.  crowd control.\n\nfor this review.  two stars.,162,1

"I recently went with my two favorite guys to the Original Pancake House on a Sunday morning. \n\nWe showed up at around 11am and were able to park without a problem. The parking lot is very small, but on our trip only 3 other cars were there.\n\nWe immediately noticed the \""cash only\"" sign on the door. What kind of place still takes cash only? Especially in Scottsdale, next to the Fashion center, and it's a place that charges $10 for pancakes????\n\nFortunately there is a cash machine across the street. Once we got our cash we were able to get a table without waiting. I guess that should have been our clue to what type of food/service we were going to receive.\n\nAfter looking for over 7 years in Arizona for a breakfast place that serves potato pancakes and dutch pancakes I was pretty excited about trying this place out. The ambiance in this place leaves much to be desired, but I wasn't going to complain if the food was good.\n\nWell, the food and service definitely weren't good.....\nOur server came to take our order, and it was clear she didn't speak any English. Luckily, one of my guys speaks Spanish and was able to relay our order. \n\nWe ordered the Dutch Baby, an order of Potato pancakes, a Cheese omelet, and 3 diet cokes.\n\nI nearly laughed when they brought us 3 cans of soda and a glass of ice cubes. What kind of place doesn't have a soda machine? And secondly, you get no refills. Bad news for someone who drinks 15+ glasses of diet coke while eating out like my friend does! (He makes sure to get his moneys worth!).\n\nWe waited nearly an hour for our food. When it finally came it was clear that they had timed our order wrong and put all our food in at the same time. The omelet was ice cold, the pancakes were soggy, the dutch baby was pipping hot. Hmmm.....\nOur waitress?? No where to be found.\n\nWe decided to just eat our food. The omelet was probably the best of what was offered, even though it was ice cold. There was a good amount of cheese, and it was a large portion. It also came with a side of pancakes, which were ok, but really just average pancakes. Not too much different from Denny's. Certainly not what you would expect from a restaurant named \""Original Pancake House\"".\n\nThe potato pancakes were dismal. Soggy, sad, little things that made me nearly cry for my old Minnesota breakfast hangouts. The applesauce was muscleman's brand, which seemed to cheapen the pancakes even more.\n\nThe dutch baby, which I had been so excited about was an eggy mess. Dutch pancakes are usually served while still puffy, this one had fell flat 5 minutes ago. It said on the menu it would come with a lemon butter side. I was served butter in a dish and a slice of lemon. Very disappointing.\n\nOver all, the breakfast wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was just ok. I realize my expectations were very high. I wouldn't go again, and I wouldn't recommend it. I guess if you are staying at the attached Motel 6 it would probably be a good choice for a quick, filling meal.\n\nIf you are looking for a better quality breakfast I would recommend Butterfield's. More ambiance, much better food, the take credit cards, and the prices are much more reasonable.",763,1
Trini is great; he listens and gives you exactly what you want.  Or tells you why it wouldnt work.,25,4

They are friendly and accommodating.",75,4
"I hate to do this to you Rio, I really do. But our relationship has been souring for years now and I think it is time you knew how I really feel. \n\nYour rooms are lovely at first glance, but there are problems when we look deeper. There was a broken towel bar in our master bath. We had to call maitenance to fix the ac (just like we did last year in the same room). My pillows were constantly stabbing my face with their errant feathers. And please don't get me going on the lack of internet. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and never have I experienced such spotty internet service. \n\nThe restaurants are a-ok, but you took away my favorite mexican, replaced with a dud BBQ and bow that has closed. This and the former Italian place both remain empty. \n\nThe shops are crappy. I won't hold it against you that you only have Pepsi and no Coke, but even the snacks suck, and there is no real shopping to speak of. It would be nice to get a couple cute things, or some good souveniers, but even this is impossible. \n\nI will say I like the pool. Chairs are nice, snackbar food is good and there are actually pools at different temps for your preferrence. \n\nService is good pretty much everywhere in the casino, but I think this is really a Vegas thing that continues everywhere. But special props to Patricia who cleaned our room almost everyday for many weeks and knew us all by name. She was really sweet. \n\nAll I can say Rio is that you are lucky that you host the WSOP.",352,1

Maybe there is an iron thief in the building? \nNoise from the room above... \nElectrical outlets did not work (3x)\n\n\n\nConclusion.... \nWe will not stay at the Vdara  again...  it's touted as a upscale hotel but it's smoke and mirrors... it's a 3 star place.\n \nIf you are looking to stay at in a nice suite... smoke free and casino free...  spend the same money and go to the MGM Signature.  Much nicer suites, great staff... just a nicer place to stay.",343,1
"There is basically three cool blue people, with little emotions.  Basically a night with hard percussion and flashy light show.  Mixed with slapstick skits that makes it fun.  You enjoy it if the interaction of your emotions to connect with the fun of the night, percussion, and soft humor.   \n\nGood show at the Venetian.  The theater is huge and top rate.   For the blue man group, is best at a smaller venue and off broadway.  Good vibe and One nice performance.  Its loses some of its tightness both in space and show with the larger venue.   But still keeping to its core and very entertaining.  \n\nNot a musical, not a broadway show, not a play, but best described as an off broadway performance art with a vegas size theater.",168,3
"Wow!! I saw this show a year ago and I'm still thinking about it.\n\nAs soon as I entered the theatre, I was greeted by staff already in costumes and acting their part. Even before the show started and while everyone is getting seated, we see tribal/barbaric people swinging around the theatre and running around on the floor  yelling and screaming in an unknown language. I didn't know what to think, but I loved it!\n\nThere is a very Asian theme to the show. The costumes were Asian influenced. There was martial arts in the acrobatics. It reminded me of a Peking Opera.\n\nThe huge rotating and moving multi-purpose platform was crazy! It's just so interesting how it is used in almost all the scenes. \n\nThe music is great, memorable, and really enhances the story. \n\nUnlike the other Cirque shows, there is a simple and easy to follow story that just pulls the whole show together.\n\nI can definitely recommend this show. It may not have the most original or best plot, but it just works together as a whole and there was quite a few acrobatics that left me gasping!",249,4
"Decent bar food when sober, absolutely revelatory when not.\n\nAppetizers tend to be good and filling. Chicken wings are sizable and the seasonings are unique. Everything really benefits from treatment in the live fire. Nachos are excessively cheesy but benefit from wood firing, as does the quesadilla. The optional chicken chili on both of these dishes is hearty and smoky.\n\nMain courses are a bit of a mixed bag. All the pizzas are delicious, as the oven imparts a nice char and crispness to the crust. Sandwiches are disappointing, as the bread they serve everything on is far too doughy and chewy without much crust to speak of. Burgers suffer from a lack of seasoning and inspired toppings. Fries are overhyped, both Uncle Sam's and Joe Mama's on the same street offer far superior versions. The sweet potato fries are decent, but again overhyped. Steer clear of the big plates, every time I've ordered one I wished I got a pizza instead.\n\nDesserts are wonderful, but let's be honest, when aren't they?\n\nDon't miss the great beer selection. House brown and pale ale are always on tap and fairly good, other than these they keep 8 others rotating draughts. The bottle list is gargantuan, there's bound to be something for everyone.\n\nAtmosphere is LOUD and service isn't always on par. But hey it's a college spot, what do you expect?\n\nIn short don't miss the apps, wood fired pizzas, and great beer list. Avoid the bland sandwich offerings and big plates.",340,3
"I'm not sure if I came here with higher expectations because I had heard that this place was awsome but I thought it was just ok and barely that. When we walked there was no AC and it was around 110 that day so you can imagine how hot it was in a place where they are grilling up food. It was super uncomfortable to sit there and eat when your hot and sweaty. They had dusty old fans blowing that look like they hadn't been cleaned in years. The place has a very old dingy look and feel to it even from the outside. As for the food also just ok, nothing impressive. \n\nI have to say I did not try the burgers, I had a chicken sandwich and fries.",154,2
"Came here after a night out with the boys.\n\nI don't recall much but I did order a reuben sandwich.  Let's just say she would be disappointed if she saw it!  Yep the sandwich itself was massive and for sure I wasn't able to finish it....or was it!?  Needless to say, I ended up downing the whole thing while chatting away about the night.  The toast was crunchy from the outside and soft towards the middle, giving it a nice crunch while you sink your teeth into the warm cornbeef.  Add a little zing and sting from the sauce and we're all good.  \n\nThe place itself was packing quick from the late-nighters.  Loud as it should be while some of the unlucky one continue to work their magic for one last hurrah at a one-nighter! - Enjoy!",184,3
"3.5 stars. My go-to pizza spot if i want something quick in Vegas at this moment. The pizza is always delicious for some reason. \n\nIt's a little booth at the dining area in Paris. We passed by this several times on our way to our Bally's room and it's great for a quick snack/meal. I ate this while playing slots and it was divine. $4.50 for a slice of combo, its bigger and taste way better than Costco pizza. It's super oily and greasy, thin crusted, but I think that's what makes it so delicious.  I ate here twice for dinner during our Vegas trip and I must say, it saved us from starving. We had no time to walk to McDonalds nor eat at a sit in restaurant, so this saved us time and energy, as well as money.\n\nLA PIZZA! While passing by it my friends and I always say it in a French accent, then Italian, then Spanish. Good times.",215,2

"I went to the Local tonight with the husband to celebrate my birthday (just the two of us). I must say, it was pretty awesome. The decor looks similar to when it was Scratch, but they moved the bar and got new furniture. It looks nice. The service was great, attentive and informative. We ordered a bunch of things to share including the pig ear pad thai, the gnocchi, and the brisket. The gnocchi was good, but nothing crazy amazing. It is one large gnocchi.... it had the consistency of a souffle almost and tasted good, but I don't think it's worth the 10$ price tag. The pad thai, on the other hand, was amazing! It had so much flavor, it was tangy, spicy, savory, but mostly it tasted extremely fresh. I loved every bite....yum. The brisket was also good, but a little on the fatty side (I know that's kind of the nature of brisket, but the way it was cut left a lot of fat on). The sauce was delicious and complemented the meat well. It was herby, a little citrusy, and tasted great. It came with brussels sprouts (which were nicely cooked and tasty), potatoes (which were cheesy , but nothing too special), and amazing onions... these onions were fabulous, not oniony....very sweet. They were unbelievable. Lastly, we had the chocolate tart.... this was a tasty dessert, but they should probably call it a peanut butter dessert...the peanut butter taste was far stronger than the chocolate, which you could barely taste at all. Despite this, it was a tasty dessert. I definitely would like to come back here to try their brunch and the other items on their menu.\n\nUpdate: I have been back to the Local a couple times and it definitely has some highs and lows. The pig ear pad thai is consistently good. I have had drinks here a couple times and they are also good. I had a drink on their new happy hour when I went recently that was very tasty (I can't remember what it was called, but it was fruity with a touch of mint and was topped with a huge piece of citrus skin) and it was a decent deal at 6$ on special. We also had the brisket sliders (on our slider tour of phoenix) and I must say that they were ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't order them again. Further, the last time I went here, the service was terrible (incredibly slow, inattentice) and the DJ was playing music so loud, I couldn't even hear a conversation. I hope they can work out the kinks because it would be a nice place to catch happy hour.",560,3

We want the very best for our kids and this includes our furry child also. Eli is the best dog any family could own. When we adopted him at 6 months old he had been originally taken here by his previous owner so we decided to follow up with this office. SO GLAD WE DID!

Will continue to make the trip because of the great care my Eli has received.,109,4

"I was so excited to try this place.  I think maybe sometimes anticipation makes for a huge let down.  \nI'm from LA.  I am Korean.  I live in Ktown.  I grew up on the best home cooked Korean food around (shout out to my Ma!)\nI also have access to the BEST Mexican food around.  LA has it going on.\n\nSo maybe...just maybe...these things worked against me in this instance.\n\nI wasn't impressed with the Korean or the Mexican aspect of this place.  Neither really stood out.  I was thinking like Street taco style tacos with Korean spice.  \nMy mom pointed out that she and I could probably do better putting kimchee on street tacos in LA.  \n\nI tried the chicken, pork and bulgogi tacos, the kimchee fried rice with spam and Spam musubi with fried egg.  \n-The tacos were just okay.  The meat in all three really could have been kicked up a notch.  They weren't memorable at all.  Not even the slaw on top had any flavor.  I had to drench with hot sauce (sauces are really good.  they come in a holder with 3 sauces) and tons of lime juice.  I do really like that you can get them with tortillas or in lettuce cups.  add a star for that. \n-The kimchee fried rice was just too...mushy.  And the spam was chopped so fine and tiny that I couldn't taste it.  Either add more or don't cut them so tiny.  I want to taste the spam.  Why else would I order it?\n-spam musubi with egg.  can't mess that up really.  \n\nService was kind of slow.  We had to ask our server for stuff or just get up and get it ourselves.  A few times she just ignored us completely.  Whatever.\n\nI don't want to knock this place. I give them mad props for the creative aspect.  Another star for that.  They have a good following here.  I'm just saying...if you're used to really good Korean food and really authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place for you.",487,1
"We have been going to this Red Brick Pizza at Gilbert Rd and Loop 202 for years,  and through all of the owner changes, and love this place, especially with the latest owners. They are the nicest people.  We had dinner there tonight, and I was happy to see, it was quite busy!  Very happy to see that, as most decent places here in South Chandler, close their doors within their first year, so we actually dont have many good choices down here.  My favorite pizza is the Pizza Bianca, with sausage, its delish.. My husband loves the Red Brick Gourmet and the chopped Italian salad is to die for!  I read the other reviews of this place, and cant believe that they had bad pizza or that its worse than Domino's. I am very careful as to what I eat, and am sensitive to excessive salt, so if it were overly salty, I wouldnt be writing this.  Great food, nice family eatery, and great service.  No, its not a 'romantic' dinner type place, but if youre going out for that, you wouldnt be going for pizza anyway.  Enjoy!",236,4

"While the food was really great, the service was deplorable! After being seated for at least 10 minutes we finally flagged someone down to take our drink order.  It wasnt for lack of wait staff because the two tables next to ours seemed to get plenty of attention. In fact, one of those tables was seated after us and they received their food before we even got our drinks!\nThis poor service continued throughout, no one checking for drink refills or to see if we needed anything else.  Meanwhile that table that got served before us (same number of people at the table) finished and was out the door about 15 minutes before us.  The only negative on the food was that I got a scramble with a side of roasted potatoes not knowing that the scramble included hashbrowns. The roasted potatoes were outstanding whereas the hashbrowns were old, fried, and very greasy. What a shame! Ask to sub roasted potatoes for hashbrowns. You wont be disappointed.",200,1
"I needed to go to urgent care for a bad sore throat and some back pain. I decided to go to this location due to previous reviews and Im very happy I did. I started out by checking in through Wahoo so i could wait at home and not there. I received an appointment time 5 min later of 3:15 which at the time was a half hour away...not bad for an urgent care. I walked in at 3:15 and was greeted by the receptionist which was really friendly.  I waited for 5 min while they updated my paperwork info. I was then taken back, the doctor listened to everything i had to say and then diagnosed. He gave me a few prescriptions including antibiotics for my throat and pain meds for my back pain. The doctor was very friendly and attentive. I walked out VERY happy. I was treated so well and probably if need would go back.  I thought that was the last time I would hear from them in awhile. After 2 days my doctor called to see how i was doing and i told him okay. The next morning i woke up with lets say a scorching sore throat that turned into strepp throat. Called urgent care and another provider talked to me over the phone and called in some last minute prescriptions because i couldn't swallow. I cant even begin to tell you how great this place is.  I had strepp throat and an infection and was so happy they could help. I wouldn't go anywhere else. I dont think my regular doctor has ever called me back after an appointment to check on me, let alone even have an available appointment. Thanks Nextcare Urgent Care, ill be coming back!",343,4
"One of our worst hotel experiences ever.  It is quite old and outdated.  The elevator (there's only one) is terribly slow.  The wireless Internet, while free, is slower than dial-up and is unusable.  We switched over to 3G connection to avoid it.  The barn door bathroom doors wouldn't even close all the way.  There was only one attendant at the front desk the entire 3+ day trip.  Breakfast, while free, was again very slow...a common theme for this establishment.  I ate the powered hotel eggs instead of ordered fried eggs after the first day because I didn't want to waste 30 minutes on breakfast.  The gym is open 24 hours but it is under provisioned with broken down aerobic equipment.  On the bright side, they did have dumbbells in the gym and large rooms with a nice shower.  Also, the location is excellent for access to ASU.  All in all, I'm surprised Sheraton allows its name on this one.  I won't be back.",223,0
"Horrible. Awful. Worst US airport ever!\n\nLadies bring your dollars. No your not going to the strip club, but you might feel like it. Especially if you have to go to the bathroom in Charlotte Douglas Airport where they have bathroom attendants. Personally I want to wash my hands in peace and not listen to someone call me \""honey\"" or \""sweety\"" or ask me for money. Further more I don't want to have to scurry out hoping to go unnoticed and feel guilty, like I'm doing something wrong. No I don't want to pay you money for doing your job. \n\nOn top of the awkwardness of the bathroom, you better hope to god that you don't have to get any food here. The people at any and all of the food stations must hate this place as much as I do, smiles are few and far between. \n\nMy final piece of advice, wear comfortable shoes and stay alert. You will be walking long distances during layovers and during that time are in danger of getting run over by the many carts that are zooming by. I guess most people have a hard time making their connector here, no wonder!",249,1
"The worst part of Le Peep is they aren't open for dinner, which only gives those of us who work during the week two days to enjoy all the delicious fare served up by Le Peep!\n\nOtherwise, I can't complain. Have always had a good experience and their food is delicious!",64,3
"I liked the french toast. And the tuna melt. It wasn't too greasy or mayo-y. Could've benefited from some veggies tho. The potatoes were good too. Great service. I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but if I was in the neighborhood, I'd stop in again.",68,2
"Other than emerging out of this restaurant smelling like curry, there are no drawbacks to the deliciousness that is Bombay. You have to get the naan here, it is a non-negotiable. I usually go for the chicken-stuffed variety, but I know that all the other kinds are equally delicious. The curry is perfection, as are the lamb kebabs. Delicious food and quaint seating.",81,3
Excellent falafel! The hummus is homemade and tasty. Best place to get a good falafel pita sandwich.  Love the outdoor seating as well.,31,3
A nice find tonight.  A strange location in a residential area albeit mainly university students.  Food was great pub food and the Hops IPA was refreshing.  A definite return visit is in order soon!  The place was buzzing for a Tuesday night and from what I hear is a tough seat to get most nights due to its popularity.,70,4
"Manager is the worst I have ever seen for customer service. He DOES NOT CARE what you think or need. Do Not buy at this location, and be very wary at any Sears Outlet store as I found out after talking to Sears Corp customer complaint office that Outlets operate under \""Different\"" rules and polices than the rest of the Sears stores.  Translation - Outlet managers should be looked at like used car salesmen, they will tell you anything until the sale is final then you play hell getting anything from them.!",103,0

"Burger King in the C-Concourse food court of McCarran Airport in Vegas.\n\nStraight away I'd suggest you avoid this place.  There are other options in the area, including a Wendy's back towards security a bit.\n\nThe service was rude and thoughtless.  The food took 5 full minutes to come out and was COLD.  You'd think that a wait like that means they are making hot, fresh food.\n\nThe area around BK was not kept clean and the condiments were low.  The soda machine was out of a couple flavors.\n\nOverall, this place is a disaster and if you're fortunate enough to check Yelp before eating here, I have one piece of advice:  RUN AWAY!",159,0
THE WORST CLUB EVER IN VEGAS!!! the crowd was filled with middle aged people and the music they played i couldn't dance to or get into smh. The drinks and watching the crowd that couldn't dance made the experience more enjoyable.,50,1
I had the linguine with clams and red sauce.  I have had this dish at over a hundred restaurants on this place delivers.  The clams were fresh and the sauce was very good.  The noodles could have been a bit better in my opinion to get the rare 5th star.  Want to go back and try some of the shellfish!,73,3

"I was looking for the best Mexican in Vegas and this is what I got???\nAs every restaurant might say on the strip - we are the best! But lets classify the burrito as one of the worst I have ever had. I will have to say that the chips and guacamole was half decent, the rest of my meal failed to impress!\nThe burrito had more of a Texas / onion / ranch taste to it.  I was looking for more authentic, but I guess you get what you get in Vegas - imitation!\nThe service was OK, the bartender was more concerned about what she was doing later on in the night and her tip.\nThe ambiance was pretty good though - great lighting,good energy and slot machines on my table! \nNext time it's off the strip to find some \""real\"" Mexican fare!",172,1
"Here's the thing, I've been here quite a few times and absolutely Love their Pad Thai, the best in Tempe after Tipps closed down.  However, the past two times I have been here I've gotten really bad service.  Last night I ordered the usual shrimp and chicken pad thai with the vegetable egg rolls and sweet n sour sauce as an appetizer.  We waited, and waited, for the eggrolls to come and about 15 minutes in we finally saw our waitress again..bringing out the eggrolls with our main meals...which was disappointing because we were starving and would have really enjoyed an appetizer.   First I noticed there was no sauce with the eggrolls and then, I realized that my Pad Thai came without shrimp, I waited for over five minutes for my waitress to come back but she was nowhere in sight so I told the hostess and she said she'd fix it, another five minutes passed and when she returned there were only two shrimp with it, i mean, seriously? You forget to give me shrimp and then 'remedy' the situation by only giving me two? Not enough.  Our actual waitress did not come by AT ALL for the remainder of our meal, not even to refill our waters once.  Also, the previous time I ate at Thai Rama the service was similarly bad.  While the food is indeed awesome, I don't think I'll stop by again due to the service",295,1
"I have found that most of the gelato shoppes opening up around the valley aren't really gelato. This is the real thing! The only place I have had better gelato was in Amalfi, Italy! Great service, they are happy to let you try before you buy, really good portion sizes, and great selection. Beautiful displays. I also like that they have charts showing how much less calories/fat that gelato has then regular ice cream.",91,4
"Had lunch today after kids' dental appointment across the street. The service was great - server was friendly, the hostess was kind to ask us if we needed more refills for the drinks. One of the managers was super kind and gave my kids some wet pipes that they use for sushi bar (pour some warm water over the paper hand wipes).\nMy kids enjoyed their kids lunch menu - mac & cheese and flat bread, they were tasty and I had yummy sushi & roll lunch. Overall, we had a great lunch experience there. Will go back there again!",113,4
I am a little hesitate about writing a review about this place because the stylist there are nice to me. I went there several times to get my eyebrows waxed and hair cut and flat ironed. There were times were they did good and times were they messed up pretty bad. I went in to get my eyebrows waxed and the lady made one of my eyebrow long and one short. The other time I went in she waxed so many times that I had skin peeling.One stylist has messed up on my highlights and made it to blonde in different sections and had to get it fixed. I got my hair burned because they used a strong flat iron I asked the stylist what is that smell while she was flat ironing my hair she said she didn't know and the other stylist were sitting there and didn't say anything to my response. I don't understand how you can stand there and not smell that my hair was burning? I trusted them and thought nothing of it till I came home. and then the manger had to use a condition treatment on my hair and when I went a second time the owner was there and she used a stronger conditioning treatment even when I told her that's not what the manger used and when I called the manger she went on by saying that maybe it was to much protein in my hair because after two treatment I was to see better results on my burned hair and did not. I don't understand what kind of owner they have there that wouldn't even listen to me when I said that's not what the manger used. I called to manager on what to do next she said that she would call the owner and get back to me and never did. They didn't seem to want to listen to the customers needs and they seem like they were helping me by doing the conditioning treatment but they should have gave me my money back.  I will not go back there. I don't trust this place,392,1
"Too inconsistent for me.  Crust tends to be overcooked so if like that, this is the place.  Ingredients are fine, especially the sausage.  NYC atmosphere is interesting and seating area small but adequate.",44,0
"Ambience: There were six of us for dinner including two grandchildren ages 4 & 7. Showing up with 6 people for dinner at other restaurants has presented a major problem, not so at this Red Robin. Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded with people waiting, after just 5 minutes they seated us at a round table that was an appropriate size for 6 people. We were far enough away from other tables that we didn't feel like we were bothering people at the next table with our children and the other tables were far enough away from us that their kids didn't bother us. The restaurant provided balloons and crayons and paper to draw on for the little ones. This is a major asset.\nFood: you don't come to Red Robin for gourmet food. You come for good food at fair prices. The children's menu is fairly extensive. And it is reasonably priced. We had one mac and cheese and 1 grilled cheese sandwich. I sampled each and both were really good. It came with sides that included a choice of a couple of fruits or vegetables or the omnipresent french fries. I had the Southwest grilled chicken salad. The salad was fresh, the chicken was tasty, and they had fried jalapeno that were surprisingly delicious. The portions were large so no one left hungry.\nService: our waiter came to our table fairly rapidly after we sat down. He took our drink orders immediately. He came back for a food order in a timely fashion. He got everything right. Service with a smile. I especially liked that the restaurant manager was present throughout the meal and stopped by our table at least 2 times to make sure that everything was going well.\nOverall, an excellent place to come with kids where both the kids and the adults can enjoy the meal.",366,3
"Merrrr so apparently Tryst was the place to be on a Thursday night for my visit to Vegas so we decided to check it out. I wasn't impressed..\n\nWe were on the guest list but it still took sooooo long to get inside. The guest list line was just as long as the general admission line. I finally pulled one of the workers over, which took A LOT of effort btw, and asked what was going on and why we weren't going in even though we were on guest list. He immediately asked for the name of our promoter and walked us in. NEVER HURTS TO ASK!\n\nMaybe because it was the place to be which is why it was PACKEDDDD. I could barely walked anywhere. I felt bad for my girl friends, who trekked everywhere in their 4-5 inch heels. Poor souls.. Getting onto the dancefloor was virtually impossible and security was pushing us around to stay away from the tables... uhhhh can't help it.. seriously. \n\nOk, yes the club is beautiful inside and the waterfall is ginormous and amazing to look at, but my group couldn't really handle the overwhelming crowd in such a small space. It got to the point where my friend couldn't handle the crowd and cramped area so we had to leave early and just hang out at the casino. I honestly would want to give this place another shot. Until next time!",296,2
This is one of my favorite places in the Pittsburgh area I've been here numerous times.  The draft beer is always good but don't except a ton of choices to be on tap all at once.  Don't listen to the negative reviews by the annoying foodies and hipsters.  I mean seriously are they ever happy?  They build a place in Pittsburgh that does not revolve around sports and TV's yet they still complain.  The menu has all sorts of things on it and I love the German potato salad and the red apple kraut.   The place can get really busy and loud though so if you're the type of person that is turned off by that I recommend trying to go when it is more low key.  In the warmer months there is outdoor seating that is used but in the colder months everyone is inside.,175,4
"Truly, I've experienced better.\n\nAs other Yelpers have noted, I am sure this place has improved quite a bit since it first opened. What I found most off-putting from my first couple of visits, though, was the service! I sincerely value good service, and good service wasn't what my friends and I received at Republic Ramen.\n\nTo play devil's advocate, I usually do go to Republic Ramen with rather large groups of friends. I can see how this can get to be overwhelming, with 15+ hungry adults placing orders and demanding food right away. I just felt like some of the staff could have been nicer/less rude/more attentive?\n\nThe food was also...okay. I didn't think they were particularly memorable dishes in any way. Same goes for the boba tea shop next door (which is part of the same restaurant, I believe).\n\nI might give Republic Ramen another shot--this is one of the closer ramen shops in my area, so I definitely want to give it anther go. I do hope the experience is more enjoyable this time around.",236,1

"I went here with a small group after dinner on a summer Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded - I'm assuming everyone was busy trying to get into Light.\n\nCrowd - Upscale Hipster\n\nDrinks - 10/10\nMenu creativity and execution made our visit a very great experience. Also, they present the menu on an iPad - ohhhhhh schmancyyyyy! We didn't get a chance to order any food but the drinks were pretty darn expensive. Of course it was expected, it's Vegas. I will say this - I rather pay $15 for these delicious little concoctions rather than $15 for a RedBull/Vodka at the club. The bar area has a snazzy mirror above the island which allows customers to spectate the bartender as drinks are made. A lot of TLC is put into each drink and each one has it's own unique signature.\n\nAtmosphere - 9/10\nDim lit, intimate, mellow. Very clean! +\n\nService - 9/10\nVery polite and attentive. I asked a busy waitress to point me toward the bathroom - she stopped what she was doing and escorted me all the way there. Although unnecessary, very much appreciated.\n\nI enjoyed my time here and would like to eventually try their entire menu.\n\n*September 2013",295,3
"Food 9/10 Best waffle's I've had in Vegas ever. Highly recommend the flax waffle. \n\nDrinks 7/10 Standard soft drinks, breakfast combo comes with unlimited coffee, Thai Tea had too much thai tea and not enough condensed milk (aka way too orange)\n\nEnvironment 8/10 Good breakfast sunshine from the windows in the morning, and nice and cool during the hot summer days. Not a fan of Styrofoam plates and cups when eating in, but its understandable. \n\nEnjoyment 9/10 I have gone to this place at least two dozen times. Great food, great family, and very accommodating if anything went wrong. \n\nOverall 33/40 = 82.5% = 4 stars. \n\nI grew up in the east coast, DC area to be exact. When most people think of a Waffle house, one can't help but think of Fried Chicken and Belgian waffles and a slightly dirty Denny's style diner. Sadly that's what I thought of when I first approached \""WaffleS\"". This was not the case\n\nFirst impression is its super clean environment and bright lights. It's definitely not an ethnic style waffle house. This is done asian style, hence the 'Cafe in WaffleS Cafe. And I can tell you I'm definitely a fan of this place. The first time going there you'll get a small culture shock as all your stereotypes get blown out of the water, THEN you'll get a little shock at the different varieties and styles of waffles you can choose from, literally a plethora of combinations. \n\nWhen you decide from choosing between a standard, pizza, or sandwich waffle, you have 5 types of batter. From there, there's a a few dozen toppings from anchovies to strawberries, lets not forget all the syrups and such. \n\nIf you want a waffle your way you will get it your way. My personal favorite is the standard flaxseed waffle with maple syrup. But if i feel a little indulgent, you can't help but try Yooni's Favorite: Plain Waffle, with bananas, strawberries, whipped cream, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, topped with chocolate syrup.",479,3
"I really wanted to like the Grand Concourse - so I made a reservation to take my wife there for our wedding anniversary. This was our first time here. I've seen the pictures and was looking forward to seeing the opulent dining area. Our visit, however, didn't meet our expectations. \n\nService: \n - The guys who walked in behind us were greeted before us, despite us standing right next to the front desk. \n - Our server mixed up our drinks and our meals between the two of us. There was also no attempt to make our visit feel special aside from a pre-printed menu that said \""happy anniversary.\"" Reading other reviews, I'm sad that we didn't get the same attention and service that others here have. \n\nAtmosphere: \n - I'm sure the place is lovely inside, but we never got to see it. The entire concourse was closed off for a wedding reception. This is great for the wedding party, but it would have been nice to have been informed of this before we walked in the door for our reservation. \n - It was very loud and difficult to hold a conversation, not lending itself to a romantic night out. \n + The back room has a nice view of the city and we were able to sit near the windows. \n\nFood: \n + The rolls were excellent and were served with butter and salmon pate. \n - Bruschetta Montrachet: Good flavors but unfortunately the \""crisp flatbread\"" was soggy by the time it made it to our table. \n + Caribbean Combo: Crabcake and potatoes were both good. The coconut shrimp with mango salsa were excellent. \n + Filet Mignon: A decent cut of steak, but not as good as others we've had. Only 2 pieces of asparagus were on the plate. You'd think $27 would buy a few more pieces.  \n - Drinks: Overpriced and underwhelming at $9 a piece. \n\nFor what ended up as $50+ per person, I would have liked this to be a much better experience than it was. I'm happy to pay that much for a meal if the service is up to par, but it was not. As my wife and I were describing the service experience on the way home we simultaneously said, \""Applebees\"" - certainly not \""Grand.\"" In the end, it doesn't look like we will be back. We have been to plenty of other restaurant options with solid service and excellent food for less.",533,1
"Went here on the first night of a week-long sales conference with part of my new extended team.  Someone in the original group couldn't go so they asked me and I jumped at the chance.  I've only seen a handful of shows in Vegas so I was excited to see this one.  It shows at TI (Treasure Island) which gives you a sense of its place in the hierarchy of Cirque shows.  It's better than the traveling Kooza in most ways, but not as good as O.\n\nThe show is pretty funny.  Yes there are definitely parts where it is breathtaking and spectacular, but what strikes me the most are the funny parts.  It's not even just a 30-second way to transition between scenes.  There are full-on 5-7 minute skits where it's that big baby or the crazy emcee.  Funny yes, but they completely break up the flow of a show without a lot of flow to begin with.  Where Le Reve was simply visually stunning at times, Mystere has some really trippy parts where I just have to sit back and shake my head a few times.  Nothing lewd or incendiary, but it's somewhat surreal to be watching.\n\nAs for the acts, some where astonishing, but I actually feel like Kooza (even in the smaller stage and area in the AT&T Park parking lot in SF had more astounding physical acts.  We sat slightly off center stage and about 6 rows back, so we had a very good view of the stage and everything around us.  There is more crowd interaction than a lot of shows, particularly Le Reve and Kooza.  They brought at least 2 people on stage and interacted directly with about 8 people in the audience.\n\nVery good show.  Unless you're a hardcore O fan, you will definitely enjoy this.",397,3

"This apartment is TERRIBLE!!!! I have had nothing but issues since I moved in 2 weeks ago. Not only did the staff misinform us on information about the apartment prior to moving in, but they called me 3 days before moving in to tell me that I have to wait another day to move in because the office is closed. We had this move in date set for 3 months. Now this may not be an issue to many people, but it was a problem for me because I moved from Chicago. I needed to move in the day I was planning on because I had no where else to stay. That was just the beginning though... \n\n1.) We realized a few days after moving in that we were charged over $500 more on our rent than we were supposed to pay. They did inform us that we paid $420 over. However, after reviewing the statement the office gave us, which included everything we were charged and have paid, it made no sense. Basically, we saw that they charged us two times on things that should have only been charged one time and all of the math was wrong. The amount they owe us just kept adding up. \n\n\n2.) We have ZERO cell service in our apartment. It is a complete dead zone. My roommate and I are also not the only ones with this issue. We have talked to other residents who have complained about having no cell service. This may not be the staff's problem, which we understand, but it sucks that I have to lay against my bedroom window just to talk to my mother because that is literally the only place I can get MAYBE 2 bars on my phone.\n\n\n3.) The next issue, which we have ben dealing with for about a week now, is our cable. The day we moved in the staff in the office told us that we can get Cox or DirecTV. We decided on DirecTV. The morning the man came to install it, he told us that these things he needed to access on the roof were completely closed off and he could not access them until the maintenance people opened them. My roommate and I went straight to the office to ask if they could open the things on the roof. They told us it would be a half hour, so we had to send the DirecTV man away so we could make his other appointment. FOUR HOURS LATER, the maintenance people still had not fixed anything. I went and asked the office if it was finished yet and the lady helping me didn't even think to call the maintenance people to ask, she only thought to e-mail them. Pretty dumb considering a phone call would take much less time and she would get a response quicker through a phone. I went in the office again the next day to see if they finally finished the task, and they told me it was all worked out. \n\nSo the DirecTV man came back today. He told us that the maintenance people only opened one of the things on the roof and not all of them. When we went to ask the maintenance people to finish their original task, they were extremely rude to us. They also proceeded to tell us that WE need to go to all of the apartments above us and ask if we can get access to their utility closet on their balconies in order to drag a cord down to our apartment just so we can get cable. I find this completely ridiculous!! We shouldn't have this many issues just to get cable in our apartment. Also, the maintenance people should have done everything that needed to be done 5 days ago when we originally asked them to. They just did a half ass job and complained that they have \""too much to do.\"" BULL SHIT!\n\n\nI have only lived here for 2 weeks and I already hate it. I have never had more issues than I have had here in any other apartment I have lived in. The staff in the office have no idea how to help us with anything, and the manager is extremely rude. Not only was she a total bitch to my roommate, but she was even more awful to my roommate's mother. Completely disrespectful and not helpful one bit. The only good thing about this place are the amenities. The pool is pretty and they have a good gym. Besides that, I would NOT suggest living here.",889,0
"Hey look at me, Im a big fancy resturant in a big fancy hotel and casino and I really don't give a shit about how my customers are handled or, apparently, the quality of food I seve.\n\nIve eaten here ONCE. The aforementioned points were the negatives. The decor was nice and I really wanted to like the place but it simply was a very unpleasant experience.\n\nLas Vegas is an interesting town; You never really know at any given time how much money someone might be willing to spend. Most of the city has figured it out, you treat everyone like a king and you don't judge a book by it's cover. Apparently Gaylord didn't get the memo.\n\nIf you're stuck up and like a stuck up environment with pretencious food, enjoy!",171,1
"Overhyped!!! Overpriced!!!  Food was kinda cold and the BBQ chicken was pink inside. \""Raw\"". The worst part is that the servings are too small. For being the best Thai food in Vegas, it's pretty weak. The service is not that bad though.",59,1
"Sad visit for a Celiac. I ordered the 2 eggs. Which comes with bacon, potatoes and toast. Obv I went w/o the toast but then I also couldn't get the potatoes bc they are made in the same place as the chicken fingers. So I asked for extra bacon and they gave me 1 extra slice... I payed for an entire meal and got maybe half. Also the lowest they go on eggs is over medium. Just not really impressed after being a long time fan and a frustrated new celiac. Time to step up the GF game, Rachel.",120,0
"My family and I decided to take a walk down the strip, leaving beautiful Paris for the lousy mall attached to MGM Grand. We were delighted to read such positive yelp reviews of Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. What a mistake! These clowns are rude and crude. If you don't plan on ordering overpriced wine prepare to be treated bad. The food was meh.",79,0
"Super tiny and perennially busy, so I expected the best when we finally got our table (after hearing lots of rave reviews and trying, unsuccessfully, to dine here on more than one occasion.) Sadly, my basil and tofu something or other was tasty but not really outstanding; same for my companion's red curry. The wine list and beer options were solid, but overall I found it a little pricey for what we got. Honestly I fear I somehow ate here INCORRECTLY, given the positive everythings this place is always getting.",110,2
"Fast service, very nice girl, good food. My new place to go for a Mexican fix. I only get the chimichanga, so I can only vouch for that, but its great. Much better than Caminero's that's down the road (I ate there thrice and got diarrhea all three times, and that NEVER happens to me).",73,4
"I was craving for some chicken wings so after worked, we stopped by Harold's.  I am from Texas so after seeing that Harold's offer chicken gizzards, I immediately ordered the gizzards and wings combo.  My boyfriend got the chicken giblets combo.\n\nWe chose a table close to the chilly entrance, not because we enjoy the chilly breeze, but because there were no other tables available.  The restaurant has about 7 tables or so.  As we were waiting for the food, I grabbed some napkins to clean our table and chairs of the chicken batter crumbs that were left behind by the previous customers.\n\nThe coleslaw and utensils arrived first at our table.  I was so hungry so I down the coleslaw.  It came in a teeny tiny container.  Awhile later, food arrived and they were all piping hot.  Yes, 2 wings, a pile of gizzards, and lots of french fries for me, chicken giblets and more french fries for my bf.  Gosh I wish there were 1 more extra wing and less gizzards.  My teeth are not the strongest teeth so chewing on the hard gizzard was quite tiring.  \n\nMidway through the meal, I was all fried and gizzarded out and my bf had to get a diet coke to cut the richness of the giblets.  \n\nOverall, eating this in moderation is alright, but I would probably save all those calories for wingstop wings.\n\nBut customer service was great.  I do want to come back to try the regular fried chicken though.",345,2

"Oh Excalibur, oh sweeet sweet Excalibur. How I love you so.\n\nI am enamored by your hallways; they make me feel homey and warm. I love your lay-down pool areas. Your exterior...simply stunning especially at night. Forget the naysayers, I love my mini-Disney for adults. The room was comfortable. But please, my love, I wish you had better shows to choose from. As much as I liked the Australian BeeGees, I could not righteously see myself watching horses and revues. A comedy show? A play perhaps? I also hope that you will one day bring a nightclub that I can enjoy! I love your spaciousness and your great selection of slots. Not to mention, your craps with better odds. What draws me closer to you is your food court, and I admire your buffet. Mcds, cold stone, krisy kreme, under one roof? A most brilliant concept! Yes, I certainly do not mind your arcade as I go in there to a get a fix now and then. I appreciate your outdoor and indoor connections to other hotels. But you are the chief, you are my buddy.\n\nThis is my love letter...just for you.",260,4
"Todd English is alright. Sure, they have a lot of microbrews; however, I don't think I ever spent more on a microbrew before. It is best to come here for the twice daily happy hour to get 50% off beer on tap.\n\nThe food is also okay. I ordered some chicken sliders, which were just okay. My girlfriend and I also ordered some appetizer, but I can't remember now.",93,2
"I would definitely go here again if I was craving Asian food in Madison.\n\nThe beef and chasiu (pork) won ton noodle soup was delicious.  They do the meat really well. \n\nThe noodles on the other hand were just okay.  The egg noodles in the won ton soup tasted like they were from a package. The Curry Ho Fun noodles were a decent texture, but the curry sauce left something to be desired. \n\nAs a Chinese Restaurant in Madison: 4 stars\nIf this restaurant was in SF Bay Area: 3 stars",122,2
"This is a very trendy and comfortable coffee house. I spent hours their today and it was my first time in. The menu is nothing but the basics, lattes, espresso, mocha, and fresh brewed to order cups of coffee. It's unique because they brew each cup of coffee when you order it. It doesn't sit in a coffee still for hours waiting to be pored then consumed, so in other words the coffee never tasted \""burnt.\"" If you have some time to kill and need a creative place to sit then stop in.",112,3
"One of my favorite places to eat. The menu is very diverse and its overall decently good especially for the price. For breakfast i would suggest the original breakfast burrito. It comes with diced ham, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, eggs, and cheese. I always add gravy to it and its about $5.25 after tax, really good considering its an entire breakfast in a burrito. For lunch and dinner the burger special can't be beat. But all in all most everything here is good especially if you stick to the traditional american food.  I hope this review helps and enjoy cause i do that's why im the duke of this joint!!",135,3
"My wife and I love this place.  The food is always good and the service has been great.  We love how friendly and inviting the restaurant is.  Table side guac is a great addition to their menu.  The happy hour specials are great too.  We have had a lot of different items on their menu and our favorite is the fajitas.  They are fresh, well prepared, and the rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, and pico that comes with it are fantastic.  The sangria is amazing.  Keep up the good work!",116,3
"Sorry for 1 star rating but I should be completely satisfied with my Pediatrics and I will no longer continue our relationship with Healing Hearts. Heres our story:\nWhen we first visited everything seemed great but with time things have gone downhill. Personally I believe Dr. Romero and McKenna are very sincere, genuine and knowledgeable however we have a problem with how their business is run.\nWe have 3 girls ages 1 1/2, 2 1/2 and 9 years old. We have been with this doctor for 3 years.\nStrike 1:\nI called this office on a Thursday around noon to get a recording that they are closed for 2 Hours for lunch.  Now I understand that in some cases they do this to catch up on paperwork and things but a 2 hour lunch?? What businesses do you know \""these days\"" that take a 2 hour lunch and don't answer phone calls???\nWhen I called I left a message and requested a first available appointment.  Their recording says leave a message and we will call you right back. They reopen around 1 or 2 I think so I waited till 3 and then called back and to my surprise they had no record of me leaving a message, they never called me back so I figured that. I said well I was calling to schedule an appointment which she then said we are all booked today and tomorrow. I said did you make any appointments for tomorrow since being back and she said yes, people have called. I said well I should have been in front of them and she said theres nothing she can do for me. So I asked for Dr. Romero to call me about this issue. \nDr. Romero called me on my cell around 530PM, I told her the situation and she apologized didn't know why that happened, she said it was an isolated incident but still said that she wouldn't be able to fit me in at the Gilbert office, she offered the Chandler office but that's too far for us.\nStrike 2.\nMy wife went in with our 15 month old for her shots, her appt was scheduled for 9AM\nshe had made arrangements to go into work later that day so it was important to get in and out. She arrived for her appointment at 845AM and was taken into the room at 9AM, the staff asked her to take off my babys' clothes and wait for the doctor to come in.  They had her wait in that room for 45 minutes with a naked, skirmish and unhappy baby!!!!! She finally opened the door and said is she coming in soon and the doctor was at her computer and said yes, sorry running a little behind. \nWhy couldn't they have called us or notify us before having my wife in there for 45 minutes???\nStrike 3.\nLast night my youngest was coughing had a runny nose and miserable, couldnt sleep so my wife said schedule an appointment first thing.\nWell I called at 622AM left a clear message that I want to schedule an appointment for my daughter ASAP please call me back...\nGuess what? No one called me back.\n\nI think if you are a \""NEW Patient\"" They must mark that somewhere and treat you extra special, ie. keeping appointment prompt, pleasant staff, etc...After sometime you become unimportant to them OR They have too much they cant handle, either way I just need a doctor that can respect our time and can actually listen to messages and return calls.\n\nThank you for all your hard work McKenna & Romero but its just not the right place for us anymore.\nKent",761,0
"I don't know what it was....but it might have been an off day - Tao Beach came in way below my expectations.  I had more fun at BARE the day before and I think it was because of the crowd.  It felt like a damn fashion show and girls trying to one-up each other.  \n\nWe had a day bed so it gave us a \""home base\"" but even then, the crowd wasn't as friendly as I imagined.  It wasn't as what we expected so we paid our $435 bill and left after 2 hours.  The music was okay....nothing that made me want to get up and dance.  \n\nAs for the food and drinks - expensive of course.  But that's expected. I heard Moorea is better so I'm checking that out next!",181,2
"The drinks and the guacamole are really outstanding.  Really yummy.  \n\nThe actual meals really lacked taste when made vegan.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you have someone with food sensitivities or allergies in your party.  They really did try to be accommodating, but they struggled getting the order right.  When the order did come out, it lacked taste completely.  I'm sure their regular menu made the regular way is amazing because the guacamole was one of the most amazing things that I have ever eaten.  \n\nAlso, very pricey.  More expensive than I would have anticipated (even considering its location) and I did not feel like I got what I paid for overall.",148,2
First thing I noticed was how messy this place was. Looked as if it was a Disco by night and Restaurant by day!!!\nBeing a connaisseur of real Sechuan food I was a little excited that maybe possible we finally have a decent one in Montreal. WAS NOT TO BE!!!\nI guess I still have to take the 401 to get my realy spicey fix.\nLanb was the only thing that was half decent. The spicey chicken which I really went for was a total dissapointment. Not enough peppercorn and was notthing but greasy chicken!! In china its dry...\nThe noodles had a bit of a taste but no juice(Soup) like WTF!!!\nService was typical montreal china town...below par...\n\nIf you want the real stuff go to Toronto or china not worth the calories...,175,1
The food was average and the dinning room was really loud. Service started out good but ended terrible. It took 15 mins from the time they took our dinner plates to receiving the dessert menu.  It looks like they have 3 waiters and 4 servers/bus boys. The communication between both is where I think we fell through the crack.\n\nI used a groupon and they automatic add a tip. I would have left only 3% if I had a choice.\n\nTips = To Insure Proper Service,112,1

"Besides finding GLASS in our butter, the service was very slow and food was not worth the price. For their selections and quality of the food, the menu would be better suited at the $15-20 range and not high $20's-30's.\n\n In addition, our reservations were incorrectly made and the waiter was extremely skiddish and unknowledgable about the food.Furthermore, when we notified management of the glass in our food- the bar manager promised someone would call me the next day to 'right their wrong.' \n\nThree days later I called and after being hung up on, I finally spoke with John, he asked me what I wanted after I explained who I was. After I told him I was promised Bonterra would 'right this wrong,' he then tried to pass the glass of as ROCK SALT. I told him, 'uh, no. it was not rock salt, i can tell the difference. besides, rock salt would not cut my gum.' Finally, he offered a refund or gift certificates-- I accpeted the refund. John told me it would take 36 hours to process. A week later, still no refund was processed. I again had to contact Bonterra. John emailed me back: \""We do not have access to your full credit numbers and exp date. We were waiting to hear from you so we could process.\"" Bonterra has my cell phone number, my husband's cell phone number and both of our email addresses.\n\n I was quite surprised by the complete lack of urgency and pure laziness by the owner. I guess, if I were running a business and someone found glass in my food, I would act hastily to make sure my customer's image of my restaurant is not tainted.\n\nNow, not only is there a cut in my gum left from my experience at Bonterra, there is also a bitter taste in my mouth.",397,0
"Irene's was my favorite spot to drink whilst on vacation. \n\nWe ordered a pizza and I don't remember what my bf ordered, a burger, I think? Our pizza was really good. I think it had jalepenos and sausage. And maybe extra cheese? It was like $7. Had two drinks while we sat and enjoyed the company. The bartender was so sweet and friendly. They have a daily contest where you can win cash money if you come a few days a month and gamble there. It wouldn't work if you don't live there so I tuned out on the details. \n\nI don't know why we even bother with the strip. Get off the strip, people. See the real Vegas. \n\nLeftovers were yummy the next morning, cold or warmed. It's a dive but a good one.",183,4

"First time here and went in for a staight manicure ($15). The front desk and ambience are great. Tammy, who took care of me, was not friendly nor a good listener. She asked if I wanted square tip, I said round. She filed my first hand square.  I asked if she could please file them round, so she had to cut my nails even shorter. When it came to painting my nails, she left me under the ultraviolet light to do someone else's pedicure. A little unsure, I sat there too long until the gal next to me asked, \""how long did she tell you to sit here?\"" Her nail gal said I should be done.

"We came to Bar + Bistro to celebrate the departure of a coworker.  It was a nice bright Saturday afternoon and we wanted to check this place out!\n\nHere's what I like:  The outside space is pretty cool!  Lots of standing room and ample tables for food.  The parking lot is actually bigger than I thought.  \n\nHere's what I didn't really like:  I wanted to eat food, however, heard that his place got shut down a number of times for health regulations.  I did try some french fries from a friend, however it was really soggy.  Also, the bartender was a bit slow.  I ended up getting two mimosas at once so that I didn't have to wait again for a second round.  Not really a fan of that as my second mimosa got warm by the time I was ready for it.  \n\nIf you know me, you know that I'm a huge fan of Downtown/Arts District businesses.  I'm not hating on this place.  In fact, I wouldn't mind going back for the outside space.  Well, maybe not in the summer, but I appreciate the concept!  I think with the previous food reputation, it may take some time for this place to boom, however, I will definitely give this another try for an update!",288,2
"Elizabeth Square = FAIL.  We recently just moved out- thank God.  It was one of the worst apartment experiences ever.  The most recent issue that we had with Elizabeth Square is that they charged us $280 to replace the carpet.  When we called about this- they said that due to stains (which were already there when we moved in) we are charged with replacing the carpet.  Crazy how we would get charged for replacing carpet when we were probably the 5th tenant that lived on those gross carpets.  They just decided that we were the lucky ones that would pay for someone else to have new carpets.  I could go on and on about how terrible this place is.  If you are a college student then this is the right place for you- if you can afford it.  The fire alarm goes off in the middle of the night just about every month- no matter what day it is...I am assuming someone wanted to pull a prank and watch everyone else stumble out of their apartment at 2:00 in the morning and sit for an hour until the fire department comes and checks everything out.  You have to watch were you walk in all the hallways and stairways because you just might stumble on dog poop, throw up, left over pizza, and food.  Beware where you park because you just might get your car hit by some crazy drunk person that lives at Elizabeth Square.  This one was a doozie- 4 cars were nailed literally...like pieces of their cars going up the parking garage- causing tons of damage because someone was driving too fast through the parking garage.  You cannot even go to the pool because it is like a frat party, people are shot gunning cans of beer in the pool, booty humping, and people are there that do not even pay rent.  Security is consistently compromised because everyone leaves the outside doors open- so anyone off the street can walk into the apartment building.  Try to move in on a Saturday and everyone and their brother is also moving in...you can barely get into the parking garage.  It is a cluster mess.  The worst part about it is that it was so expensive to live there.  We paid over $1800 in rent for a 2 bedroom that was not functional at all.  The closet in the second bedroom was not accessible- because the door was in the way.  You had to shimmy yourself in between your clothes to close the door to get to your other hanging clothes.  The place is awful- whatever you do not live there.  Go next door to the Metro...Elizabeth Square is not worth it.",542,0
"Last week some friends and I decided we wanted to go someplace that had good pizza. This placed was rated the best on yelp and I usually can trust their rankings.  \n\nUnfortunatley, I was really disappointed.  The pizza was average/ below average.  I'd say one step above fast food delivery.  Our server, Yoshi, was courteous when he was around but we had to go find him inside the restaurant when all 5 of us had no more water and had run out of beer.  \n\nThey would have gotten 2 stars but the owner/manager was very nice and came out to talk to us a few times.  \n\nThere has GOT to be better pizza in this town!!

"2 quotes total, the other was a biz already rated on Yelp.  I was turned off by the other b/c 1) overquoted my sq footage by 150 ft (he did a haphazard very quick laser beam test) 2) suddenly lost eye contact w/ me in determining the price and 3) everytime he talked to me (he followed up w/ me almost daily.. I'll give him credit for that), it seemed like he'd drop the price another $150-200.  By the end, after I thanked him for his time and told him I'm going somewhere else... he called me up an hour later and offered to undercut this company by $100.  By now, we were at 50% of his original quote... SHADY.  It's ok to make a profit and have some play, but constantly driving down your own price in high pressure tactics to get into the door just made me feel ripped off.\n\nMy dad is an indy contractor himself, so even w/ the undercut, I thanked him again, reconfirmed I've committed to someone else and couldn't do that to the other company.  Why I went here...  Owner Shannon quoted over the phone, price by sq footage (not a size-you-up-estimate).  When she came to actually measure, all the pricing was std and straightfwd and her good ol' tape measure was 150 sq ft less than the other guy (I did not even tell her about my experience w/ the other guy until the job was done)... I was impressed from beginning to end.  She worked around the other 5-6 contractor schedules I was juggling, with her and family coming in an doing the work directly.  As far as I can tell (since the other guy literally grilled me when I told him I'm passing), she was providing the same exact service and product for cleaning and re-sealing the grout.\n\nWhat a difference when you choose to re-seal!  Years of grime has vanished under the protective coat (cleaning itself does not save the grout).  Shannon kindly left me some addtl silicone grout and leftover seal, as she knew I'll be needing touchups and addtl repair before all the contractors were done. \n\nGreat customer service!",492,3
This franchise has great food but I've noticed in some of the locations there's always workers that half ass the food just because maybe they're lazy.

"We came here on a very strong recommendation of a friend and loved it!  The chips came with two salsas and a bean dip, all were very good.

The rice and beans were no nonsense and very tasty too.  Friendly service and the prices were more than reasonable.  Will return for sure.",102,4

The wheat was probably the best, but nothing to come back for.\n\nWe got this great food sampler the server recommended for us.\nTwo pretzels, two mustards, tons fo sauerkraut, and maybe 5 or 6 different sausages.\nThe pretzels did not taste super fresh, but were quite good. \nThe sausages were amazing.\n\nAll in all, I don't feel a need to return, which is a shame, but it was a fun experience and I would recommend trying it if you haven't.",178,2

"Hostess was not friendly.  We were not greeted.  Once we were seated our server was slow and inattentive.  I asked for crispy bacon w/ my meal, the server said \""of course, no problem.\"" it came floppy.  We didn't see our server again until we were about ready to leave.  We mentioned it, she was going to charge us for an additional side of bacon, until she took it back to the kitchen and it came incinerated- like they threw it in the microwave for 5 minutes.\nThe tortilla on the breakfast burrito lacked moisture as well.  The one good thing is the blueberry pancakes.  That is the silver lining.",142,0

"I'm a frequent traveler to Phoenix and a Hertz Gold Member. This is by far the WORST car rental service I've experienced! My last four visits had one or two employees working the counter and a line that went well outside the door. Took over an hour each time to get a vehicle.  Turn-in is even worse! One employee trying to check-in 15 cars when people have flights to catch is a joke! I finally said \""F\"" it today, drove my car to the check-in, saw the same one dude trying to check-in all the cars with all the people waiting, so I left it and the keys in the car and walked away...had a flight to catch!

"These guys are really helpful, when I was in first year and was pretty bored me and my mate had done all the usual things people new to Edinburgh do so we wanted to try something different. We went up to a guy in the Tourist Information Centre and told him we were bored and had no money- and asked him what we should do. We were half expecting him to laugh at us, but he gave us a map and asked what we had done already. He ended up telling us that we should go on a scenic route on the Water of Leith, through Dean Village and eventually on to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, which has free entry. We ended up doing what he said and it was a good cultural day out that I probably wouldn't have experienced if it were not for this place.",164,3

It's Sunday night. We're at Red Rock Casino and have time to kill before watching The Croods at 9..My boyfriend is starving and I am on day 6 of a detox so can't eat with him but will settle for some tea with lemon. We were just going to get him some prime rib at the cafe but the line was long so we decided to venture out and give Hachi a go since they looked pretty empty. \n\nI really loved the ultra chic look of Hachi.. You definitely don't feel like you're at Red Rock Casino anymore. I would say the prices are pretty high for a local casino joint almost strip prices. My bf decided on a chicken teriyaki plate (chicken + steamed rice) which was $22!!!.. must be some bomb chicken teriyaki right??? Ehhh he said it wasn't bad but it's definitely not the best he's ever had. It was a grilled chicken breast with teriyaki glaze on it. As I watched him eat I was thinking hmm we should come back and actually eat a meal here since the atmosphere is so nice. \n\nSo the 2 stars is for the service. I know from working in the restaurant industry no one wants a couple where the guy just orders an entree and the girl just gets tea. But I am on a DETOX ...which I told our server from the get go and my man didn't want to be feasting without me. We just felt as though the server thought of us as a burden for being there & looked down on us. Had he done a better job and been more friendlier perhaps we would have left happier and would want to go back like we were originally planning on doing. pftttt. \n\nHOT TIP: check out their daily Happy Hour at the bar 5-7 and hopefully their bartender will not treat you like you're a burden.,398,1
"I love this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved to a smoke free environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly and very \""with it.\"" This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!",168,4
"Service was prompt and the food and good! Really enjoyed that they had a happy hour but was a little surprised when the happy hour portions were just a couple bites. The server didn't explain that and when I ordered mushrooms for the table, it ended up being a couple bites for one person. If we needed enough for the table, we might as well have ordered a full priced item. \n\nOther than that, this is a good little place to grab some fresh, semi-healthy foods. My kids love the hummus trio and my wife and I always seem to order the chipotle chicken lavash pizza!",127,3
"Fast and friendly service, reasonable prices and the french toast was big, fluffy and delicious. If you don't beat the morning rush expect to have to wait a while. On the plus side they do offer complimentary coffee while you wait.   How busy it gets is definitely a testament to the quality of the restaurant.",65,4
I can't believe their doughnuts are vegan! The Boston Cremes are amazing. They also have soy milk for the coffee.,27,4
We loved this place until tonight. The chef/owner screamed at me because I did not like the sauce on my pasta and ordered something else. He had the waiter charge me for both dishes and then came out of the kitchen to scream at me for about 5 minutes. \nWe are disappointed because we have recommended this place to dozens of people and went there about once a week for months. I cannot believe that this happened and I will be sure to tell anyone who will listen to take their business elsewhere.,104,0
"I hesitate to give these guys three stars, but I feel that it's four stars half the time and two stars the other half, so three it is. I went there tonight for a beer after the Phoenix Suns game and actually received attentive enough service from the bar. This is good because it allowed me to try some of the great local microbrew selection. My last trip, however, I walked out due to lack of service -- same problem I've had on other occasions.",99,2

"Certainly not the most glamorous shop, Pound Savers stocks all manner of tat and this place is so big it really does seem to have everything but the kitchen sink. I could have spent hours in here browsing at all the wares, finding bizarre reasons why I would ever need half of the stuff in here. I was tempted by the colourful clay as it's been so long that I've made any clay people but decided it wasn't a very wise purchase.\n\nThis place does seem to have everything but to be honest, none of it seems all that useful but if you're looking for a tiny screwdriver, a crazy soap dish or a garden gnome you will be able to take your pick in here.",147,2
A nicer than average Starbucks that is in a weird location. I wish the one on Eastern was this clean and friendly. I just wish these guys were closer to me!,35,3
Excellent service and a cute little place in historic Glendale. Beautiful little tree-lined street and a lively patio. I had the tomato mozarella sandwich and tomato noodle soup. Both were very good. I'll be back for lunch.,49,3
Worst pizza I've had it's insane how they managed to still stay open,18,0
"This place was fine, but that's all we were expecting. It's their 24 hour, we have it all cafe. It's kinda greasy spoon, but you have plenty of options on the menu for things that won't clog your arteries. \n\nWe enjoyed the cobb salad (dressing on the side, folks!) and teriyaki bowl when we got in late Friday. Then on Saturday we split a spanish frittata with egg whites..the coffee was decent. \n\nSeriously, it's what you'd expect. Not fine dining and not a Denny's either!",129,2
"This place has potential to be a great location for family fun, however, the lack of service (extremely slow) and the quality of food is much to be desired.\nI had a party of 5 and we got seated quickly but it took no kidding 10-15 min for a server to come to our table. \nAfter a bit you just stop asking for things because it takes so long.\nThe layout of where the dining in relation to the kitchen or service booth is too spread out.\nThis place has the starting of a good thing but I probably won't come back. The first time I gave them the benefit of doubt but the second trip pretty much made the decision for me that this is how gameworks operates.\nSo, in my opinion just come here for the games don't come here for the food. It's just not worth it.",183,0
"This place STUNK! Figuratively... I think the customer service, obtaining the car, was ridiculous, horrendous, incredulous!! We were waiting in line and they decided to only give good service to selective customers. We got....yelled at...By the person servicing us and he was just so rude, I had never, apart from the DMV, EVER gotten so upset. Of course, you'll be damned if you piss someone off in customer service because they will let you know! And we ended up waiting much longer than anyone else there to be handed the keys to a car that had been ready almost and hour and a half. I wish we had video cameras to record the absurd service we received. Granted, this is only for the people working here, not Hertz the company itself as I have had much much MUCH better service at Hertz elsewhere.",173,0
"Yelp 100 Challenge * 65/100\n\nThe botanical garden is featuring a wonderous butterfly greenhouse filled with fluttering eye-candy and lavish flower arrangements this spring. It looks like a scene right out of The Secret Garden movie - chairs with wrap-around leaves, hanging leaves, and of course, butterflies. \n\nTourists, this is a must-see. And locals, it's never one to be missed every season. Even with the dense crowds that never seem to go sparse even through the night, you'll get a good bite out of Vegas' more artsy side. Take lots of pictures and learn something new about the types of flowers they fill the garden with. \n\nOn the left side of the entrance is a stage that says 'live performance at 5-6pm'.

"Eh... It was ok. I had heard that it was better than In and Out so I had to try and I was not impressed at all with it. Big burgers, light flavor.",39,1
I liked the atmosphere but the noise level was not good at all.  The food was not that good either and it took 1 3/4 hours from the time we were seated until we paid our bill.  The service is really bad.  It took 20 minutes to get a glass of water.  Our waiter kept forgetting that we were even there.  He would walk by with water but it was evidently for another table that arrived after us.  We did not receive our food for an hour.  Not a place I will go back to.  They may have good happy hour prices on drinks but its not for me.  They need a new kitchen staff and at least one new waiter.  I ordered the pot pie that was very crisp and even burnt on one side.  I don't see why all the good reviews unless people like spending their time in this place without getting much service.  The only thing good was the atmosphere (other than the noise level) and the hostess.,208,0
"If you are looking for Vietnamese in the Jean-Talon & Parc Ave. neighborhood this is a great spot. They have many delicious varieties of 'pho' on the menu as well as the 'bun' dishes (vermicelli noodles with salad and topping of your choice) and are all reasonably priced. I was initially off-put by the top-40 radio playing, but there were too many positive features to not make me a repeat customer - nice booths, friendly staff (family run!) and of course, fresh & delicious food. *Recommendations - Vegetarian pho and rice pancakes appetizer. BYOB.",123,3
This a review from a vegetarian perspective. I found some stuff to eat but honestly not much more than the Rio Buffet. I go for variety at buffets and would have liked to see more. The food they did have was good but there was nothing spicy there. I did like that it did not feel crowded and the seating was good. Have to try the fresh pasta (the best thing).,80,3
"Never been here despite all the people I've heard that raved about it, especially during my LA days.  So, on my last day as an AZ resident a friend recommended we meet there for lunch, which I looked forward to with excitement.\n\nFor a Tuesday, it was hella crowded with old peeps.  I thought I'd left Sun City behind but apparently the ones that have alternate forms of transportation (e.g., a real car vs the golf cart) all descended on Mimi's the day I went.  I agree with Kimberly S on decor--super tacky.  It was like a french cafe and american diner mated & the offspring resulted in a Dennys frame with a French Quarter and generic diner inspired outfit.  \n\nThey brought out a small basket of assorted sweet breads before our meal--pumpkin bread, sourdough roll & something resembling a dark but sweet bread with raisins.  I ordered the split pea soup with ham bits--standard fare that was thick but tasty.  \n\nWe decided to share dessert & ordered the classic ensemble.  Included in this sampler were an apple crisp served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a bread pudding doused with too much melted butter, and a brownie with with another scoop of ice cream & chocolate syrup.  Definitely more sugar than one should consume in a month, even if you don't consume the small portions in their entirety.  \n\nThe crowd of demanding, cranky faced old people, slow waitress, and average food has inspired me to stay away.  Unless I'm hungry & someone offers me a free meal.  And no other places are open within a 100 mile radius.",352,1

"I visited Vdara in April for my Birthday.  It is a very nice hotel.  I took a cab from the Airport which was great because, you need a map just to find the Vdara front desk.  I had a Panarama suite which was beautiful I had a 260 degree view of Las Vegas but, to be honest, there was not really that much to see as you are a ways off the strip.  There was only one small restaurant in Vdara which is a drawback.  The only other options were to go to Aria or one of the other hotels.  Even though Aria is next door, it was a long walk and tram ride just to get there.  \n\nI found it odd that when I checked in, because I had prepaid the room and was using my Check Card, I could not charge to the room unless I left a $400 deposit.  So, I left the $400 deposit as I didn't want to pull my card out when ever I need to make a purchase.  \n\nThe pool was nice and a cabana was only $125.",242,2
"Update 10/2/13 - Well, they've fired all the good bartenders.  The owner's wife is nutso and it's gotten pretty ghetto here.  I haven't been back in quite a while.

"Pizza Up is a great lunch option that I don't think is getting the patronage it deserves.  Among all of the chains and restaurant options for lunch uptown, this place stands out - it's a no-frill, well-priced pizza shop.\n\nI've been here 3 times, and every time I've felt it was money well-spent. Here's the breakdown:\n\nFor $7.99, you get an all-you-can-eat buffet with a drink. The buffet includes\n     Pizza - NY style, pretty darn good. Options seemed to vary from cheese to meat-lovers to mushroom,peppers and onions. Ohn and they did a buffalo chicken pizza that was delicious, too. My only complaint is that they could use heat lamps to keep pizza hot and the cheese melty.\n     Pasta - Nothing special. Penne with tomato sauce. And meatballs or sausage on the side (prefer meatballs definitely)\n     Salad - Actually, a pretty decent salad bar. No complaints here\nMMMmmm we need more of these kind of lunch places uptown.  Otherwise, working here just seems stuffy",244,3
"Ew! Don't get the beef and cheddar croissant, or maybe just don't ever get it to-go! It was super soggy and wet, made me want to throw up. The sweet peppers I added gave it a little flavor, but the beef just wasn't that good. I only could stomach to eat half. I would go for an Arby's sandwich over this any day. The onion rings were good, but how can you really mess up onion rings? Am I right? \n\nService was good! They were friendly and fast, pretty efficient little routine they had going. Just disappointed in the product. \n\nI'll still go back... Need to try out their dogs. It's possible I just ordered the wrong thing.",161,2
"I told their Executive office the Studio B, had fruit fly problem. They said they would let Executive Chef Durarte know.

I stated you better get these agents back out their to M Resort, or I will sue you personally! The very next day the same agents went back to Studio B, two of four buffet wait stations were infested with fruit flies. Soda dispensers needed more through cleaning. Made them eliminate the Asian Barbecue section. And food prep area was to close to back dumpster. So unless you like eating flies I would never eat their again, period.",160,0
"Table for two was cut in half and everyone is packed against the window with people bumping into you. The restaurant is over crowded with tables and so many people you can't hold a conversation without almost yelling or moving on the other persons lap. Cocktails are $18 and $6.50 for sodas at the bar or in the restaurant. \n\n The food is really good but the portions are VERY small (except the filet it was generous but the side items are very little),  they treat you like cattle in how they pack you in!\n\n Don't sit next to the window its cramped and there is very little table space instead ask for a 6-8 person seat with even 2 to 6 people if you have 10 people they will try to pack you all in.\n\n Their tip % they ask for starts at 18% however I started at 15% and removed the $6.50 soda and $8 for two table spoons of ice cream I was charged. I know its not the servers fault for the abuse of pricing however I held them accountable.\n\nDon't order a soda and pre-game it with cocktails. I suggest ordering the Filet mignon rare its really really good and so is the Veal.\n\n Also try the hand rolled pasta side dish be sure to save room for the caramel souffle!!!\n\n Worth going up there late at night and just have the souffle and enjoy the view!",311,1

He said it's not just the best Grilled Cheese he has ever had, but most likely the best sandwich he'll ever have!!!\nMy Dad had the Crispy Duck Leg with Rice. He was so impressed with it all. He cleaned his plate and picked every piece of duck off that leg. \n\nThe Staff is so friendly and very informative of all the dishes!

"I visited on Wed. for a lunch with my lab group, per the suggestion of my lab manager.  Although this was a lab lunch, the occasion that prompted it was my birthday last week.  It's a good thing that my boss wasn't available on my actual birthday, because based on my experience here, I would have felt seriously shortchanged.\n\nDespite having a not-so-great experience at Joe Mama's (the previous instantiation of this restaurant; see my previous review) in the month before it changed hands, I was eager to give this place a second chance, in light of the updated menu and new ownership.  Upon entering, the space seemed cleaner than before, which was encouraging.  Unfortunately, however, my optimism was short-lived, since this turned out to be the most positive thing I could say about my visit.\n\nIn terms of the food, I suspected from the point that our table received the slightly-stale bread with its overly sweet oil and vinegar accompaniment that I was in for a disappointment, even though I (foolishly) continued to hold out hope.  My boss ordered the bruschetta for our table to share, which was served on the same slightly-stale bread, and was dressed with pale, tasteless tomatoes and bland pesto.  For my entree, I ordered the rigatoni al pesto, which comes dressed with a basil cream sauce with tomatoes, grilled chicken, and parmesan.  Although I love all of these ingredients, most of which are very flavorful, this dish turned out to be extremely flavorless.  Adding grated parmesan, salt, and pepper helped a bit, but unfortunately was unable to redeem it.  Moreover, the rigatoni were overcooked and overly soft, to the point that they fell apart upon the slightest touch of my fork.  The dish came with an unmemorable side salad instead of the huge shared salad bowl of Joe Mama's.  It was very clear that the ingredients used in all of the food were low quality.\n\nTo add insult onto injury, service was extremely slow.  From the time that we sat down to the time that we left, an hour and a half elapsed, despite that we only ordered appetizers and entrees.  Even my boss became frustrated with the slowness of the service, since he had to go to a meeting after lunch--he offered to reimburse the lab manager and got up to leave.  At last, our waitress must have sensed my boss's urgency, since she came by as he was getting up, and ran his credit card promptly, so that the lab manager didn't have to pay.\n\nNeedless to say, despite my initial optimism, I was disappointed with the quality of the food and service here.  While I certainly wasn't a fan of Joe Mama's, at least it didn't pretend to be upscale, so you didn't go in with high expectations.  If you're looking for a sit-down lunch in Oakland, I'd suggest The Porch, Spice Island Tea House, or even Winghart's. If you're looking for Italian food at a similar price point, I'd suggest trying Girasole in Shadyside.  I'd even suggest the Olive Garden over this place, since I've had better meals there, and at least they give you unlimited salad and breadsticks!",699,1

"This place has your standard fare and much more. For such a small establishment, I was impressed by how many things they had on their menu, including sashimi and whole flounder. It was mostly hit-or-miss -- ordering sashimi at a place like this will get you exactly what you would expect: not super fresh, but not rancid either. I had another dish that was essentially fried pork ribs in a sweet, garlicy sauce, which wasn't bad. I liked their tofu and veggie dish a lot, but then again, it's also pretty ordinary. For the price, you could do much worse.\n\nOne real exception: their bubble tea is TERRIBLE -- they heat the bubbles in the microwave so they end up really chewy and almost crunchy in the middle. Understandably so, it's not their specialty, but they charge you as much as a real boba tea place, if not a little more.",193,2
"Terrible service. Poor execution, most of the plate were not good, and it was very expensive (115$ for two). \n\nWe were a group of 12 and none of us will ever go back.

"Our last night in Montreal my hubby and I decided to try Brutopia over Dieu de Ciel. Turns out that was the wrong decision. The atmosphere here is very college  bar-y and the beers we had were plain bad. The IPA lacked any of the hoppiness that you would typically find in that style of beer. It was drinkable though. The extra blonde, on the other hand, was not. According to my husband, it tasted like corn chips. We only drank about half the pint before we decided life is way too short to drink crappy beer. Luckily our night wasn't a bust as we found ourselves on the terrace at Le Sainte-Elizabeth Pub with some good Canadian beer.",142,0

"Be careful here. You don't have any rights due to this being a Indian casino. This place took my mom winning away from her. My mom went to dinner there with a girl friend and after went and played a slot. After about 30 minutes of play a casino employee came over and asked for her ID. Once the employee had her ID he told her that she needed to come with him. After ask him why several times he finally answered. They said some lady had money in the machine my mom was playing. Witch I don't get why if someone had money in a machine why would you walk away from it? My mom put $40 in and after 30 minutes got it up to $200. Once they got into some room they took her to. They gave her two options witch were give the money back, or they would arrest her. My mom has never been in trouble and was very scared. This place must be going broke if they need to scare little old lady's and take them in a mafia style back room and press her to give the money she won far and square. Shame on you.

"My baby is a Japanese Spitz. Her white coat is like cotton with a thick undercoat.  I have had good and bad results with past groomers.  Being a new resident to Vegas, I was not sure I would find a decent grooming place.  \n\nI found Wolfgang Bakery and Grooming  through Yelp based on the good reviews. Therefore, I went to the store to check them out.  The store is cute and pink!  They have all sorts of dog and kitty goodies.  I asked questions about their grooming services and the groomer was pleasant and informative.  However, I thought it a bit rude when the groomer took a phone call, regarding an appointment, as she was providing me info and getting ready to schedule my baby for an basic wash and cut the next day. I let it roll off and moved on. \n\nI dropped my baby off and hoped for the nest.  When I received her back, she looked marvelous! The coat was short, uniformed, and nice and soft.  My baby was happy and she seemed comfortable with the groomer. \n\nIt is a small place and it is probably best to book an appointment well in advance.  In my opinion, their grooming prices were reasonable and would definitely use them again!",266,3
"I was interested in trying this place and was disappointed. The chips were stale. I ordered a berry martini. It came in a lowball glass with ice and tasted like punch. I really did not taste any alcohol. My bean and cheese enchilada was bland as well as the accompanying rice. And the portion was quite small for an $11 entree. My boyfriend thought his seafood combination was okay, however the portion was so small he ordered 2 tacos. This place has potential. I think the decor is interesting and the atmosphere is cool. They just need to liven up their food and actually put alcohol in their drinks.",129,1

And last but certainly not least - the Mac & Cheese. It was awful...just straight from the Kraft box!  And not even made well - too watery, hardly any flavor. To the waitress's credit, she did offer me another type of Mac & Cheese but said that it would take about 30 minutes to make. I would have taken her up on the offer, but I was already hungry and not about to wait a half an hour just to be potentially disappointed again.\n\nSo if I ever come back here (big IF) then I will be happy to update my review and I'll even try some of their bbq...it would only be appropriate since this is a bbq place.",231,1
"i really don't know what to say about this place.  the last time i went, ordered ramen, and the appetizer plate but it just seemed like, everything was stale and spoiled.  i get the feeling there's not a lot of foot traffic here, and i feel bad, but ..  i don't think this business will be around for that much longer, especially with Monta now in town.  i'm sorry kaigenro, but the days of serving mediocre food to locals that got excited over just the sound of ramen, is now gone.  same could be said about shuseki.  the new era of real japanese food in las vegas has begun.  (speaking about, Yagyu, Shabu-Shabu Paradise, Raku, and Monta)",163,0
Walgreens pharmacy is not very competent. They completely messed up my prescriptions on several occasions. I used them briefly cause it was convenient now I drive out of the way. Do not recommend for pharmacy services. Walgreens in general I would avoid.,49,0
"Wow! I did not expect the special creamy kale soup and Brasserie V Salad to taste as amazing as they did. My husband had the moules et frites which were equally delicious. Others at the table had the kale salad and a smoked turkey sandwich and all raved about them. Great beer and wine selection. Lots of locally sourced foods. My only complaint is the service was a bit slow at times. Overall, an excellent dining spot.",90,3
"What a night at Hakkasan Bachelor, Bachelorette, and dirty 30 BDay all in one.We got one of the best table service so far here at Hakkasan. They really improved on that.  I mean that our drinks was never empty. Our server Megan did an amazing job of filling everybody drinks, and always refilling our drink mixes also mixing drinks. This was one of the craziest night ever. Tiesto threw down an amazing set over 2 hours. Everybody in our party had a really great time, and that's all I can remember.",120,4
"I really like the wings, specifically because of the sauce choice. My favorites are Mango Habenero (spicy), Wild (spicy) , Caribbean Jerk (medium) and Teriyaki (mild)\nSpicy Garlic (medium) is also pretty good. \nThe chips with cheese and cajun seasoning is delicious. \nI almost always sit at the bar and the bartenders are great. Dani and Michelle are my favorites, but the guys on weekend swing and grave are always great too.",100,3
"How it took me almost five years to make my way to Jade Bar, I don't know... but wow! Even on a rainy night, Jade Bar was warm, cozy, welcoming, and more than a perfect place to end my week.  (Well, sort of - I still have to work through the weekend but you know what I mean!)\n\nWe sat down and Rachel came over with drink menus shortly after.  We enjoyed the company and the ambiance and I tried to decide between ordering a glass of wine and a specialty drink.  While the \""Sugar Snap South Side\"" (house made sugar snap pea infused ketel one vodka kissed with hand pressed mint, fresh lemon juice & rounded out with a dollop of pasteurized egg white) was the cocktail that was most appealing to me, I went with a glass of Argentinian Malbec instead.  (I'm choosing wines from Argentina lately to gear up for an upcoming honeymoon!)\n\nBy the time we finished round one, our table was ready and we moved on to dine at Elements... but that will have to be another review!  Stay tuned... :)",235,4

"I went here last Friday on my way to California. The wait at lunch time was about an hour and I just wasn't impressed.  There seemed to be a lot of staff just standing around and not much food was coming out.  Our meal took forever to arrive and my chicken sandwich was over cooked.  The place reminded me of a glorified diner.  It's not a place worth driving out of my way for as I live on the opposite end of town.  \n\nIt was good to try once just to see what the hype was about, but it didn't do it for me.  While the waitress was friendly, she wouldn't stop talking....put in the order already!!",148,2
"Stopped in to get breakfast after reading Yelp reviews.  Sandwiches were yummy and really fresh.  My husband got a lunch sandwich and loved the kale salad that came with it.  Great coffee as well.

"By far... this place kicks ass when it comes to great sandwiches in and around the UNLV area. Although the prices are a a bit high, they do make up for it in sheer size. Mind you, this is not exactly the place to come if your on a diet as these sandwiches (at least the ones I order) would make any personal trainer wince. \n\nBetween this place and capriotti's across the street, they have the sandwich market around UNLV pretty well covered.",104,3

No bueno. Not happy *again*\n\nNext, this is a burger place HOW IN GOD'S great earth do you run out of KETCHUP. That's just a plain old sin! That should never happen= bad planning bad management \n\nBurgers and ketchup are like best friends.

"Pretty pricey for what you get, too dark with too loud music that you can't actually talk to your friends, really weird and off-putting menu items... \nI got the FEZ burger (grilled angus burger with spicy honey molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, lemon garlic aioli, crispy onions, & cilantro) which sounded really weird but intriguing. The spicy sweetness of the BBQ totally overpowered everything else -  I couldn't even taste the pears and lemon garlic which were two of the main eye-catchers in the description. It tasted just like any other BBQ and onion burger. I also split the rosemary garlic fries with my friend and they were basic fries sprinkled in garlic salt - way too salty to even taste the garlic.\nI was not impressed. \n\nAlso, I really hate at restaurants when you ask for a box for your left overs and the waitress takes your plate out of your sight instead of letting you put your own food in the box. All she put in was half my burger when I had bits of the other half and salad also on my plate. Super peeve of mine!",230,1
"Well, the reason businesses are successful over time is that they provide good customer service and encourage repeat business. I bought an online deal to try this place in our neighborhood. I tried several times to book a \""reservation.\"" Once they were not open on the day we could come, one time I had to call so many days ahead of time etc. Needless to say, once my party of 4 could come was the day the coupon expired. They couldn't \""fit me in\"" during the 8 hours of business that day nor could they honor the coupon for an extra 24 or 48 hours. She tried to convince me that getting half the value of the coupon should make me happy. Well, if you don't want to extend any effort to future customers, not only will we never return, we will ensure that everyone in our neighborhood knows of this negative experience as well.  The cost of providing a few more samples of wine to honor a coupon and attract more business and new customers would have been worth your cost. As for me, I'm done with start ups using group-on and living social to attract business.",234,0
So I found this place on the internet and it looked great and over the phone the man I talked to ( Robert) was just awsome and helpful that's about where it ends. On the day of my wedding I call there 2 times to confirm a few thing ( nervous bride) both time I got some Indian lady who was not helpful but did tell that I better not be late for the limo or they would charge me a late fee! So I make sure everyone in my party was there on time when I get a call letting me know my limo would be about 30 mins late to picking me up (do I get to charge them a late fee) the driver was nice.  When we get to the chapel the ladies were nice enough and told.me how pretty I was but I felt really rushed about how everything was going to work no real run through or have a private moment with my dad. \nI was asked would I like a nonreligious or religious ceremony and chose religious but do not really any mention of God . The ceremony was rushed and vague then when all was said done I was given a envelope to which I was supposed to give the Minster an extra 60 dollars as gratuity that I was nothing about and had borrow money to pay it ! When I went to order my pictures they where loaded wrong on the web site after I called and fixed that I did get my pictures back in a good time frame but the picture was horrible !  They looked they were printed off a computer and the one that I prefer as my big picture was cropped off and lopsided! I would not send anyone to this place ever.,336,0
"So glad that they opened up a Vig in my neighborhood! Huge fan.  The atmosphere is fun and cool but not trying too hard, and the servers are always friendly.  The food is consistently good.  I'm a big fan of their deconstructed fish taco salad and the vigan sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, delicious! \n\nIt's definitely not as big as its counterpart - it has bocce ball but is missing the awesome patio - but it's also not as crowded, which is nice. I've been to both locations several times and this one seems to be more low key, even family friendly, than the original Vig which always seems to be verging on the edge of Scottsdale douchebaggery.  \n\nTheir new menu is really amusing, too, give it a close read sometime.",176,3

"I've had a few good experiences here, getting my mountain bikes serviced. However, last time I was in there. the service went from professional to amateur. I simply wanted my old pedals and odometer swapped off my old bike to a new one. The young kid helping me kept telling me they were slammed with weekend work tickets. No problem, I was planning on leaving the bikes at the store. This was Tuesday a.m., wanted the bike back end of day Weds. He kept telling me there was no way they could promise that. Fine, but this was a only 20 min job. I don't fault the young kid, he was just doing what he was told. It was his boss/manager, working on the computer, who seemed thoroughly annoyed with every question the kid would throw his way about my needs. Not once did he seem interested in helping me, nor did he even take a moment to turn around to greet me and behave like a manager or professional should. \n\nI left and took the bikes up to Bike Masters at San Tan mall. Scott told me he would be happy to do it right now. They also had bikes they were currently working on, but he went out of his way to take care of me in less than 20 mins. I expected to leave the bikes and pick them up later. This was above and beyond.",285,2
"I don't give 5 stars often. But this place was awesome! Their French toast is bomb! My wife and I ordered two dishes, we could have fed 2 more people with their massive portions. The food is fresh and freaking delicious! They only have Tabasco if you are looking for cholula or tapatio. We managed with the hot sauces we wanted. The French toast was the best I ever had no kidding. It was good! I'm not a French toast king of guy either. Nice place to go off the strip for some breakfast. Our server Kelly was super nice and accommodating! Will definitely go back when I'm back in Vegas! This place is not over rated, trust me.",148,4
"We went in for what we thought was going to be some good Italian, wrong! I had Speight and Meatballs, It was like being in High School, HORRIBLE!

I thought with a name like Mancuso behind it, well you get the picture. I hate to say it but Olive Garden was better, now that's scary!",112,0

"The only thing this Von's has going for it is that it was on my way back from grubbin' at In-N-Out across the street.  I've never had to pass through a turn-style to get into a grocery store - what exactly is that about? I understand the neighborhood is a bit on the sketchy side, but I've also never seen an entire aisle locked with gates - you need to have an employee unlock the gate if you need anything in the personal care aisle.  Maybe this shouldn't be held against the store in general, but it gives me a weird vibe.  \n\nWhile I was checking out, the cashier initiated a conversation about the economy and recession, making comments that not everybody can afford groceries anymore and how her personal financial troubles caused her home to lose value, etc.  She seemed very angry.  While I can definitely sympathize, it made me totally uncomfortable.",192,1
"After posting a less than favorable review on this business, the owner felt the need to reply to my original review saying that he will \""pray for me\"".... which isn't something a professional business owner should say to his customers, especially when word of mouth is one of the best proven methods for advertising.\n\nThe food was actually quite good enough to consider eating there again, but sadly, based on his awful attitude and lack of empathy for my less-than-stellar experience, he made me decide not only to NOT eat there ever again, but to make sure none of my friends do either. \n\nFor a business that hasn't been open that long, you'd think he'd have a better understanding of what customer service (and YELP) is all about.",165,0
"To save a little bit of dough, my lady friends and I decided to camp out at the HRH (as it likes to be known). Of course, we didn't realize an inch on the map means a mile in heels to the main strip. Can you say ouch?\n\nWith distance aside, it was like staying at a rock n' roll memorabilia museum slash night club extravaganza. \n\nYAY:\n- Plenty of restaurants but mostly on the \""meh\"" side\n- Great displays of costumes, instruments and pictures of Johnny Cash, Santana, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson etc. Btw, X-Tina was a tiny thing judging from her \""Dirty\"" video costume \n- Fluffy fluffy fluffy pillows. No really, FLUFFY PILLOWY HEAVEN\n\nNAY:  \n- Our rooms had dirty glasses and a full waste bin when we strolled in. Tsk tsk housekeeping\n- They tacked on an extra $20 a day \""resort\"" fee that included \""free\"" wi-fi, access to the pool and I swear they said ice. Seriously? That's sneaky business not to include this in the room fee and they should have made it clear when the reservation was first made with a travel agent\n- Constant party-rocking in the pool area. It was utter madness. It felt like MTV Beach Party/Spring Break/Girls Gone Wild Parts I-X. It also felt like a pool side audition of Jersey Shore. We escaped to the other pool where people were a little more sane but you could still hear the pounding music and drunken roars. Also negative? They kicked us out at 5 pm when there was obviously still daylight. Ex-nay!",357,2
"This is not my favorite Costco, the lines are long, employment seems low and its kind of dirty. \n\nPlus the stocking is not that great they stock some items off and on, or don't order enough not to run out. Like those awesome tortillas from new mexico, but nonetheless Cheap Gas, and Milk and avocados still attract me.\n\nOne time I had to listen to the political views of a boneheaded cashier and nearly complained to upper management. But he shut up when his coworker warned him and it was more fun just to glare at him and make him feel uncomfortable. Overall Costco is a decent store, so I would give it three stars but this is one of the crappier ones I have been in. The Robinson store is much nicer.",159,1
"This hotel and casino for sure fits into the old school vegas.  It's still vintage like something out of a movie.  When I first entered I walked through the food court.  Yeah I said it...a freaking food court, it didn't even feel like i was in vegas, maybe some small town's mall.  The neon lights were mostly faded showing of signs of wear and tear.  \n\nSo why was i here? My friend was in a pool tournament, the BCAPL National 8 ball championship.  Their pool room is actually not half bad.  I know nothing about competitive pool but it was interesting to see all them playing head to head and only missing at the most 1-2 shots a match.  \n\nIt felt like EPSN on sunday afternoons without football.",173,1

"Sushi Samba is amazing!   Forget trying to order from the extensive menu.  Instead, just tell your Server the type of Sushi or Sashimi you like, your level of \""experimentation\"", and your price range.

Your eyes will roll back in your head with pure ecstasy!   Note: Bring about $200 or more (for two people).  It's not cheap, but I would rank this meal as a top 10 of all time!",139,4
"Truth be told, I've never had great BBQ at Memphis Championship and I've eaten at three different locations here in the city. Generally speaking I find most of their meats to be on the dry side and sometimes even cold-ish. Not sure if they have trouble timing thier butts and brisket or just do one batch of meat a day then keep it barely warm? The smoky flavor is always there and the sauces are good enough, just seems to be lacking freshness and expertise, cooking time wise. \n   I went for a quick lunch today with a co-worker and had the burnt ends(Smoky brisket chunks)and the fries and salad. I think I actually go here more because I like the thick-ish friesand crisp side salad and high quality blue cheese dressing more than the meat itself which is kinda sad for a BBQ place. Again the flavorful burnt ends were kinda cold and certainly been sitting a while. This is not a dish that is gonna be fresh and juicy but Ive had these at many superior BBQ places where they retain a bit more moisture. \n The service at Memphis is always quick and rock solid on my visits. Just wish they'd pay a bit more attention to the important thing...the meat.",251,1
I am sorry to say people of Mesa you must have pretty low standards if this is the best sushi bar in Mesa. I went there last night and I really did not think it was that great. How can anyone say great service when the servers cannot tell you the different sakes they stock. One of the servers barely spoke any English. Another one went to get my soup bowl and reached across me without asking if it was okay to do so. \n\nThe Uni was actually pretty good but really was not impressed with the tempura. The Hamachi was served with skin on it which I really do not like. I do not see what is so special about the Miso,139,1
"I've visited this Biersch location several times over the years, for varying reasons.   More often than not it was to relax on a Friday after a completing a long and strenuous week of formatting excel spreadsheets.  Their happy hour is good for beer.   There are several \""speciality\"" cocktails which are available as happy hour specials but they are mostly very sweet, fruit based concoctions.  I'd much prefer to be able to just get a $5 jack and coke, but that's just me.   None of the happy hour food offerings are exactly groundbreaking fare, but most of it is tasty and a steal at the happy hour prices.  The best of those options to me are the Southwest Combo which comes with Pork sliders, southwest egg rolls and the famous garlic fries.  Also the tapas for $5 are a steal for the flatbread with hummus and some other dips/toppings.  None of the mediterranean restaurants around town should be shaking in their boots over the quality of this plate, but it was certainly better than I expected it to be when I ordered it.   \n\nI've also been a few times for lunch, and the last time I went I tried the Moroccan salmon entree.   The salmon was well cooked and I really enjoyed the spices used in the preparation of it.   I tend to prefer my salmon to not be smothered in a lot of sauce or spices that mask the flavor of the fish itself, and this version pleased me in that respect.   I don't remember the price point but I did think it was maybe a few dollars too expensive especially during lunch (it wasn't on any special lunch menu), but ultimately it was worth it.\n\nWhat sets this location of a chain that specializes in 3 star food IMO is the service.  95% of the time I've gone the service has been excellent.   Drinks are refilled quickly, and the waitresses are very friendly even when we're being loud and obnoxious after our 4th round of beers and asking for the channel to be changed on one of the many TVs around the bar area showing various sports.  And that basically sums up my happy hour needs in a nutshell.  Biersch succeeds",459,3
"This is a good option for a quick bite, couple of steps up from your regular fast food restaurant. You can select the size and toppings (good selection). The fries and onion rings are average. If you are into old school milk shakes they have a vast selection of flavors and you can create your own combination. The place is clean and large so I can't imagine someone will have problems finding a table. It is great for kids and large families. The staff is very friendly. Prices are fair. Parking is also not a problem neither. So, as I said, this is a great option for a quick bite if you are not in the mood for one of the traditional fast food places, but you can get better (gourmet) burgers somewhere else in town. Ohh no alcohol beverages, so if you like to enjoy a burger with a beer..well not your place. I didn't try the deserts, but I enjoyed a nice strawberry/hershey's chocolate milkshake.",202,2
"Call me slow for not checking Yelp before going there, but since I has first seen Nadine's on Diner's Drive-ins and Dives, I assumed it was a family restaurant. After walking quite a while down the strip district in the freezing cold with 2 kids, I discovered that Nadine's is actually a bar. Kid's can't go inside. Unfortunately for me, this meant I didn't get to partake in the goods.\n\nFor those wondering about the rating - Yelp doesn't give an option to provide feedback without a rating so I put mine smack dab in the middle. \n\nSo, for people with kids: Don't even try.

"This was my first time ever booking a hotel online so I would like to point out some tips for nubcakes like myself: \n\n1) Even though you're booking a night for the same exact day, online prices will change from week to week. Keep that in mind when looking for a deal. \n2) Booking a hotel from its actual website will only give you access to the highest available price they offer. It's best to scrounge around for some other sites that will allow you to book at other hotels. \n3) Hotels do not reserve your non-smoking or smoking request (either that or Rivieria doesn't do that at all). \n4) There is a hidden facility fee (at least Riviera hid this from me) that they will charge you at the front desk when you check into your room (it costs around $9). \n\nNow that my online-hotel booking cherry has been popped, let's talk about the Riviera. First off, it's one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest) main hotels on the Las Vegas strip. I paid $128 for a night (not including the hidden facility fee). However, you really get what you pay for. \n\nThe rooms themselves have a relatively effete view of the strip. However, the beds are comfortable enough. The room service is average and I had no idea where to get extra towels. They have a pool but no jacuzzi! \n\nI had the opportunity to eat at the in-house buffet which gets a two star rating from me. My most memorable moment involved me raising my hand to get the waitress' attention as I was absolutely parched. She looked at me and said, \""Don't you do that.\"" My cronies and I were in a curious quandary because we could not figure out how I was being rude. Her rude attitude continued for the entire time we were there. Now every time I raise my hand for anything, my friends will promptly look at me and say, \""Don't you do that.\"" \n\nThe food itself is typical of a veritable plethora of buffets: average. If anything, always forage for a section that includes a chef cooking food right in front of you. Fortunately, this buffet had such a chef. This convivial cooker served us some sumptuous omelets. I responded with a dollar tip for his services. However, the only tip I gave that  feckless waitress was a note saying \""Get a new job.\"" Zing!",525,2
Found this place because its close to work. I wish I can go here for lunch on a daily basis but my budget wont allow it! Sushi is always fresh and the staff is very friendly. I've had their all you can eat sushi($20) for dinner and managed to eat 3 rolls. Great deal if you ask me because each roll can be around $9-14. They have tons of rolls you can choose from. Also the complimentary fruit is a nice touch and makes you feel special. You will be glad you visited.,113,3
"It's been 4-5 years since I have been to Via Brasil and had no plans on coming back but my friend kept ranting and raving about how good it is,  so one day I was to lazy to go all the way to TDB so decides to give it one more shot.  I was disappointed again and paying nearly $50.00 was just not worth it. A few days later went to TDB and it was great as usual for the same price. The quality of the food and the ambiance is night and day. \n\nI have to say that I will definitely not be going to Via Brasil again!!!",134,2
"Luckily I don't mind Coke....  I have been here several times and it's been... \""meh\""... but the last time I came through the drive thru and ordered a simple Medium #1 with onion rings.  I thought it was strange that the order taker did not ask what I wanted to drink, but just drove around (figured he would ask me when I got there).... NOPE just handed me a coke.  I try to roll with the punches more-often-than-not, but this was not the end of the world for me.  When I opened the bag, I had fries... and mentioned it to him.  There was no apology and he just went and got the onion rings and handed me the bag back.\n\nI guess  the phrase, \""you get what you pay for\"" applies here.  I will probably give this place another shot since it's right near my house when I need a BK fix, but this is very disappointing in my book.",208,1
"The salmon at this sushi house is TO DIE FOR.  Salmon Kama, Salmon sashimi, I Love Salmon Roll.... all of which are dreamy!  The kama is crisp on the outside and lusciously velvety goodness on the inside.  The sashimi is divine and melts in your mouth.  The salmon rolls are quite tasty too, if you're in the mood for sushi. \n\nOn the other hand, I'm not  a big fan of their non-salmon sushi, and the seaweed salad is a little underseasoned.  \n\nAnything fried is good though - soft shell crab, tempura, etc.  \n\nThere's all you can eat for $20, but with almost every hour of every day being half-off happy hour, there's always a good deal to be had here ;)  [Additionally, they have listings on restaurant.com too]",191,3

"I stayed at the Planet Hollywood Towers for CES this year.  If you're looking for some sort of Vegas experience don't stay here.  But if you're desperately in need of lodging or if you're looking for somewhere a bit more quiet, the PH towers are a good option.\n\nSo, I found out that I was going to CES this year two days before CES.  This doesn't allow for much time to plan and doesn't allow for many options for accommodations or flights.  After scrambling to find a hotel and doing some hardcore sleuthing on google/kayak/orbitz/travelocity/farecast/etc, I can up empty handed.  Empty handed being Circus Circus, Stratosphere or off the strip hotels (everything else was solid booked) and a $780 non-stop flight from Oakland to Vegas or SFO to Long Beach to Vegas with a 6.5 hour lay over (again, all other flights were solid booked).  Fail.  I considered driving.  Or not going.\n\nI couldn't not go, however.  Some intensive googling (read: 4th page of results) led me to a shady looking hotel broker site (http://www.bookit.com, slogan: \""You know what to do.\"")  They had rooms available at the PH towers, and not only that, they were 40% off.  Of course this was a scam.  Or was it?  I called PH reservations, they said \""we're all booked\"", I said no, the *towers*, they said oh yeah, plenty of room.  I said why.  They said, uhhh it just opened on December 28th and nobody knows about it.  (It wasn't even listed as a hotel on hotels.com, travelocity, orbitz, etc).  I went back to bookit.com and \""booked it\"" hoping that I hadn't just screwed myself.\n\nWhen I arrived in the carport area of the Towers, there wasn't a single person or car in sight.  Hmmm.  I went inside (everything was brand new, uber modern theme) and up to the lobby.  At the front desk there were spots for 20 reservationists but there was only one person there checking people in.  When I got up to desk, she looked up my name... long, anxious pause... she pulled it up, and everything was fine. \n\nSome stuff about the Hotel that the website or brochure won't tell you:  The towers are mixed residences and hotel accommodations.  The main entrance is located off of the back end of the Miracle Mile Shops--a mall of questionable quality and curation.  It's a 10 minute walk from the hotel to the main PH casino and hotel.  There's something that looks like a bar in the lobby of the Towers but I never saw anyone there.  There are no restaurants.  There are no usual hotel amenities--spa, starbucks, gift shop, etc.  The pool area looks more like a public swimming pool and faces one of the main roads off of the strip. Room service has limited hours and it made me wonder where the food comes from since there's no dining establishments in the Towers. \n\nOn the plus side, the rooms are brand new studios, 1 bedrooms and suites.  My studio was small by hotel room standards and average by Manhattan apartment studio standards with a view of the MGM but not the strip.  I think I might have been the first person to ever use the room.  It smelled like cleanliness and there was no sign of anybody ever having occupied the space.  The room came with a kitchenette, full set of dish-ware, a dishwasher, full wall to wall, floor to ceiling windows with a remote controlled shade.  The linens were stiff and nice.  The bed was firm.  The towels shed lint everywhere, I presume from having never been washed and dryed before (they were brand new).  The toilets are black, which is weird (use your imagination). \n\nOne of my favorite parts of Vegas hotel rooms are the completely opaque shades that can make 2pm seem like 2am and help you recover from something that may have ended at 7am.  Take note Empire Today... make shades that block out all light. \n\nOk, I should wrap this review up, but I thought I'd provide a little more info since this is *hopefully* the first review of this hotel.",955,2
"From previous experiences, this had become one of our favorite Chinese food restaurants in the valley.  We went here for dinner tonight with high expectations.  Tonight's visit was unbelievably disgusting!  It started off with us receiving dirty silverware only to be replaced twice by none other than some more dirty silverware.  Then the plates we received were dirty and had to be replaced as well.  As if this wasn't disgusting enough, as we were eating, my boyfriend found a dead spider in his food!  We brought in to the attention of the manager and he offered to bring us more food but who could eat after that? Needless to say, that was the end of our dining experience and we will not be returning.",147,0
"This club is OK. I got a few lap dances from this sexy little school teacher, stripper. Out of 15 girls, only 3 girls were hot. Not what, I really expected for a Las Vegas stripclub. Inside, it is freakin HUGE. Personally, I think there are hotter girls in Deja Vu, in Vegas.",70,1
"Pet owners beware!!! They took my dog while I was out of the room...My husband and another couple recently had the misfortune of staying at this awful hotel. We brought along our two dogs as we normally would. We travel often and always take our dogs with us instead of boarding them. Upon checking in we signed a form agreeing not to leave our pets in the room for an \""unreasonable amount of time\"", which in our minds meant several hours and the hotel staff did not specify. After getting unpacked and ready for the evening we left for dinner. We were maybe gone 45 minutes at the absolute most when the hotel called my husband and said that one of our dogs was barking and we must leave dinner immediately and return to the hotel. We called the waiter over had him box up our food and we left. When we got to our room and walked in the door one of our dogs was missing. I was already worried because it is very out of character for either of our dogs to bark and be a nuisance. My friend and I hurried to the front desk as our husbands continued to search the room for the dog. The staff was extremely rude to us and told that security had removed the dog from the room and we should be grateful that they did. I would have had no problem with that BUT if they were capable of calling to demand that we leave dinner then also tell me that you are taking my dog for a walk. Do not let me return to find him missing. I tried to explain why that was upsetting and that I love my dogs as if they were my children and the lady said good parents wouldn't leave their children unattended in the room. Then I was told that the pet policy we signed meant that pets could not be left in the room alone for even \""one minute, because even that was an unreasonable amount of time\"" and it was \""Hilton policy to remove animals from the room at their discretion whether their owners were notified or not.\""  Then after waiting for ten minutes security came walking up with my dog, held out his leash, and asked who is responsible for this animal. At that time my husband and my friend's husband began to lose their tempers, but who wouldn't in a situation like this? We had enough and asked if we could check out and if they knew of any other pet friendly hotels. They suggested one, so  my husband walked over to check in while we were packing up the room. Apparently the Hilton called the hotel that they had suggested and told them that we had an unruly pet and to beware of renting us a room.  As that was taking place across the street, my friend and I were packing up the room and all of the electricity in the hotel went out. It was pitch black. We went back to the front desk and was told that it was a planned black out and were given two glow sticks. So for the next four hours we had to sit in our room with no electricity and two glow sticks. I called the manager several times that night to try to settle the matter, but no one answered or called back. It took a week and a half and a nasty message from me to finally get a response. I was told that we could not receive a refund because they had to give 3 other refunds because of our barking dog. I'm sorry, but if anyone deserved a refund it was us.",687,0
"This was incredibly disappointing.  I drive by this place almost every day on my way home from physical therapy, so when it was featured on Doozy of a Deal, I jumped at the chance to buy a coupon. \n\nMy husband and I came here after hiking in the McDowell Mountain preserve. I had the Mediterranean omelet with a pancake and he had the malted waffle with a side of home fries. My omelet was good, but the cooks foiled my attempt to make it healthy by cooking it in oil. I literally picked up the omelet and put it on a napkin, and the napkin soaked up its oil. Gross. My pancake was very dense and kind of dry. Not light and fluffy like pancakes should be. \n\nMy husband's waffle was pretty pathetic. Also dense and flavorless. Here's the scary part: the server dropped off the syrup and it was all frothy...we tasted it and we think it was fermenting. If they use real maple syrup and don't refrigerate it, then it will ferment. We had our server bring us another bottle and that one was better. \n\nOverall we will not be returning. We would both rather go to iHop than Over Easy.",257,1

"Wow, this is a nice new place with great service! I bought a month pass via Groupon and just after redeeming my first day, I realized \""DAMN!\"" I was going to be out of town for 2 weeks of the month I just purchased. I mentioned it to Ashley, the manager there just to see if there was anything we could do about that, and she went above and beyond to work with me so I didn't lose those weeks. THIS is great customer service, THIS is how you gain and keep customers. I'm very grateful for her help. On top of this, she ALWAYS remembered me as I walked in the door, even on my second visit! I never waited longer than a minute for a bed and the place is spotless. I will continue to come here even after my month expires. Just takes one act of good customer service to change a new customer into a repeat customer. Thanks Ashley! See you again soon!",195,4
"I woke up feeling absolutely awful. I was able to get in right away & I was seen by the PA,  Michelle Wine.  She was so sweet, and was able to tell me my diagnosis,  call in my prescription & give me notes for work/school. My insurance referred me & I am very happy that they did. 100 times",75,4
"Madison has a lot of Lao/Viet/Thai places, but lets face it they mostly suck.  At least that's what I realized once I tried out Ha Long Bay.\n\nThey have an intimidatingly long menu that I have not begun to sample in my several trips but The Pad Thai and Sesame Chicken dishes I have had were both good if a little sweet.  The Vietnamese soup was pretty good.\n\nThe best part for me has been the appetizers.  Every cheap Chinese place has a crab rangoon or fried pot stickers on the menu but I have never had better rangoon-like fried items than at Ha Long Bay.  The Dumplings were also quite tasty though recently they have been more greasy and poorly formed than they were when the place opened.  The spring rolls were also excellent.\n\nAlso though it should not be a factor I have to give them props for replacing the 'Cajun' place that preceded it, that was one of the worst restaurants I have been to in Madison and the current occupants of the location do it much more honor.\n\nbtw, on one trip we were there a little late but our young waiter very obviously got baked in between bringing us courses.  It did not improve his waiting skills and our order immediately got messed up but it was hilarious so I suppose he get a pass.",278,3
"Just say NO NO NO to HO HO HO!\n\n\nI made the mistake of using their restroom after I had just placed my order for garlic shrimp.\n\nIt was dirty, the sink had black dirt residue it was so filthy and the bathroom is also used as a storage facility. Although they had toilet seat covers in boxes, they were not stocked for use.\n\nI was on lunch at work and decided on the garlic shrimp w/lo mein soft noodles.\n\nThere was very little shrimp, it was mostly water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and mushrooms. I really think it should be named garlic mushroom because that was all it was.\n\nThe lo mein noodles were even horrible as they were way too salty, thick and dry with zero flavor.\n\nThat was my first and last visit!\n\nI have had some bad chinese food in the past however this really is the worst I have ever had no doubt!\n\nIt is an insult to associate the word gourmet in any way, shape or form with this disaster of a \""chinese\"" restaurant.\n\nNEVER AGAIN\n\nMY MISTAKE FOR NOT READING YELP REVIEWS PRIOR TO VISIT AS I HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

"Make this part pf your old classic Vegas tour.....\nHow much do I Love the Neon Musuem???!! OMGosh it was so fun, different, interesting and cool. \nThe Boneyard was so fun to take pictures in. We went last February and so the weather was great, not too hot or cold.  \nWe also took the recommendation of the tour guide and drove along Fremont Street East to look at all the still functioning Neon signs, which was a fun little drive at night.\nI also was surprised by how many people from other countries were on the tour, which I thought was even cooler. \nJust up Las Vegas Blvd North from the musuem is THE best casino in Vegas, Jerry's Nugget. Seriously, we gamble here every day we're in Vegas because it's old school Vegas and I always win at video poker here. Plus the coffee shop has great food (see my review).",196,4
"I loved Crave.  It didn't seem like the type of place I'd ever go, but I've been fixated on martinis lately, and I wanted to go somewhere I hadn't been...and it's not far away.\n\nI had a Lemondrop and a metropolitan - both were great :)  The bartender was doing bar tricks, lighting things on fire, etc.  It was fun to watch.  \n\nAltogether we ordered my 2 Martinis, 1 Sidecar, & 1 Whiskey Manhattan - altogether about $36 ?  Not bad at all.  I'd definitely go back.  Some of their food items look good, but we didn't eat.",156,4
"Terrible food. And they wouldnt let us pay our own bills because they thought we are thieves trying to \""Dine and Dash\"". \n\nWe demanded to talk to the cashier, and then the supervisor, and then the General Manager (some old white lady) who all said that we have to pay together instead of separately. \n\nWe are COLLEGE STUDENTS with part time jobs, we just came from a party for the Japanese Student Association of UNLV. Of course we can afford your shitty $6 pasta alfredos. Second, theft is not within our moral code as innocent students. Third, if you wanted us to leave TOGETHER then don't tell us to do this at 3 o' clock in the morning where we are all tired and want to go home. \n\nSome of us, have priorities like a job, or classes, and we just wanted to have a quick meal. \n\nStop making really bad food too. I made 3 bathroom trips within one and a half hour of being stuck here.  One of the waiters tried to stop me from going to the bathroom. I guess his grumpy ass thought I was trying to run for it. \n\nWe weren't being obnoxious, there are plenty of seats and dining tables around us, and WE ARE PAYING. Since all of us were getting pretty sick from the Alfredo Sauce, Pasta Sauce, Pizzas, and poorly made dishes, one by one we started to go up to the cashiers counter to pay for our own dishes and leave early, only to be turned away at the front door. \n\nI started noticing a pattern, only females that complained managed to pay and leave, and the rest of the dudes were only allowed to leave together. By that point, I started making a scene on the Host/Cashier's Table for the restaurant, threatening to accuse them of being sexist and claiming that they are calling us thieves until they finally let me pay for my own bill. \n\nThe amount of bullshit that I had to go through to eat here was fucking insane. I have never been to a dining location where I, and my peers, are viewed as fraudsters in the back of the minds of the entire staff as we entered. We didn't come inside in hoodies and waving Glocks in the air. We wanted to fucking eat. \n\nThe staff wouldn't let us leave. They served us food that gave us the shits. And they tacked on undeserved gratuity on our bills.",524,0
"Certainly one of the best offered here in Phoenix. With 5 different haunted houses and lots of ghouls working the event, you can tell there is a lot of work put into it. It's almost a whole night event if you don't go with the fast pass. Each attraction you wait in line for.

"I have mixed feelings about what I think here, been a few times, like a lot of the food on the menu especially the nachos, pizza is awesome and tried the burger and was content!\nAlthough the service is not always the best, few times we walked in they told us the kitchen was closed ( 10 pm Saturday night) that we can go to the bar..\nAnother time they dint want us to go in the dinning room cause it was apparently closing and we had to sit at the bar with the loud music.\nAnother time we asked for an appetizer and it wasn't cooked ( was frozen in the middle)\nWell ok they were nice about it, gave us another plate for free but still it turned me off completely! I've been to other boston pizzas in mtl qc and had better service!\nThe one in lasalle is being managed by young careless people!\nI give it 3 stars.",193,1
"It's just not very good, it used to be better but never was really good. I remember when it opened and what a big success it was immediately. I never understood why it was so popular, it's what I call a 10 year restaurant. That's a place where I eat and don't really like the food; then after 10 years of people telling me how good it is, I think maybe I missed something. So I try it again and am reminded why I did not like it the first time, 10 years ago.\n\nWe ate here again recently because it was open late. The meal was disappointing as usual, nothing was terrible but nothing was good either. We only ate about half of our meals and did not get containers to take the leftovers home. It's kind of pricey also, about $100 for two, definitely not worth the money.\n\nLas Vegas is not a great town for Mexican restaurants like LA or San Antonio are; tacos yes but restaurants not so much. There are however two places in this same part of town that are far superior and cheaper than Lindo Michoacan. El Ausente and Hacienda del Rey are much better choices and better values as well.",258,1
"I love Guy Fieri but if he likes this place, he may need to get his taste buds cleaned, stripped or completely replaced because I ordered New York steak and Shrimp with cole slaw and Baked Beans for sides. My daughter ordered mild chicken fingers and fries and my hubby ordered the New York steak and shrimp with the same sides as me. We also ordered the Antipasto salad and the 1/2 lb shrimp basket with fries. We took everything to go, because we didn't want to sit there with everyone staring at us like we were the next meal. I expected to hear dueling bajos playing any second after walking in there. \n\nLet's start with the steaks, they were completely over done. My hubby ordered his med. well and it was murdered beyond belief, dry and not seasoned. Where's the salt and pepper? At least the 5 shrimp that came with it were good but whatever breading was on them was soggy.\n\nThe cole slaw was good but we never got our baked beans and didn't want to venture back in that dive to tell the chef he made a mistake, it was too scary. \n\nThe antipasto salad was not what I expected. There was lettuce and lots of it with what I'm assuming to be ablout 1/2 of a diced tomato, less than 7 pieces of ham, about 9 slices of salami, 3 tablespoons of sliced black olives and a handfull of cheese. Not my idea of antipasto salad. \n\nThe chicken fingers were probably the worst of the bunch. I asked for mild chicken fingers, so what did they do? They took their sauce and sprinkled a tiny amount on the fingers. Who does that? So I'm guessing, if I had ordered hot chicken fingers there would have been a lot more sauce on them? They were a joke. \n\nThe 1/2lb of shrimp and fries were hard, stale and it should say 'popcorn shrimp' because that's what it is. There's more batter than shrimp on those things and they are hard and dry. The fries tasted old and stale and unsalted. \n\nNext time I'll just go to the grocery store and cook at home.",469,0
I ordered a crown roast a week in advance of Christmas. I went to pick it up late afternoon on Christmas Eve. I was informed that they didn't have it. I had promised my Christmas guests crown roast.

"I've been here before, but it was a while ago and the first couple times were mediocre. I decided to go here again out of convenience and I thought why not. I had noticed that since the last time I had been there,  they lowered the prices a bit. Lookin good already, I thought.  I proceeded to order the number 1 combo,  which is their ground beef kubideh. The guy who rang me up was very pleasant,  not just to me,  but to the others who were there. Perhaps they saw their negative reviews? \n\nYou need to try the rose tea and sour cherry teas. Delicious.  I got my order and jeeze, I don't remember the meat being this juicy and flavorful. I remembered it being slightly dry. Maybe the lunch hour has a different staff because dinner here was great. The yogurt was perfect, the bread was fluffy, and the rice was buttery. All very delicious. I could probably go without their salad though.",209,3
"A quick bar update: when I was here over the weekend, I noticed that they are now offering a frozen mimosa with Sunday brunch.  During my visit, they were also offering a new cocktail on special.

"I was driving on a road trip from Ohio to Virginia and my parking brake light turned on while I was on the highway, so I figured it would be safest to pull of the road and have it checked out before I kept driving; this one happened to be the first one off the exit.

He saw that the brake fluid was low and added some fluid for free and then put my car up on the lift and inspected the brakes just to make sure.

"This was my third time, and I just keeping chasing the high that was my first time at Arrogant Butcher. Looking like I will never get the quality that I got the first go around. I ordered the scallop dish and the first time it was amazing. One of the best all around dishes I had ever had. The second visit I ordered them, and they were raw in the middle. Fluke perhaps? Last night I gave it another go and the vegetables were undercooked and the scallops were chewy. Sad, really. I seek out restaurants with consistent food quality. This is another to add to the list of unpredictable, sub par meals. \n\nPlus side: Waitress was friendly and relatively fast. The Pinot noir wine offered is one of my favorite bottles ever.

"I have traveled to 15 countries and have seen some amazing sites, the wailing wall, Vatican, Eiffel Tower to name a few and this was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. This is not supposed to be a \""sick man\"" type of exhibit, as some people mention in other reviews. It is an extremely informative and real life look at our bodies, inside and out. I wanted to be a doctor so I have always been interested in physiology, but I think this exhibit would be interesting to most intelligent people. I was shocked at a few of the ridiculous reviews on yelp..... but I wont waste my time stating why those people are so ignorant. My husband and I had a plane to catch and we nearly missed it, because we were told we would need about an hour but we had to hurry up because we could have easily been there for 2. I have a good understanding of the body, but seeing it up close and personal was an experience I will never forget. The process the bodies go through for preparation is also incredibly amazing.

"Whenever visiting my Vegas family, this is where we stay. The Silverton.

All I can say is that it's definitely reasonable.\nSince coming to the Silverton & the Shady Grove Lounge since it's inception, all I know is that the service is top notch; the pool table seems to be refelted on a regular basis & a plethora of flatscreens to show whatever games happen to be on at the time.\nWe always tell friends & family to meet up here as it's always a great place to kick just before heading out. Mind you, the Silverton has several other hotspots for you to check out...\nIt's not just for locals...us out of towners like it just as well.\n\nI'll certainly be back in a few weeks & a few weeks after that...and so on...\n\nI approve this review: deez\u00ae out!",269,3

"I came here looking for the very prive peep toe in nude and of course they didn't have it at all. I guess the shoe was so popular that it's sold out everyone, which was almost true.

Thank you Thank you, now my shoe is coming soon. I can't wait.\n\nI think the sales lady was very rude and just had this attitude that she's high class or something. Making comments where if I didn't get the black one that it's impossible to obtain the nude one. For god sake you work at a retail department store!!! For what customers are paying for the shoes, they can at least be nice about it because the price is no joke. It ranges from $600 and up.\n\nBut 5 stars for the shoes itself, so beautiful!",243,0
"The Pandas have entered the building.\n\nAnd like that, the newest bar to hit the New Town bar scene opened its doors. Walk down the carpeted staircase and you suddenly come upon a basement level speakeasy bar, with bartenders in tweed tartan bow ties, waistcoats and the most impressive of facial hair.  This is certainly a bar with distinct style, and class (where did class go to, anyway?)\n\nThe thing I liked the most, immediately, was that it's well lit and warm; not 'mood lighting' that makes it too hard to see your dining companions. It's warm mood lighting, that shows off the vintage inspired interior perfectly. Including the two barber chairs up the back...\n\nFor this a vintage barber-inspired bar. I'm beginning to wonder whether impressive facial hair is a requirement of the bartenders here. The toilets have moustaches painted on the mirrors for the chaps (so I'm told) and the ladies have hairstyles to 'try on' via painted mirror images. The barber chairs. Other vintage elements include a bill in a 'Fishermen's Friend' tin, and candles placed in men's hairwax tins.\n\nThe cocktails definitely have a speakeasy taste to them. Short, served in sherry glasses, and with quite the punch. The Bamboo was a delightfully dry sherry and vermouth concoction. Small, but mighty (and very reasonably priced at \u00a37.)\n\nI see hints of the now-shut Raconteur, but in a whole new imagining. It's a new bar to hit the Edinburgh scene, not connected to any others, but well supported within the Edinburgh bar scene. \n\nMy advice is go here sooner rather than later, before it gets very popular and crowded, so you can admire all the beautiful attentions to detail that make it the bar it is. \n\nI raise my Bamboo-filled glass and toast good luck to this newest bar!",419,3
"Staying at the Aria and stopped here for an early dinner as soon as we arrived on Christmas Day.

We ordered the salmon spring rolls for an appetizer. These were top notch...salmon, cheese, and basil fried in a slim roll with sweet chili dipping sauce. I ordered the Pad See Ewe (spelling?) at a spicy level 3 out 10 and the man ordered Pad Thai with Chicken at level 5. The Pad See Ewe was just ok, I'm not sure it was meant for spiciness and it also needed more veggies! The Pad Thai was excellent! \n\nOnly real issue was the bartender, who doubled as our server.

You think that's bad? There was also puke all over for the whole entire night that the staff said they weren't going to waste their time cleaning up until bartime. DISGUSTING. The bathrooms stank of piss (I believe it was all over the floors), the sink lever was busted, the towel dispenser was on the ground under the sink.... There was even a bloody tampon sitting on the sink!!!!!!!!! I am going to report this place to the Health Department as soon as I get a chance. How can you even operate a business like this and then refuse to take care of the mess after being asked numerous times? How can you just stand around when there are biohazards all over your damn restaurant? I think I've said enough...",201,0
"In a nutshell: a Japanese Cirque Du Soleil without too much of the drama that no one understands.\n\nI went to Vegas for a quick weekend getaway, and wanted to find some show to watch. Being an avid fan of Cirque Du Soleil, I've seen almost all their productions on the Strip (except for Viva Elvis, which I have no interest in.) Then I came across Matsuri. Tickets were reasonably priced, so I thought I would give it a try.\n\nThis was truly a pleasant surprise. Think Cirque Du Soleil, scale it down, but add HOT japanese gals (and guys, but that's not really my thing). The music was upbeat, and doesn't seem like a Cirque Du Soleil ripoff. Very nice Asian flare to everything. The Oiran girl was super cute! Basically all the girls were cute. And I'm not even biased towards Japanese girls.\n\nThe tempo was fast, and there were no boring moments. The clown acts were interesting and timed just right. The parts that required human muscle performance doesn't seem to lack behind Cirque Du Soleil. And since they don't have over-done makeup like CDS, it's easy to see how excited and energetic the performers were. Also, since there were relatively few performers (I think about 8 guys and 8 girls), they constantly change costume and do back-to-back acts. it's amazing how much physical endurance they all have.\n\nIf you like acrobatic and a great experience, I strongly recommend Matsuri. kid-friendly. The ONLY bad things I can think of are that 1) It's short, only about 70 min. long (I want more!), and 2) It's at ghetto Imperial Palace. The parking lot stinks. I also had Hash-House AGoGo afterwards there, and the service sucked.",390,4

I am not from the area, so, to see a bloody done right like this is a treat, and almost a meal!  I had the prime rib sandwich, and although tasty, I thought it could have been trimmed a bit better so it wasn't so chewy.\nI wish I could come back more often to experience the rest of the menu and the large tap selection.",121,4
"So after an amazing All-You-can-Eat Korean BBQ lunch at Honey Pig next door, the boyfriend and I stopped by the bakery before heading to the outlet mall.  I had seen this tiny bakery when we were pulling up next to Honey Pig.  Being the elitist baked-good snob ever, I decided we had to stop by after lunch.\n\nAs soon as I stepped in, I found a lady and a man frantically packing/wrapping up various buns and sweets.  Service, to say the least, wasn't exactly the best considering I was standing over the goodies all by myself for the whole duration.\n\nI ended up buying various sweetened buns, pastries that looked like bananas, bread with hot dogs, croquette, and other stuff.  But my absolute favorite purchase was the Butter cookies.  It was love at first bite. My boyfriend really enjoyed the chocolate cookies dipped in chocolate.  \n\nObviously, I'll always stop by when I'm in Vegas again.  Afterall, I totally think about the Korean move, \""Antique [the live-action of the anime Antique Bakery]\"" whenever I stop by.  And now I raise my glass of pomegranate-blueberry-lychee sake, \""Cheers to L'Epidor and the handsome man behind the counter!\""",275,4

"Room\nWe arrived around 11am on 3/10 and checked in with Joshua.  He was very nice but seemed inexperienced with your systems.  We returned to the front desk and was greeted by Hilary.  The email from VIP Services and the room we were assigned did not seem right.  I showed Hilary the email and after 30 minutes of trying to talking to VIP Services, she assigned us room 61224, which she said was an upgrade to a \""penthouse suite.\""  The light switch in the bedroom and reading light were not in working order, it took 3 calls to get them fixed.  Thought out the stay we had to keep asking for glasses.  Housekeeping would only leave one in the bathroom and one wine glass by the mini bar.  After the second night, we bought plastic cups.  Janet was to give a $50.00 credit for a miss understanding that a member of the desk staff told me. She also, was to have the signed receipts of the bar charges.  When checking out, well you guessed it, she did not give the credit nor did she have the receipts and she was gone for the day.\n \nCasino\nHad an issue with a machine it would not take our money nor give us our ticket.  After 20minutes or so we stopped William.  He called Sonia.  She came over and fixed the machine.  Kudos to the both of them!\nWhile playing Roulette, we tried to get drinks from the cocktail server but there didn't seem to be one.  We asked Stacey, who we thought was the pit boss, to call a server.  He told us, he was just a fill in and can not do that.  I had to go to the bar to get our drinks, oh well. The dealer, Paul, was the reason why we stayed at that table for over 5hours and dropped a few thousand dollars. \nChristopher, another fill in, gave our players card to someone else, not sure if he even gave us credit for our play.\nThe last night, we played some Roulette with Gina - great personality and very funny but the best was Sheri, the blackjack dealer and Sean the pit boss.  We played blackjack until 4am.  Sean told us we had at least $130.00 in comps.  I thought that was low due to all the time and money we spent at the tables.\n \nPlayers Club\nOn arrival we meet Egar and Darius - two great guys.\nOn check out - we only had $108 in comps.

"This grill wasn't really for me. I went with other people who liked loud places like this, but it's not really my style. The food wasn't too bad, but the service was pretty poor.

I ordered the Count skillet expecting all of the ingredients, eggs, mushrooms, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes to be baked together. When it came out I had 2 eggs over easy on top of all of the other ingredients. I was slightly disappointed, but I guess I should have looked at the menu more closely because that's what it said they do. The ham was also cubed here vs. sliced which between the two was the reason I didn't enjoy the skillet as much. \n\nThe service was good, albeit slow, due to our group size.

"The food was awesome, the service was horrible. \n\nI got the Alambre tacos sans bell peppers and it was one of the best things I've tasted. The tortillas were perfectly thick and soft, the meat wasn't over-cooked, and the bacon and onions were a perfect compliment. The complimentary chips and salsa (comes with three types) were great, too - especially the verde sauce.\nMy mother is on a restrictive diet so she asked the waitress if it was possible to get a side of vegetables instead of beans and rice. We expected a nice selection of squash, corn, peppers etc. (as are listed available for their vegetarian options). However, she received a bowl of what looked like canned mixed vegetables. Nonetheless, everything else on the plate was fine.\nPrices were a little higher than your average Mexican restaurant, but what I got was quality, so it's worth the few extra dollars.\n\nIt took way too long to get our order taken and our check given, and then the waitress gave us the wrong change (short $10!) and it took awhile to get her attention to fix it. While it was dinner time (6-7pm) on a week night, it was not busy at all. \nI would go back just because my tacos were so great tasting but I will have to try a different location to see if the service is more timely.",290,2

"This review will encompass experiences both at the restaurant and the music venue upstairs; I have never purchased anything from the gift store on the street level, so I implore you to look elsewhere for reviews for your over*priced tshirt, hat and commemorative pin-buying needs. \n\nThere is no free parking for this property, so I usually park at the outside lot that Monte Carlo has (between MC and NY, NY), or earlier, when I had the patience to walk through the annoying MGM Grand, in that parking garage. MC is your best choice since it about a block to the door. \n\nVenue:\n** out of *****\nIt's called Hard Rock. HARD rock. Someone explain to me why the first time I patronised this venue, for an AAF concert, they were tossing people out for consentingly mildly moshing. No one was crashing into anyone that wished not to participate. No one was going to fight. It was all supposed to be good fun. People were being tossed out. Keep that mind if you ever get the urge to do so, or if you are vehemently anti-people having fun and prefer for staff to throw people out for doing something that is normal at an AAF show. As I walked out of the venue, there were Metro police officers rushing up into the property; for what, who knows. Luckily, it was not kill-an-unarmed-civilian-night on the Gillespie calendar so everyone got off unscathed. \n\nI never stuck around to see another set from an artist/group that would generate moshing, so I do not know if this was an isolated policy incident. I have seen about a dozen or so other shows after my first here. \n\nAs others have said, the search is fairly intensive for Las Vegas, but nothing intrusive. It's no big deal to me; those doing the searches are always pleasant and in great spirits/moods.  \n\nRestaurant:\n* out of *****\nI ate 1/4 of a monster salad once; I cannot recall being asked if there was anything wrong with it (I probably was not), and when I was asked if I was done, I said yes (imagining [WRONGLY] that I would be presented with a box or that it was taken away to be brought back in a box) and it was taken and presumably put in the collection for the pig farm. The salad was quite good (for a place named 'Hard Rock') but I will never forgive my salad being thrown away as if I were some shithead tourist with the inability to take it home. Actually, I see shithead tourists with gigantic doggie bags all the time on the strip, so essentially I was treated worse than a shithead tourist. \n\nNever forget the death of my over*sized salad. \n\nAdditionally pointless ancedote for those still reading: once I was brought a check that was a mere fraction of the bill I had incurred. A dinner for two (me) was confused with a small bar bill or something (not me), so instead of whatever I was supposed to be charged, I was given a SUB 10$ bill. Instead of being a dick and causing someone to be docked or worse (fired), I brought it up so that I could pay what was right. - E",697,0

No life around after dinner, everyone goes to bed, they have a bar, but it is empty at 9:30 on a Friday and Saturday night. The horseback rides were boring. You can only walk, and they say you can trot but you really only trot for about 50 feet a few times on a two hour ride. I was told they do team penning on either Friday or Saturday and that is why I went here, but they didn't do it. There isn't a hot tub or Jacuzzi either, not even at the spa.

"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.  The woman who was working at the front desk @ 3:30 AM Saturday, May 25, 2013 from Chicago, IL (that was all I could get from her name tag on account of how tired my husband and I were making the 9-hour journey to LV) - YOU DESERVE TO BE FIRED.  YOU DESERVE NOTHING BUT THE LACK OF KINDNESS/CONCERN YOU SHOW TO OTHERS.  \n\nBut let me start from the beginning: my husband and I decided to go to LV for a nice, relaxing Memorial Day weekend.  We decided to drive from San Jose, CA because our original plans fell through last minute - typically this is a 7-8 hour drive, but because of all the traffic from vacation-goers, and deciding to leave during rush hour (after my husband got off of work), our drive ended up taking over 10-hours.  Fast forward to arriving at the hotel: we arrived at 3:30 am, early Saturday morning and to say that we were exhausted is an understatement.  There were plenty of front desk personnel for so early in the morning (or late at night) and there were plenty of people checking in as well.  After waiting in line for about 10-minutes, it was our turn to check in.  We were met with a standard greeting and asked our names for the reservation.  After giving the front desk personnel our name, she proceeded to get on the phone and to check to see \""if rooms were available\"" - even though I had called two days ahead and told them we would be arriving after 1:00 am.  At the time I called the gentleman on the phone told me there was nothing to worry about and that he would include a note on the reservation.  After the woman got off the phone, she told us the ONLY room they had available was a KING, SMOKING room.  This was TERRIBLE news being that I am EXTREMELY ALLERGIC to cigarette smoke.  Now before someone goes on to rant \""why would you be in Vegas when you're allergic to cigarette smoke???\"" - I try my best to avoid those who are smoking and I don't gamble, so I never stay in a casino more than to just walk through... other than that my husband and I chose to drive around most of the time and we only go to Vegas for the shopping - this cuts down my exposure to offsetting my allergies (these are personal decisions we make and planning ahead like this helps tremendously for our lifestyle choices).  \n\nBack to the story: the woman proceeded to tell us there was \""absolutely nothing\"" she could do and did not even offer any other offer (I wouldn't have minded paying extra for the night to get us out of smoking room - but she made it seem like it wasn't even an option).  Meanwhile, the man checking in next to us was offered a SUITE when the other front desk staff told him the only room available was a smoking room - he didn't want a smoking room because he had children (totally understandable).  When I told her I was allergic to cigarette smoke, she asked to give her an exact medical condition and she would \""look it up.\""  When I told her allergies were a health condition in-in-of-itself, she went on to say, \""well I get itchy eyes too around cigarettes.  It's too bad.\""  THIS MADE ME SOOOO MAD.  I reminded her I called a couple nights ago and asked them to make a note - my exact words were: \""I asked you guys to make sure we would be accommodated.\""  THEN SHE SAYS \""No, not \""you guys\"" it has nothing to do with me - you told the company and they are currently out of rooms.\""  SHOCK.  That's how you treat customers?  That's what you say?  Do you enjoy throwing salt on the wound?  My husband and I were so tired and she wasn't worth making a scene over... but the result?  I currently have an infection in my eye stemmed from \""an allergic reaction\"" and my body is in hives.  Thank you Treasure Island.

I had a grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with buffalo sauce chicken tenders - hmmmmmm and I had a sushi burrito that was delish too. But waited over a hour at each booth.

"When I first met my (now) wife, this restaurant is where we went on one of our first dates. The service was good and the food was fantastic. It was a very memorable experience for both of us. Last week we returned to Montreal for the first time in three years and were eager to return to our favorite Chinese buffet. \n\nTo say we were disappointed would be a massive understatement. \n\nThe food looked like it had been sitting out for days. The vegetables were brown and spoiled. The sauces were syrupy and disgusting. The meats were nauseatingly greasy. The store-bought steamed buns were so old they had fused with the paper they were sitting on. \n\nThere was not one dish I can honestly say I enjoyed... and I tried a LOT of dishes. Normally I'd feel guilty at a buffet if I didn't eat everything on my plate before going back for more. Here I felt like I was doing the next guy a favor.\n\nThe place is now wallpapered with advertisements for an assortment of absurdly extravagant alcoholic drinks (we're talking umbrellas, dry ice, and fruit wedges). I have to assume pushing these overpriced novelties is their focus now - serving good food certainly is not.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting. The only redeeming aspect is how quick they are to refill your drink... and you're going to need a lot of refills to wash the taste out of your mouth. Avoid.",303,0
"Don't be fooled as you pull up to Umami. The restaurant looks like an normal house on the outside, but inside there is a small bar and about a dozen tables inside. \n\nUmami's bar has a nice selection of sake, sake mixed drinks, and a good selections of beer. It's not too big, but it's big enough to mingle and make some new friends. One thing I didn't understand is how you could not take your bar tab to your table. The bartender made me close out and pay before sitting down to order food. \n\nThe food was decent. Nothing to write home and tell everyone to fly out to Madison to try their food. The best thing we had were the steam pork buns. Pretty traditional. Nice steamed bun, with a nice slice of pork belly served with scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce. The dumplings weren't anything special. Tasted like frozen pot stickers from the store. We had an order of pork and shrimp, and I probably had a total of 3 whole shrimps in 4 potstickers. The ramen was decent. I'm glad we ordered the other food because this is probably the smallest bowl of ramen I've ever had. Noodles were cooked well, but I think i had two strips of bamboo shoots and half a cup of noodles. The tonkatsu soup was lacking on the pork flavor. It had a good color, but was really light on the fatty pork flavor.\n\nOverall, Umami was delicious for the area and it could be a lot worse. If I am ever back in Madison and I need a bowl of ramen, Umami is the place to go.",351,3
"Have you ever gone to a steak house and lost weight? If you haven't, try BLT, as you'll not take home a doggie bag...ha. Is it also bad that the best part of the evening was the background music? I love me some Dobie Gray :) \n\nWent to BLT for restaurant week today and was not impressed unfortunately. I'm from Chicago and love steakhouses, and have spent my fare share of $$$ on Charlotte's finest ones. BLT doesn't rank in the top 5...sorry. \n\nDetails: Ordered the beefsteak salad, hanger steak (med rare) and the tart dessert. Sides are included (all 3 of them). We had a party of 4, so I of course asked the size of the sides. The nice waitress said \""family style\"", which was acceptable though I asked her if Id get the same amount of sides if it were just two f us, and she said yes. I then asked (with a smile) how many sides we'd get if there were 6 of us, and she said 6. I pointed out the math didn't make sense, but said I could order additional sides off the menu if I'd like. I thought to myself that I'd just bring more people next time. \n\nFood was average. The sides were in a small dish. Trust me, small, and if you've been to any other steak house, you'd agree. Hanger steak was more rare than med rare, though I don't mind. Flavor was pretty good. Unfortunately the experience was sub par and I won't be returning. \n\nTIP: Hotel bar and restaurant bar have different liquor licenses, so make sure to finish your hotel bar drink before going into the restaurant.",383,1
"Let's talk about the weird interaction I had with a Barista here.  I asked if they offered free internet.  Simple question, right?  She hesitated and then went on this whole diatribe about how it used to be free, and then it wasn't and now it kinda is, but she wasn't sure.  I swear that's exactly what she said.  So she hesitantly gives me this paper, pulled off from a whole stack mind you, of the Internet name and password.  At this point I'm confused...do you not want me to be here?  Is it free?  I finally got my answer when I logged on with no issues, it's free.  Why all the hassle??\n\nThe only reason I can see (and seriously a big one) is the coffee shop hanger on-ers.  I can only imagine how this has become an epidemic in spots like this.  Hip spots with lots of students and recent grads who want to scope out the free internet havens.  I get it....the coffee shop wants you to get your coffee, hang out for approximately 2 hours and leave.  I'm sure this is not the case...and that people hang out enough that they could easily put on an apron and handle orders behind the counter.  So long story short, this place is PACKED.  Packed like you usually have to take a couple laps to find a free table....or even lone chair!  It's a little annoying. Plus, you're most likely going to see what the person next to you/on top of you is doing.  Oh, sweet game of chess there dude....\n\nOh yeah, my chai was okay, Oregon Chai Mix (my third fav after a homemade mix or Intellegentsia).   Made exactly how I ordered it, extra hot, which a lot of people do not do correctly (it needs to burn my tongue, for realz).  \n\nBut for me, this is a spot I'd avoid....way too crowded!",435,1
"So the basics was that my dog got hurt at the dog park and I needed to take her into a vet asap! Since our normal place is in California I had to rush to find a place before the weekend started. That's where Dewey Veterinary Medical Center came in. First off the staff was very friends, from the ladies at the counter to the vet. Everyone was nice. Also, it was nice to be seen at such short notice. That's where the good things stop. I had to wait almost 3 hours from the time we got there to when we left. Also, the charge was a lot higher then I had previously been told it was going to be. Another negative for me was that it was inside of the same building as the ASPCA (or some kind of place like that). All the noise and craziness made my poor dog even more nervous. Overall, I'd probably only go back there in a pinch if I really needed to but otherwise I'm in the market for that above and beyond vet that doesn't charge an arm and a leg!",222,2
"I don't need to endlessly pontificate on this one; some of the best Neapolitan pizza in the Midwest.  Brutta is easily up there with Spacca Napoli in Chicago, Punch in Minneapolis and Il Ritrovo in Sheboygan.  Their commitment to local ingredients, ie. Iowa Prosciutto, Midwest flour and vegetables from the Dane county area, make them truly unique amidst similar restaurants.  The space itself is casual and efficient.  The prices are great.  My one complaint is their beer/wine set-up.  Each time you want a refill you gotta get back in the line (often reaching to the back door) just to get a refill.  Now, I've worked in the industry long enough to know that you can make some good dough (pun intended) on alcohol.  Why make it so difficult to get a refill?  Perhaps they could put a busser on filling drink orders?  Or maybe allow drink orders to be filled at the pizza takeout counter?  Either way, they really ought to rectify that...nonetheless, I won't let it taint my 5-stars.",233,4

"What a gem of a place! Family owned & operated.\nTake your favorite bottle of wine with you as it's a terrific BYOB spot. \nWe ordered one entree & the ingredients were so fresh & vibrant. The broccoli & broccoli rabe was perfectly cooked & crunchy.  The bean sprouts were large, white & burst with flavor in your mouth.  The chicken plump & perfectly cooked.  They err on the side of hot in their recipes as we had a level 2 & it was a fairly hot flavor. We have both traveled to Thailand & thought we were tough but I caution to get 2 or lower.  \nWe enjoyed our bottle of Chardonnay while we ate.  We enjoyed it so much that we ordered the same recipe to go!\nAs a lighter dessert we got the coconut ice cream with fried bananas.\nPerfectly delightfully light & sized to share. \n\nThe ambience is delicately decorated with Thai artifacts & impeccably clean. \nThe bathroom was super clean, painted a cool silver & smelled of orchids. \nThe door to the kitchen was open & I peeked inside & it was clean & everything was in its proper place. I was very happy to see that.   \n\nMy only question was the audio ambience. There were not many tables occupied & it felt a little desolate that music would fill the vacant space. I remember hearing a little but then it was off.   The only other concern was the clarity of the menu. \nMy date did all the ordering so I did not browse the menu but he said it was really confusing to the new customer. \n \nWe stayed a few hours & by that time there were a few more tables occupied. I was happy to see that. \n\nI highly highly recommend this place. \nHow we learned about it was on a recommendations from a stranger on a Piestwa  Peak mountain hike. \nThank you kind stranger.",404,4
"Recently visited this restaurant for the first time, and was nicely surprised on many fronts. There were four of us in our party and we wanted good food in a relaxed setting that wasn't too noisy. We arrived for our 7 pm reservation and we were promptly seated by the fireplace in a very nice carpeted room with about 16 tables. A nice respite from the high ceilinged marble floor places that are the norm these days. \n\nWithin moments of being seated we were given some bread and ice water...and a little bowl dip with some crostini and bread sticks...love bread sticks. The menu is very traditional Italian, no surprises. They have a table d'h\u00f4tel starting around 25 and going to 40. Pretty standard Italian fare but prepared well and served with a smile.\n\nWill return here again.",182,3

"3.5 stars\n\nRemember when Hot Pockets were the best invention EVER? Well now there's a restaurant that is totally dedicated to a fancy hot pocket filled with tasty treats! Yup, Cornish Pasty Co!\n\nAfter promising myself that I would try this place for way too long, I decided to go with a co-worker for my first visit. For my first trip to CPC, I chose the Tikka Masala pasty. It was pretty good! I guess I was hoping for a serving of spicy, somewhat creamy, and savory tikka masala served in a hot pocket. What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.\n\nOn my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good! The meat was juicy and a little grease was dripping out of the pocket, which meant that it was nice and juicy! \n\nWhenever I am tempted by a hot pocket, I make sure that I head to CPC for a well made, tasty, more sophisticated version!",284,3

"02/07/13\n\nFinally stopped by to visit Jeff at the new place-- I was a huge fan of Truckin' Good Food.  I was hoping to make it to the restaurant after my acupuncture session, but that ran long, and by the time I arrived here, it was already closing time.  However, Jeff did not send me home, even when I said I'd be back in the area in a couple of weeks.  He asked me if I drank coffee, and I said \""yes, preferably black,\"" but I also drink cappuccinos from time to time.  He asked me if I knew what a cannelle was, I said yes, and after setting me up with a mug of drip coffee, he went into the kitchen to surprise me with something fabulous.  (If you've met Jeff Kraus, you know he always has his thinking cap on, creating recipes of great-tasting food while you and he speak!)\n\nWhile I waited for this lovely surprise, I surveyed my surroundings and admired the wall art, all made by local artists.  I fell in love with the counter backsplash the moment I laid eyes on it.  (Blue is one of my favorite colors.)  I really like the energy here, and I hope to return very soon to check out their dinner menu-- the resto re-opens at 5 pm, and last seating is at 730 pm.  \n\nThe cannelle tasted fantastic!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cr\u00eape-bar-tempe?select=7WOcX83WBMjpC5twU_wRcg#7WOcX83WBMjpC5twU_wRcg  The pastry was caramelized on the outside and had a lovely \""done\"" texture, while the inside was akin to a souffle's custard-like interior.  In fact, this product made me think of a deconstructed souffle.  The cake was sweet enough by itself and didn't need the extra vanilla glaze, nor the caramel sauce, but I tried them out anyway, since Jeff was generous enough to create them for me when he and crew should've been busy closing up shop in preparation for dinner later in a few hours.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet a nice young man, Dylan Brabec,** whom Jeff introduced as part of the genius team responsible for the lovely photos (on Crepe Bar's FB page) and videos (I could not find this on FB, sorry!) of the recent latte throwdown held at Crepe Bar.  The photos portrayed a very fun occasion, of which I wished I was there to witness in person!\n\nThank you for your very kind hospitality, Jeff, and I WILL be back!  :)\n\n**You may check out the latte throwdown video, as well as Dylan's collective team's other work, at royalanddesign.com.",629,3
"One of the only pizza places I get really excited to visit. It has a lot of Italian-American food...calzones, lasagna, strombolis, and they're all freaking delicious.\n\nMy favorite is the mouthwatering double-deckeroni pizza. Double pepperoni, a spicy pizza sauce, and an awesome cheese blend that sends my taste buds straight to heaven, arteries be damned. For the purists out there: Yes, we know it's not *really* Chicago style, but who cares when it's this tasty? You can always get the thin crust.\n\nThey also have an extensive beer selection. They boast 110 brews, and you can take a \""world tour\"" of beer. Basically, you can record every drink you order on a membership card, and when that's done, you get your very own witty one-liner on a plaque in the waiting area. Really cool concept, but I offer some criticisms--too many of the beers are stuff we've already had. Do I really have to drink one more of the same domestic drafts to make it? What a chore. There's another list for the various martinis they have, but unfortunately those are hit or miss.\n\nThis is a great place to stuff your face, get a nice buzz, and watch the game. Shout out to the waitress that introduced me to Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. She gave this review just enough of a boost to give it four stars.",311,3
"This is not our first visit to Kona Grill.  We've been a few times to this one and the one in San Tan Village.\n\nToday we went for lunch.  We took advantage of their free bonus gift card offer, and decided to use the bonus card.  We ordered a spicy tuna roll from the sushi menu, treating as our \""starter\"" (their menu starters just didn't appeal today).  Then my wife had the pan asian noodles, and I had the Kona meatloaf.\n\nBoth dishes were good.  The meatloaf was an Asian/fusion interpretation, and was pretty tasty.  They also served a reasonable block of meatloaf.  The sauce was nice.  It came with green beans (which were mediocre...just beans, no other flavors) and mashed red-skin potatoes (which were good, but ordinary...no garlic or other flavoring to punch them up a bit).  The noodles were a stir-fry soba thing with beef and vegetables.  It was good also, a very typical Asian stir-fry flavor (with ginger).  Nothing really noteworthy, but good.\n\nIf you want Asian/fusion food, this place is pretty good.  You get a better value at happy hour (and reverse happy hour).  But we haven't had a bad meal there yet.",278,2

"Guy Fieri isn't exactly the most refined of the Food Network lineup of stars, but you would at least expect something decent if it has the dude's name attached to it. I mean, I have yet to be disappointed by any of the restaurants featured on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives that I've visited.\n\nWell, so much for his namesake restaurant. Prices are in line with similar Vegas restaurants. That said, for the amount of money you're dropping, and the fact that the place carries a food celebrity endorsement, you'd expect a lot better quality food.\n\nHad the bacon mac & cheese burger, and it's a fantastic burger in theory. Execution, however, left a crap-ton to be desired. The burger was dry (not moist & juicy) and clearly flat-top fried and not grilled. Then they serve it to you on this narrow wooden plank, which certainly looked cool. But when it's a big, messy, burger, the serving plate was utterly useless. The fried goodies it came with were also served in an odd manner -- wrapped in wax paper and suspended from an aluminum-wire thing. Super messy -- all form, no function.\n\nPortions were, no surprise, massive. But when you consider the food was mediocre, it was just a plate full of blah. Ignore the Guy Fieri hype. No need to bother with this place.",298,1
"This place seemed a bit run down and their business was rather slow compared to spearmint rhino or sapphire but we decided to come here anyways for our buddy's bachelor party. Apparently, they have male strippers on the floor above us and that may have affected the quality of the strippers here. \n\nAfter being approached by a dozen strippers, I felt I needed to run off and approach strippers that I was physically attracted to, as did the Bachelor. After getting the Bachelor a few dances, it was our turn, so I ended up getting an amazing dance by a Costa Rican named Emmy.  I tipped her well and rejoined the group. \n\nNow is where everything went down hill. I was approached by a stripper named \""violet\"" who was not physically attractive at all. She kept pulling my hair aggressively, choking me, slapping me, and feeling on me as I politely told her I was not interested in a dance. She told me I needed to tip so I grabbed a few singles and gave it up. \n\nAs I put my money away, she reached into my pocket to grab the stash of ones and said I owed her more than that and walked off with my stack of 20. I tried to grab it back as she aggressively robbed me and walked off. \n\nI then spoke to the club  manager, Anthony, and he spoke to her as she spewed her lies and poured poison into his ears. He was able to retrieve half of the money she stole as she told him I was feeling on her the entire time. Look, if I wanted a dance, I would buy it from a bombshell, not a retired cam whore who probably couldn't make a living on her physical appearances. \n\nThey get an extra star for having some good dancers who never approached and the corrective action management tried to instill. But hiring thieves who reach into pockets to take what they feel like makes this place rather primitive. Please do yourself a favor and hit up sapphire or spearmint rhino instead. You'll see many many more bombshells there instead.\n\nProps to the manager Anthony for at least attempting to straighten out some of his more ratchet strippers.",458,1

"This place has great, friendly service.  And yes, the free after-dinner (or before) chocolates at the hostess stand are delicious. \n\nThe Gauchos do not use Brazilian Portuguese terms for the meats... this was kind of disappointing since I was expecting that part of the fun learning experience.  Even if they have to explain what they said, that's part of the fun.  To skip this aspect seems... lazy.  \n\nAnyway, the Picanha is called \""house special.\""  The bacon-wrapped filet mignon is CLEARLY the best choice; DO NOT waste time or stomach space on chicken. The sausage was ok, definitely not the tastiest part of the meal, nor the best I've ever had.  It wasn't even second or third best.  I'm not a fan of lamb, so I skipped that choice. The porterhouse was pretty good, but I suggest you ask for medium rare or medium since the well done cut is kind of a waste (and it wasn't very good).  \n\nWhy waste room on the salad bar?  However, if you do, you'll find it has great options: asparagus, sun dried tomato, green olives, chilled grilled zucchini, spinach, lettuce, greens, tabouleh, etc.  They offer a free cheese bread; IT'S A TRAP!  Yes, it's REALLY good.  But that's how they sucker you into eating that crap instead of the EXPENSIVE MEATS!  The lemonade is more like limeade; it's very tangy, and I needed to add sugar.  The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very good, large even for two people.  It's a nice way to top off your meal if you still have stomach space and failed to eat enough meat. \n\nDo yourself a favor and be sure to make a reservation.  Immediately after I was seated, I saw a tour bus full of Japanese tourists come in with their group and I was really thankful I had made a reservation.",448,3

Just recently, they shrunk (quite badly) a cashmere sweater and not only refused to offer any type of compensation for the sweater, but they did not even apologize. \n\nOn top of it all--they are extremely expensive. I thought the price would correlate with the service, but it certainly did not. \n\nDo not go here.",152,0
"During Thanksgiving break, this was one of the places that we took the kids to see. My sisters kids didn't mind the entertainment with the mermaid floating around in the aquarium and seeing the different kinds of fish. My son and my sisters of course had to point out the flaws with the mermaid though. For example, the little ones thought the mermaid was real. My son told them that she was not since she had goggles and a nose plug. Then my sisters just had to point out that the mermaid had stretch marks that were visible. Talk about being a little embarrassed with a full crowd around. LOL. Anyways, we had a great time being together and laughing. The only reason why I gave a 4 star review was because the show was short and not much of an entertainment. The mermaid floated around and waved to everyone.

"I am certainly not a chicken and waffle aficionado, but I thought that Lo-Los was worth going to at least once.  Both the chicken and the waffle came out very hot, and tasted as though they were cooked for my order.  In addition to the aforementioned chicken and waffle, I ordered a side of cornbread.  Just like the waffle, the corn bread was pretty good too.\n\nI can't complain about grease because I was eating fried chicken.  But, the waffle and cornbread came with what I thought was a crazy amount of butter scooped onto them.  Lo-Los is hardly a health-food restaurant, but if that is what they are going for they are missing terribly.  Nevertheless, I feel as though half a stick of butter is overkill for a modest-sized waffle and a side of cornbread.  \n\nThe mason jar of iced tea was also good.  I would expect nothing less from a southern-food restaurant to have good iced tea.  As it turned out, I needed plenty to drink so that I could cut through all the greasy-goodness of the chicken, syrupy-waffle, and buttery-cornbread.",247,2

Used to be 4 stars now it went down over time. Sushi options are limited in this area. They used to do this beautiful fancy presentation of each sushi dish. It was unique and fun to look at the design. I always felt they were on the pricier side though. \n\nThe last couple times I went here that presentation no longer exists.

"I really wanted to love this place! I will say, the food is very good. The problem we had was with the service. It seems we were instantly profiled, as the hostess sat us at the worst possible table, in a mostly empty restaurant. Our table was right next to the dish station and we could hardly hear eachother over the constant clang of dishes. We asked our waitress to be moved to a less noisy table. She seemed really irritated and moved us to the table nearest the door, with the cold night breeze coming through the doors right at us. With the table change came a new server, she was really nice. We just couldn't get over their blatant desire to sit us at the absolute worst tables when every other table was open. We spent too much money and tipped too well to have been treated like that. We probably should've just left and spent our money elsewhere.",182,1

Parking is easy and right next to the pool so you don't have to shlep your crew and your gear through a huge casino.\n\nThe bad: All good pool clubs will cost you some money once you get in, but this one is off the charts. Every last thing costs an inflated amount of money. If you come in the day time without renting a cabana or bed, find a little concrete to sit on the towel (that you had to rent) if you're not going to dance. Water is $10. Drinks are $11 and up (way up). Some of the other Yelpers here have accurately laid out how much things cost, which explains why most every daybed and cabana stayed empty. I'm not averse to spending some cash if I get a great experience in return, but sadly there is nothing to set it apart from most any other pool club on the Strip. The location is also a little odd; unless you want to go over to Mandalay, there is no place you can easily walk to when you're done. Seems dangerous to stick people in their cars right after you fed them (overpriced) drinks and sunshine all day.\n\nThe Ugly: There is more security than I have ever witnessed for ANY music related event. Metro Police, Sheriff's Dept, plain-clothes police, and the venue's own massive security staff outnumbered the patrons at one event, and was about 1 to 1 for the other event. Don't get me wrong, I understand the implications of water, alcohol, and party people (to say nothing of the illicit things people like to sneak in), and I appreciate the efforts of those assigned to keep people safe, but it felt like a Police State where every action was observed. When we were getting ready to go, my girl and I were scolded for putting on our dry jeans because it wasn't \""swim wear\"" and we needed to wait until we left. Really? After the ridiculous money we just dumped in your new venue? As we were leaving? Not exactly a great atmosphere to \""cut loose\"".",465,1
"Meh. I was so excited for the frozen hot chocolate that I was easily let down. \n\nNo takeout until 11AM unless you go to the bar facing he strip. Menu says $11 for a frozen hot chocolate, $10 with reward card but I was charged $13! Ahhh! Why did you charge me a different price? I didn't bother asking because I'm not giving any more business to the place after this experience. \n\nAdditionally, the frozen hot chocolate  isn't even good. Tastes like a bad version of blended Milo. No thanks.",129,0
"Well I have been here twice this past month (due to family members picking the spot) and I can honestly say after two separate visits I'm still not impressed. \n\nThe food is okay, the prices are pretty extravagant for what you get- the only real good part about this place is the live music and atmosphere on a Friday night. \n\nLast time I had the seasonal pumpkin soup which was very herb heavy. I honestly don't remember my entree so I have no opinion one way or another. This visit I got the salmon which was cooked perfectly. The badness was desert when I decided on the Tu-zookie (think Oregano's Pizookie but not nearly as awesome). In their defense the menu says the cookie dough is half-baked but when it came out it was a raw mess. I could not stomach eating it which is sad because there goes $6.99.\n\nFor such a nice looking place you'd think they'd have it all together, but for what you pay I don't think I'll be going back.",228,1
"Obey the snake and go see the naughty Eves at Eden's stripper garden, Mr Adam.  Just a block or two up from the Rio and Palms, so this smaller strip club is one of the closest to the Strip.  The numbers are similar to the rest: $30 cover (out of state), $6 beers, $20 lap dances. \n\nIt's a nice size place, not as big as the warehouse that is Sapphires or as ultra lounge crowded as Spearmint Rhino.\n\nThe apples here are mostly Red Delicious, not so many Granny Smiths.  I've heard tales of a lot of Granny sightings, but I think it depends on what night you go.  Try to go on a Fri or Sat.",161,2
"If I had to present myself as an expert on any subject, reviewing Elton in Caesars is a definite expertise.  Whether you're a veteran fan or a curious newbie, you've come to the right opinion place.  This is the easiest review I'll ever write.\n\nIf you're a curious newbie, in that you enjoy Elton's hits but still haven't managed to see him these last five decades -- GO NOW!  One of these days he might finally say THAT'S THAT and you'd hate yourself for having missed him.  He's 67 and I think even Sir Elton might feel 70 years old is pushing it, right?\n\nSo on the age thing you fear he's too old to rock maybe.  Nope.  Just saw this show and somehow his voice was better than the Red Piano show, his prior extravaganza at Caesars Palace.  And so, please, if you're tempted -- splurge on some solid seats and do this.  You'll be happy you did.\n\nSuppose you're a veteran fan, however.  As in you've seen him once or twice or more before, and/or you've seen the Red Piano and doubt you need to see him YET again.  That's where I was frankly.  I couldn't believe the Red Piano could be topped --\n\n-- and I was right.  Red Piano is a five star event, where Million Dollar Piano is a four star tour date.  Where Red spent a fortune on visuals and sets, Million didn't... despite it's piano bragging rights.  I've heard somewhere that Elton uses computer screensavers as backgrounds... as in... the visuals you sometimes see weren't even created for this show.  If that's true, it shows.  If it isn't, it feels true.  \n\nIf you've seen Million but not Red, remember the fantastic visuals during Philadelphia Freedom?  That's how ALL of Red felt:  big, bombastic, fun.  Million is a little more sedated and serious.  My partner in crime suspects Elton wanted to be more of the center of attention this time, and I can understand that.  Imagine being Elton and you sense half your audience is watching a giant TV behind you.  It would be weird, right?\n\nSo veterans know that the playlist is similar to Red Piano, but with some interesting changes.  I don't want to give them away and so I'll say there's one song that Elton played he typically doesn't like playing.  Not Candle In The Wind, by the by.  I'd never seen it live and it fit... especially so close to the Mirage (wink).  There were also two songs included specifically for the legendary percussionist Ray Cooper.\n\nIf I may be picky here, the longer Ray Cooper bit is a song I've never liked.  It's akin to Mad Men Across The Water... but nowhere near as good.  It was included for thematic reasons, but even so, I'd swap it out for something better.  \n\nThe song that occurred to me (which could sort of be on the same subject) is LIVE LIKE HORSES.  That would be a superior choice because Elton could have done the duet with a visual of Pavoratti.  (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, go drop a visit to YouTube.  It's a stunning unheard single.)  \n\nOne other song that I believe was a misstep was Circle Of Life.  I'm spoiling this because it simply shouldn't be the last song of any Elton John concert.  The lyrics weren't written by Taupin and the tone isn't quite Elton.  It comes off like a cover song somehow and that's fine in the middle of the show but not as the finale.  \n\nElton should have been brave enough to do his new single HOME AGAIN... with that majestic music video playing in the background.  Maybe have it lead into SKYLINE PIGEON and call it a day... and a blessed career.\n\nOne thing you should know:  I've never seen a show where half the floor stands in ovation at the end of every song.  I'm not kidding.  \n\nThat says something.",934,3
"Dined here today and the food and service were both excellent.  We had the Chickenstein pizza and got half chicken and half shrimp as toppings.  The sauce was really good and it was a nice way to \""think out of the box\"" so to speak with pizza.  The only thing missing for this dining experience were TV sets and a better bar selection.  Having a variety of alcohol available and TV sets on would make Wolfman a real go-to place for having food and fun.  The staff members were friendly and gave top-notch service.  Giving them more fun options available with the bar and TV viewing would really help them shine.",134,4
"This exhibit is a mix of sports memorabilia and interactive tests of your athletic skill. However cool you think that sounds, it wasn't as cool as you think. They have jerseys and other sportswear for the greats from each of the big North American sports. For each of those sports, they also have one or two standard athletic tests, like how fast can you throw a baseball and how high you can jump. I think I enjoyed the adjacent Titanic exhibit more, and that's coming from a guy who didn't particularly enjoy the movie.",110,2

"I am so glad that we've found a place not far from home that has cronuts and breakfast!! My boyfriend, sister, and I came here for breakfast one morning and to grab some donuts/cronuts for the family. I was in heaven when I saw a decent variety that were all presented very well. I knew that I was hungry for a big breakfast so I ordered the bagel sandwich with eggs and cheese and it came with a hashbrown and two cinnamon cronut fingers.\n\nMy sister and boyfriend both got a cronut sandwich with ham, cheese, and eggs which also came with a hashbrown and cinnamon cronut fingers. Heaven. We were all in heaven. You can get refills on your fountain drinks but ketchup wasn't out and ready to use, we had to ask for some. No biggie!\n\nThe customer service was fair, it doesn't seem like the person at the front had really worked many customer service jobs before. It's not like he was mean, he just didn't smile much and wasn't super upbeat.\n\nWe ordered a chocolate glazed cronut with bavarian creme filling, an apple pie donut, a lemon filled cronut and a regular glazed cronut to go. They were so delicate and flaky, the lemon filling was AWESOME. We will definitely be coming back and trying the cronut petites which were just cronut bites with fillings.",291,3

"My new favorite Peruvian restaurant. I had the tallarines verdes with the bistek on the side (for my carnivorous husband) because I don't eat meat and they were more than accommodating and did not seem to judge me for doing that (which most places do). The tallarines verdes is the best I've had in Arizona and I will only go to El Chullo to have it. You know how you grab on to your bed sheets because the feeling is so glorious and out of this world? Yes, it's like that! I can't wait to try the other entrees, specifically, the vegetarian options. The alfajores is also delicious; flaky but held it's form and not overwhelmingly sweet - it definitely quieted my sweet tooth. The chicha morada is also quenching - not bitter and too sweet, just right - be sure to order the pitcher because you will drink it like water.\n\nIt's a quaint place to eat. They have lunch specials/combo. The parking situation is a little challenging, but I would like to go there at least once a week to satisfy my Peruvian food cravings. I hope you check out this place because although it's easy to miss (because of location), you'll be sorry if you don't go.",269,4
"Yelp really needs to give people the option to leave NO stars. Absolutely terrible experience at this bank. \n\nOpened a wells fargo account two months ago, one of the questions my fiance and I asked was about their over draft protection. We were explicitly told by the banker who helped us (her name is Eva Meneses) that if for any reason our rent was due and the money was not yet in our account, that wells fargo would cover us, charge us a $35 fee and that would be that. We found out recently that not only was overdraft protection activated on our account, the type of account we have would not even allow us to have over draft protection. We called the 24/7 number to see what was happening originally because it was past the business hours of our local branch and they again told us that our overdraft protection was there. When we confronted the branch manager (Bronson Manivong) where we opened the account he then told us that our account would not qualify for overdraft protection. I called the number back again to put in a complaint with them about how we have been lied to by the customer service number and the branch and they then told me that even if we would qualify for overdraft protection it is at Wells Fargo's discretion if they cover the charge or reject it. I have never been ran around in more circles, or lied to so much by a company in my life. After two months my fiance and I are officially going to close our accounts and find a bank somewhere else to handle our money because neither of us wants our hard earned money in the hands of people who have done nothing but lie to us from the moment we opened our account.",351,0
"One of the legit \""great food\"" spots in Montreal. Yes you'll likely wait in line and yes it's well worth it. Service is very good and friendly, prices are reasonable and the food tastes great. The atmosphere is also really nice - I believe the small size of the place adds to it and makes it more special. \n\nIt's also great to see a Japanese restaurant without the standard sushi fare we see at 99% of the other places! This is real Japanese food, and it's really well done. \n\nFor the vegetarians out there: try the Okonomiyaki pancake (ask them to remove the fish flakes that goes on top) and also the veggie hot pot... both are excellent.",155,3
"We ate their twice and both times had serious red flags and worse.

They add chemicals and heap on unhealthy ingredients to improve the richness and taste of their food- and we are in the position to know!!

When my husband approached the door to make sure they were still open, the girl looked at her partner and quite obviously rolled her eyes as my husband entered. We asked if they were still open, since they did not appear to be, and she responded that they were open until 9:30pm. \nNeedless to say, we opted not to have dinner there and are extremely disappointed with this Rubios experience.",147,0

"Ever since McDonald's took its Angus Deluxe off the menu, Jack In The Box's Sirloin Burger has been a go to favorite. \n\nLook, I know I'm not a foodie... I'll never be the guy with a sophisticated Midwestern palate, who orders half the menu, takes 60 pics, and writes a huge run on sentence with no capitalization or punctuation in order to advertise his blog....where he basically pretty much just loves anything trendy, popular and pricey... I'll never be the guy who carries around a professional looking camera and only eats burgers with radioactive Chinese farm raised truffles and chicken pate passed off as foie gras... And I'll certainly never be the horny guy who uses Yelp reviews to attract chicks looking for a free meal...in hope that maybe, just maybe they like him...or at least use him for free meals on a continual basis.\n\nI'll be the guy who goes to Jack In The Box and gets a sirloin burger sans sauce....with a side of onion rings. At $7 or so for the combo, I'd say it's a good deal... and taste wise, I prefer it to much more expensive burgers I've had. The bun is good, the pickle....lettuce...tomato are good quality, and the meat consists of an actual cut. It's never greasy...and never results in a bout of diarrhea like competing fast food burgers do.",299,2

"I hate to give this place a bad review, because the first time I went, it was delicious! The guacamole is great and the service is friendly. However, the last time I went it was so terrible that I don't think I'll be going back again. The server informed me that it was $1 tacos, so obviously that's a deal, but they were so bad that I couldn't even eat them. I got three different kinds, all of which tasted like burnt, old meat, topped with slimy cilantro and onion-- no tomato, lettuce, cheese, or sour cream-- which was confusing to me, since my friend had ordered hard tacos and had gotten the listed toppings. Her hard shells tasted stale! I filled up on tons of guacamole and chips and salsa, but I feel like their food quality has gone down since opening.",175,1
"Moe's = meh. The food was fine, but overpriced. I ordered the Cobb salad for $8.75 and it was drowning in dressing and had four thin slices of avocado and four under-ripe tomato wedges on a mound of lettuce. Ian's across the street is serving salads of comparable size and better ingredients for $5 with chicken. My friend's Southwestern Chicken salad looked better, but rang in at $10. Again, the food was fine, but overpriced for a place billing itself as a tavern  that seems to be based on a Simpsons reference (further compounding my theory is their hideous logo comprising terrible font & frosty cartoon beers). \n\nWhile the overall experience was underwhelming, I have to say our server was good - attentive, friendly, and kind enough to point out things like Moe's idea of fresh vegetables is carrots & celery. \n\nI won't complain if i end up at Moe's again, but I'm not going to suggest we go either - you can find a lot more bang for your buck within a block or two.",226,1
"My boyfriend and I went here on Friday to celebrate our anniversary and a late birthday dinner for me. The bread sticks appetizer with the red pepper hummus was delicious. We decided to do the prix fixe menu. I got the tomato soup, lamb and carrot cake bread pudding for dessert. The soup was pretty good, the lamb was very tasty especially considering it was my first time having it. The pesto sauce really enhanced the flavor. The carrot cake pudding was very flavorful but the rum ice cream was too much for me. \n\nFor the most part, it was a very satisfactory meal. The only reason I rate this low is because I felt like we were neglected as customers by the chef and his wife. They made an effort to make the rounds to most of the tables but our only interaction with the chef was when he brought our appetizers out and he didn't even ask our names or how we were doing but I saw him chatting up other tables. Maybe it's because we look young and were by far the youngest in the restaurant by about 25 years?",218,2
"If someone else is buying, I'd go back here happily. The detractors were fairly few, but I'll call them out right here.  1, the wine list, though fairly extensive, had unreasonable pricing on the lower end bottles.  I understand the mark-up system, but there should be a more reasonable option for those who need it.  2, the cheese plate was not good.  It was not balanced, and just needed a little fixer to be right.\n\nThe bad news out of the way, it was a tasty place to dine when you're craving red meat.  I had the bone marrow flan appetizer, which was rich, buttery and flavorful.  The presentation was also very nice.  My main was the Indian spiced short ribs. I had a major mental disconnect on this. Beef and Indian spices?  Seriously, isn't Shiva going to rain fire down for this?  Well, if she does, it would be a pity, as the flavors were wonderful. The texture was perfect.  I also tried the lamb chops which were juicy, flavorful, etc.  Another person at my table had the new york, and it was also excellent. It had a good char, deep flavor, and was properly cooked. The other people at the table I was at actually requested to have their meat fired again, as their definition of steakhouse medium was actually a proper steakhouse medium well, but I wouldn't fault the restaurant for their preference for meat, which in my opinion is over cooked.  The restaurant was very accomodating to their needs, and provided excellent service.",333,3
"Indulge is clearly trying. They have great service and decent ambiance. But damned if those burgers aren't mediocre.\n\nConsidering that the only places that open in the Valley anymore are gourmet burger joints or wood-fired pizza kitchens, you've gotta do something to stand out. Indulge's attempt is the Vesuvius Volcanic, a grand name for some melted cheese inside a beef patty. Based on the description and safety warnings, I thought I'd get blasted with molten cheese when i cut into the thing, but it just oozed out. And yes, I realize that could be mistake for euphemism.\n\nI ended up eating it with a fork, which was not all that fun.\n\n(Note to every burger/wood-fired pizza joint in the region: Shocktop and Landshark are NOT microbrews, no matter what Peter King says.)",184,1

"This place is only open on the weekends, cash only, almost hidden in a strip mall (the only sign out front is a large Puerto Rican flag in the window) but it is one of the best finds in the Phoenix area.  It's the only place I've ever had Puerto Rican food but I think I've been spoiled because it is unbelievably delicious and very very inexpensive.  I have it on good authority that this place is authentically cooked homestyle Puerto Rican food and pastry.  They have mofongo, pernil, arroz con gandules, and different sandwiches like cubano and tripleta.  Mango y queso pastries to finish it off.  Menu changes a bit each week so it's great for return visits.  I can't get enough.",160,4

"I feel the need to review this restaurant to offset the low score by the only other reviewer.\n\nI've been here a few times, and I've always had great service. One of those times, I sat at the bar with my boyfriend, and the sushi chef chatted with us. He was really chill & polite, so I'm surprised by Bret's comment -- perhaps it was a different chef?\n\nThe food is good, and I like their menu a lot. They have a variety of ingredients in their rolls beyond the standard California roll-type options. One of my favorites is the salmon & mango roll. It always tastes really fresh and tangy delicious.\n\nEvery time I've been there, I've been offered dessert on the house. I usually turn it down, as I'm too full of sushi, but one time I accepted and was presented with a cute little dish of green tea ice cream. It was better than green tea ice cream that I've had elsewhere. They have mochi too, I believe (yay!).\n\nI also really appreciate the fact that they don't blare hip hop music (as is typical of some sushi bars, especially in the Tempe area).\n\nOverall, I have no complaints! This sushi restaurant is totally worth giving a try.",279,4

"Man, I feel bad that I didn't really enjoy this place that much. It kinda makes me feel like a contrarian but it's my honest opinion.\n\nThis new buffet is supposed to rival all the other high-end buffets in town such as Bellagio, Wynn, and the M. Although it is definitely not your average buffet, I don't think it's as good as any of the above mentioned ones on their worst days. This buffet didn't have that \""wow\"" factor I was expecting, especially after having that when I first ate at each of those previously mentioned.\n\nIt was not all bad but I would like to point the things that determined my 3.5 rating:\n\nKing crab legs were still frozen. Not sure if some of the pieces had been sitting on the ice for too long or if they came out that way. Stone crab legs were dry and bland. Oysters were not that fresh even though I observed some guys shucking them behind the line :-/ Some of the labels were missing and or wrong for the food items and that's just a pet peeve of mine. Sushi and Chinese stations had your usual suspects, nothing that really stood out.\n\nOkay enough of the bad, let's talk about the good/must haves:\n\nCheddar broccoli in the American section was the best type of broccoli I have ever had. It was kinda crunchy from being baked, with gooey, greasy cheddar cheese melted on them. Wow. Italian meatballs were perfectly flavored. Sop up the extra marinara with a garlic knot. Prime rib was good, had the nice peppered crust on the outside that I just love. Lamb chops were good, no mint jelly needed. Not gamey at all. Mexican station had this awesome grilled pineapple and jicama salad. Chinese station had a peppered beef with asparagus and dim sum that were pretty good. There was a pho/ramen station that I didn't get to try but I thought it was cool that they offered that. Nutella crepe made to order was yummy and the buttered caramel gelato has to be my new favorite flavor. So rich and buttery, you need to have a drink handy. That sweetness will sit in the back of your throat and tickle if you don't wash it down.\n\nOkay, so that was my review. I think everybody should still go check this place out and I hope you all have a wonderful experience if you do. I think I was expecting too much because of my past experiences. Not to mention all the hype about this.",537,2

Checked in our room and it's cool - much more modern than the old tower for sure. Nice. Unfortunately safe was broken when we tried to use it, but it's ok, per front desk, housekeeping and security - maintenance will fix it. Thirty to forty five minutes later? Nada. Okaaaay. Patience.

It was very small intimate setting, but when the band came out, it got super loud, just like a normal night club, but playing 30's and 40's type of music.  It was a blast, plus it helped having super hot women dancing burlesque along with the music.  I wish this guy Ivan Kane can produce something similar to this in the near future.  I did just hear Holly Madison will be opening up a new spot called 1923, so hopefully that will be awesome/similar!",140,4

"It seems like I've always had bad luck with Dior. \n\n\n\nI ordered a pink new lock pouch from NY boutique , the bag arrived with a minor damage so I returned back to the boutique with no problem.\n\n\n\nI then ordered the exact same bag from Las Vegas boutique on May 9th , the bag arrived on May 15th . The bag did not came with a box , only a dust bag .

She told me she would talk with a manager and call me back, and guess what ? She disappeared too!\n\n\n\nI called the las vegas boutique this morning and luckily the manager answered the phone, I thought finally someone I could talk to.

"We booked a deal through Groupon.  The process was very easy, the staff treated us well, no big complaints. \n\nThe room was alright.  Our bed was extremely comfortable and we had a great view (with an opening patio door).  We enjoyed our time by the pool and the time we spent at the resort.  They even have a shuttle running every 20 minutes to the strip until 8:00 p.m. which was super convenient for us. \n\nI gave Palms Place three stars because it's not a four or five star hotel.  The furniture in the rooms was definitely Ikea-grade, there was some chipped pressboard and loose caulk around our tub.  It was very clean, but not well maintained.  Also the buffet that came with our deal wasn't anything great.  It was better than having to go to McDonalds but only slightly. \n\nWe would stay here again if we got a great deal, but I think next time we'll try to stay on the strip.",222,2

The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because the staff was friendly and attentive, the desserts were decent, and they had a good variety of drinks. \n\nBut the food! The food selection for lunch was sparse and what was available was not appetizing. The food seemed like it had been sitting out for a few hours at least.

We only stopped in here cuz it wasn't crowded on a sat night (first clue to stay away), it was hot as hell outside and this place was air conditioned.

"This review is based on my kid's enjoyment of the place, and on the atmosphere. My 5 and 8 yr old boys had a blast, played for three hours non-stop and wanted more. They could've stayed in there all week. I'm not much of an arcade fan, but I can see the place's appeal- it had a bunch of motion games, like the ones where you move like you're actually in the cockpit of a plane, or inside a racecar. The timeplay cards made it convenient for me, since I didn't have to keep giving them quarters every 15 minutes, like at Circus Circus. It is kind of pricey, but when you consider the quality of the games, I guess they can justify the premium. And most importantly, my boys had a blast.",172,3

"Erm...No thank you.\n\nI appreciated that sizable dancefloor, the two large bars, the coatcheck, and the 80's/retro (Spice Girls, really?) music.\n\nI did not appreciate the scary looking bouncers murdering people bringing drinks onto the dance floor (well not really murder, but nearly!)...there were no signs.

"You get what you pay for here in Las Vegas! If you want high end and go stay at the Wynn or Venetian. That said the Excalibur is just a slightly bit better than Luxor which, when they first opened, was an incredible hotel.\n\nMy last stay at Luxor was a couple of years ago was interesting because when I went into the room there was a body sized, maroon stain on the carpet. I went to the front desk to ask them if I  could please have a room that was not a murder scene. They said no and I left and went to Caesars.\n\nEverybody who comes to Vegas should band together and protest the \""resort fee\"" bullshit.

"I've been to this specific Bevmo twice. I'm torn on whether I like it or not. The first time I came to buy Fulton's Pumpkin Pie Liquor for the holidays. I heard that Bevmo carried it and was excited to find it in the store. However, compared to Total Wine & More, this store seems smaller and harder to find items. (I had to ask the clerk where the item was and even he didn't know! My husband had to find the special pumpkin pie liquor.) Bevmo also seems to carry fewer products, but more of the high-end/strange product.\n\nThe second time I came here I needed to buy 50 mini tequila bottles for a gift bag idea. I really wanted to buy something on the cheaper side (since I needed 50!) but they only had Jose Cuervo at $2.99 a bottle. Also, they only had 24 of them. They did offer to special order me a case, but I declined. I headed over to Total Wine & More and was able to find what I needed (for $0.99!).  Overall, the clerks are nice and helpful (if you ask) but it could be hit or miss with the product.

"First off. Ballys as a place to stay is decent. its centralized position on the north strip makes it ideal and bang for the buck. I've stayed in both the south and north towers. The south towers is more old fashion but if youre staying at this place, I hope decor isnt your number 1 priority. The north tower is more updated and pretty roomy. We got a room with two queens, it came with a 1 person sofa as well as a desk chair with a table. Heres what I hate about Ballys: On august 14th at 6am before I was going to go back to my room, my friends and I were going to chip in money and play one hand in roulette. Lose or win we were going to sleep afterward. Personally I have a habit of each time before leaving vegas, I play one last hand at roulette at which ever casino I'm at..I would just put cash on which ever color I was feeling and its never been a problem. Anyways, what I did was I waited for the dealer to drop the ball and then I put $200 on top of black and just stared at it the entire time. When the ball stopped, it stopped on black and my friends high fived each other. Then when I looked back at the table, the dealer took his hand and hit my money off the black and was like \""cash dont play.\"" I was like, what do you mean? He looked at me with a rude ass tone of voice and was like...\""I said cash dont play!\"". I was pretty mad. I asked him, why didnt you tell me when I put my money down, why did you wait for the ball to fall on black and have that end before you said anything. He told me that he did hit my money out and he did say something but thats complete BS. Even everyone at the table was in awe by it. I called the pit boss over and he basically tol me the same thing but thats complete BULLSHIT! This is the first time anyone has ever said that to me and even if it was true, he had all the time in the world to exchange the cash that I put down for chips. I hate to think that if it did fall on red, that the dealer would have taken my money. So....lesson learned.",479,1

Sometimes, I'll try their pasta because I'm very picky with buffet pastas and it wasn't bad. I loved their small selection of dim sum and it sure was yummy! I was all over that section. They also had an Asian selection of noodle soup, from pho, to udon even wonton just minus the wontons? And you could also add your selection of meatballs for pho, or beef and even fish to your noodles. They also had sushi, I wasn't a fan of it, but they had maki sushi so I took out the salmon and dipped it in wasabi and soy sauce and had small dices of sashimi myself, that was my highlight of the night!

"hmmm, never knew that TGIF's was less expensive than Applebees as the quality of food is much nicer at TGIF's. yesterday me and my girls went to happy hour at Applebees in hopes of finding some good inexpensive appetizers to go with some tasty cocktails. our visit was on to a great start, as our server took care of us like we were in a 5 star restaurant. he was so awesome; he should have been in a tux and bow tie. \n\nthe cost for our drinks and food totaled $41.00 for 3 apps and 7 drinks which isn't bad for happy hour, but a few weeks ago we went to TGIF's for happy hour and ended up with 4 apps, and 2 rounds of specialty cocktails for 3 of us and the bill was under $30. all the appetizers were served at half mass, or at least half the portion served by TGIF's. the potato skins were so greasy not even the sour cream could make it go down smoothly. i did enjoy the spinach and artichoke dip, but the greasy chips were a little too much. kinda funny that the buffalo wings weren't greasy at all. my fav's were the spinach dip and the wings. the spinach dip was served in a kettle pan and there were big chunks of artichoke in it. the chips tasted freshly made but were a little greasy for my liking.  i'll give them another try, but next time it's only wings for me!",317,1
Good selection of snacks.  Convenient gas stop right next to my better half's work.,20,2
"First and foremost, this place is so adorable. Super New York vibe. If you call 24 hours ahead they will make you a gluten free crust. This I found very interesting. Because the dough is made from scratch and it has to rise over night, can we say FRESH! so awesome. Since we didnt call ahead we decided to just stick with a salad. I had the Insalata Grande. Only 8 dollars it consisted of Mixed Greens, Fresh Tomatoes, Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Mushrooms, Olives, Pine Nuts, Cracked Pepper, Shaved Parmigiano, and tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. I also had an espresso martini. WOW i could drink 10 of them. and made with illy coffee? yes please! Ill def be returning here, and next time ill call ahead for a gluten free pizza :)",169,3
"The only good thing about brunch today were the cheese curds. Our waiter was arrogant and didn't listen. We asked him 3 times for a glass of milk and asked him to hold the chocolate sauce on chocolate chip pancakes. He held the chocolate chips. He was so slow too. Not a pleasant person. The pancakes were over cooked. McDonalds does better. The place was not busy and I can see why. Unless they overhaul their service, I'm done going there (and learn how to cook a pancake).",107,1
I stopped in to check this place out. I needed shirts and hats. After talking with them I decided to let them design my logo. They did a great job and I got to see in person instead of ordering something off the web. \n I will continue to use Caveman in the future.,62,4
"Caveat: my parents were in the restaurant business in Los Angeles when I was a kid. In the Indian food restaurant business. I know my Indian food. I know what's good, what's not so good. Years ago (like 5), I went to Origin India and was blown away by the food. It set the bar for Indian food in Las Vegas. \n\nI took my daughters (7 years old) to Origin India a few weeks ago. Figured it's time they're exposed to their peoples' food. The place still looks the same (which is quite nice, actually). The gentleman who waited on us was very friendly. He even brought my daughters out free Mango Lassi's. The lassi's were delicious. Reminded me exactly of those served in my parents' place in LA (now long gone). \n\nFor the kiddos, I ordered plain Naan, tandoori chicken and plain rice. For myself, the vegetable biryani and lamb vindaloo (my favorite dish in the world when done right). And a Kingfisher, which if you haven't tried it, it's a fantastic beer!\n\nOverall, I was pretty underwhelmed by the food. \n\nThe naan seemed flatter than it should be but tasted good. The tandoori chicken was a little on the dry side. Not unlike that you'd find at an Indian food buffet. \n\nThe vegetable biryani was a complete disappointment: mushy rice, too wet, soft and flavorless (probably canned) vegetables. \n\nThe lamb vindaloo was not good. It kind of tasted like vindaloo but mostly didn't. It's hard to explain but the flavors just didn't seem developed enough. You could tell there were spices and flavors in there but they just weren't coming through. The funny thing is, when I took the leftovers out of the fridge to eat the next day, the sauce tasted a 100 times better. I'm guessing the vindaloo sauce wasn't allowed to mix and marry for some time like it needs before being served. \n\nDespite really friendly service, we won't be back.",464,1
"Overall decent.  Don't eat pork, but usually get the chicken salad or turkey plate.  Good..kids like the pork.",29,2
"I've definitely experienced better.  I was quite excited to try SnowFlake when I saw their high rating even though there were only 20 something reviews.  Although shaved snow is still the \""new/cool\"" thing in Vegas, it has been around for years in Cali.   So in comparison, SnowFlake is ranked on the lower end for me.  It didn't taste bad but overall, I was not impressed.\nFirst off, it was overpriced.  ($8 for one flavor of shaved snow, 2 toppings and condensed milk).  They charge for each topping.  We received 1 tablespoon of strawberries and 1 tablespoon of mangos.  Presentation looked nothing like what I've seen in pictures posted.  It looked like a mess, not even picture worthy and I ALWAYS take pictures.\nSecond off, they look disorganized.  There was plenty of space behind the counter but it looked messy.  There was syrups and toppings everywhere on the counter.  There were 2 employees that weren't communicating.  They didn't know who made what or who ordered what.  They handed us our cups and it was sticky with syrup.\nThird, there is no seating area.  There's 3 tables.  One was occupied by someone studying with their laptop.  One with a family and another with a couple.  No area outside to sit.   We had to go to another plaza on spring mt. to enjoy our shaved snow that has already started melting.\nI've looked at the previous reviews by other yelpers.  I did not have the same experience.  It was messy, d\u00e9cor was simple and presentation was definitely not consistent with pictures posted.  I look forward to Fluff Ice or Class 302 coming into town, if they ever do.....",384,1
"By far one of the best meals I have ever had, in Pittsburgh or otherwise.  My dining companions and I had the 6 course meal, which was definitely worth the money.  Our six courses consisted of:\n1. Hamachi sashimi\n2. Diver scallops\n3. Rabbit stew\n4. Sea Bass\n5. Quail\n6. Banana creme brulee\n\nEverything was absolutely fantastic, from the service to the ambiance to the food itself.  The sommelier made a great wine selection, which was tricky, given the variety of food we were having.  All in all, absolutely excellent.  I plan on coming back here a lot more (when it's not on my tab).  Spendy!  But well worth it.",164,4
"This place happens to be right around the corner from my house, so I went for the first time last week. I'll probably be back to give it one more chance because my first experience wasn't anything great. Went on a Friday night just after 6pm, wasn't too busy. Service was pretty fast, and friendly. We ordered two rolls and some fresh sushi, the fresh sushi was pretty good, nothing great, but the rolls were not that great. 75% of the rolls were just rice. They skimped on the toppings and the fillings for sure.",121,2
"Met one of my dear friends here today for lunch...YAY for lunch specials!\nI'm a huge fan of their salad & breadsticks, so I was happy to see the \""salad, breadsticks & soup\"" for $6.99. I wasn't truly inspired by the soup offerings (I loved their Italian wedding soup they used to have), I went with the Pasta e Fagioli. We didn't wait long for the salad; however, it took a bit of time to receive our breadsticks & our entrees (my soup & her pasta entree). The soup was extremely hot, but very hearty & had just enough spicy kick. The breadsticks were so yummy & soft. The salad was just \""ok\"", just didn't seem as tasty as I remember; very light on the dressing. \n\nOur waitress was nice & she wasn't overbearing. The restaurant was clean.\n\nPlenty of parking & easy off & on 85.",205,2

The atmosphere was very nice, spacious, and gave off a warm feeling. The food was very good! The coffee, however, not the best. \n\nThe service was attentive and we never felt neglected for one second. \n\nI don't think they offer valet parking (like many of the other Piedmont Row restaurants), but the garage is right next to Terrace.\n\nAll in all, great place and I will be back...just not for coffee.",157,3

"Krung Siam used to be my go to place for Thai food: however, the last three times I have been to this place has been nothing but disappointing!  What happened, I'm not sure but it feels like they change chef or something.   I went there for lunch on MDW ordered Pat Se-ew, my favorite dish and they informed us there is no chow- phun noodles.  WTH, really its 11:45am and you ran out of the noodles for your most popular dish?  So then I proceed to order a beef salad, and it was the saltiest dish they could have made!. Everything was drench in salt, even my tomatoes were salty!  My friend ordered pineapple fried rice and it was wet and clumpy.   My  boyfriend ordered  a bowl of tomyum soup, and that was the only dish that tasted great. Maybe they have a different chef that works during lunch hour and one at night.  When I came to Krung Siam in the past, it had always been at night, where the food tasted out of this world and the live music created such a nice ambiance.",235,1
"I am shocked this place can false advertise like they do. On the door, they have a giant sign that says \""50% off for all active duty military, police, and firefighters\"" however, they do not hold to this.

"WORSE GENERAL TSO CHICKEN AND CRAB RAGOONS EVER!!!!\n\nNot being a Madison native, I was relying on yelp to find a good Chinese fast food to pick up.  With 4 1/2 stars, I figured this was a safe bet, but for the first time ever, I was blindsided by other yelp reviewers.  \n\nThinking that general tso chicken and crab ragoons were the safe choices for ANY chinese take out, I was wrong. \n\nThe general tso chicken was SO salty I couldn't even swallow it.  I honestly didn't taste ANY general tso, tangy flavoring... it was pure SALT.  The crab ragoons had less than a teaspoon of filling in it and were cooked so crisp, I couldn't even break it. For ~4$, I expected a little more than that. \n\n Don't get me wrong... I understand this is a chinese take out and I dont expect 5 star quality food, but it was so bad I had to return it and went to ANOTHER chinese restaurant for food. \n\nI honestly would have given this a 0 star but they were willing to give me back a refund, which entitled it a 1 star.  The funny thing is when I called back to complain about how salty the food was, she told me that I should have told her not to put as much salt in my food.  Explaining to her how I've never been at the take out, I didn't know I had to specify \""not so much salt\"" when ordering a tangy dish... and she continued to argue with me saying that all of her customers like it that way...and those who dont, they know better and would order \""not so much salt\"" next time they come back,, so next time, I should order correctly.  \n\nNo thanks, I won't be coming back. \n\nSo save your money...save your time...",425,0

"We've been looking for this place a few times in the last 3-4 months.  Finally found it on a Thurs eve after a movie.\nNice wine selection and those prices were ok. (Full bar)\nI ordered the seared tuna and it was very tasty, tho I didn't understand the wasabi on the side.  If you're going to offer wasabi, bring soy sauce as well.\nMy wife wanted the seafood linguini but NOT the spicy sauce.  Later, with some prodding, the waitress let us know they can make it non-spicy.  And the menu states they can change any ingredients, since all their sauces are made to order - we just hadn't seen that note.\nI ordered the Penne Rustica, which was spicy, but not listed as such on the menu.\nInterim review....good, but previous reviewers have said it...Eureka needs to open the spice drawer.  Other than heavy garlic and lots of kalamata (seeded) olives flavor............\nCons - Need spices for flavor - not hot spice, just flavor spice.  Need seafood beyond steelhead trout (which doesn't have much flavor to start with)...how about a nice sea bass?  Chop the olives...too heavy when I'm biting into a whole one.\nPros - great service, fair prices and absolutely willing to delete ingredients you can't handle.  Fresh sauces, cooked to your order.  And LOCALLY owned!\nStars....here's where I really wish we had 1/2 stars.  I'm going to give it a three, but it could be a whole lot better and I'd really like to give it a four next trip.",360,2
"Had the same problem as a lot of people here with the server being rude, comically rude. The sushi was average\n\nCame in with a buddy at 10:20pm; forty minutes before closing and the hostess/server says \""oh my god\"" in what seemed to be a reaction to our arriving so close(forty minutes) to closing. I asked her about something on the menu and she responds by stating we can only place orders until 10:50, never answering my question. We finish at 10:55 and ask for separate checks and she strongly urges us to pay with cash instead of credit. We tell her we don't have cash. She then urges us to pay with a single card until I adamantly refuse. Please fire this bitch",165,0
"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away.

"So it's my sisters bachelorette....I'm the maid of honor. My job is to organize activities/dinners for 28 women. YIKES, and PANIC!!! Luckily, Kori Zornes (Catering Sales Manager) for El Segundo came to the rescue. I contacted her a couple months ago and she was a major help in making the dinner portion of our weekend go smoothly. Kori responded to all of my emails/calls very quickly. Initially we were going to do a \""set\"" menu and then switched to a la carte. Kori was very accommodating in making this change. \nWhen we arrived on Saturday we had the \""Ventana\"" room reserved. This was awesome, as we had the entire room to ourselves. The glass walls allowed for a perfect view of the strip. The wait staff was awesome as well. Quick to take drink and food orders. I had the tortilla soup which was delicious. Even had a little flair, as the waiter placed a bowl of the \""dry\"" ingredients in front of me. Then poured the soup from a separate pitcher into the bowl. Most of the girls ordered tacos, and everyone was pleased with their meal. I was pretty stoked that they sold tall cans of beer, so that's what I had for drinks. Others in our party ordered margaritas and said they were good and strong. Which is great....because we knew when we got to the clubs drinks would double (if not triple) in price. \nThe staff was also spot on in separating the checks. We pretty much broke into small groups rather than have one big check. With as many people as we had in our party, all checks came out correctly. \nI really appreciate the staff and Kori for helping us have a great time. I definitely recommend coming here with any size group!! \n\nTHANKS AGAIN KORI FOR ALL YOUR HELP!! WE HAD A GREAT TIME...I PLAN ON COMING BACK WHEN IN VEGAS!!",403,3

"After a work happy hour a few doors away, several of us were looking for a place to eat, and were having a hard time deciding. I was the pain in the tukkhas, since I'd driven my antique car, and kind of needed to be able to park it where I could see it, plus, I'd really planned the evening to be a birthday dinner for one of the co-workers. We decided to split up, and me and the birthday girl go somewhere, and the rest would hit something within walking distance. Then as Birthday girl and I got to my car, we realized we were parked in front of a restaurant, and Mahoney's won out by default.\n\nWe should have gotten in the car and driven somewhere else.\n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant enough, but the food...yeesh.\n\nEveryone placed their orders, mostly sandwiches of one variety of another, sided with fries, plain or sweet potato, or slaw. I ordered the Reuben hoping for the best, but definitely not receiving it.\n\nMichael's chicken breast with plain fries arrived with sweet potato fries, and instead of just bringing him a side of regular fries, they took the whole plate back to make the switch. Kim's turkey Rachel arrived, and as it was handed in her direction, half of the stuffing fell off the plate and onto the floor. The server took the plate back to the kitchen so that Rachel could be re-stuffed, and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor. Kim #2 had a fried fish sandwich, which looked a little withered, and then there was my Reuben. More like an Ewwwwww-ben.\n\nThe bread was dry as chalk, and the corned beef had been so overdone, it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread. Dry, dry, dry...and I took maybe two bites of the slaw, and that was quite enough.\n\nThe prices aren't steep, but seriously people, take some pride in what you're handing off to a customer. Would YOU eat that?? Seriously, put that order down on the counter in front of you...and take one minute to LOOK at it...then make one exactly like it for yourself. Are you gonna eat that? If not, um, why would we want to pay for it?\n\nThe service was pleasant enough, and the atmosphere was comfortable enough for nice conversation. But would I go back? Nope. The food, my reason for going to a restaurant, was dreck.\n\nMy apologies to my co-workers for forcing them to try it along with me.",552,0
Love this place. The decor needs an update but the staff is super sweet and prompt. Crab puffs are always out quick but when we are in the mood for pot stickers there is a wait as they make them fresh.  Very worth the wait. Kung Pao Beef is my fav!  Enjoy!,61,4
"Just had dinner at Pomo,  the food was great and the service was excellent. My server was Gina. Gina was very helpful in making my choices and explaining the choices in the menu, very friendly and service with a smile. I would recommend this place for great food and great service.",60,4
"I love Nordstrom, let me start off my saying that.  But the last few times I have been there, going back to the holiday season, the service has left little to be desired.  I worked for about 3 years in retail at this very same mall and I was told when I first started to never judge a book by its cover in Scottsdale because the people you perceive as not having money probably have more money than god.  When I go into a department store I want to be treated nicely, to ask if I need anything but I have received none of that when I come into this store.\n\nThis time I was in the shoe department wanting to buy a pair of shoes.  There were several people around trying on shoes and whatnot.  It seemed like there were a lot of workers there too so I was wondering around looking and never once did anyone ask if I was ok or needed anything.  I found what I wanted, picked up the shoe and stood there for a bit waiting to see if anyone would come and help me.  Nothing!  So I walked to the middle of the floor and stood some more and tried to get someone's attention.  I knew what I wanted, knew the size so it would take any more than someone to run back to get the shoes.  I finally caught someone's attention and asked if he could help me...he looked at me said \""Um, I guess there is no one else around\"" grabbed the shoe from me and said \""what size?\""  I told  him what size I needed and as he walked away he motioned to his other customer that he had to go get my shoe and kind of shrugged.  I sat there for 30 seconds, got up and left.  I felt so annoyed and disrespected as a customer that no matter how much I wanted those shoes I would rather buy online if I have too.  Nordstrom this has been a trend for you.  I often shop at The Rail in your store and the people there are snobby and rude.  If you are selling high end stuff maybe you should start hiring high end people and not people who think they are above anyone because the \""basic\"" customer is your repeat customer who will probably end up spending more money with you over the course of a year than the one time shopper!",479,1

"This is a good steakhouse.  It's mostly what you would expect if you've been to this type of place in other cities.  I do like that they tailor the art to reflect the local history.  The bartenders are excellent.  I especially like Seth.  Unlike Mortons and Ruth Chris the bar is a lot of fun.  The crowd is similiar to the other steak places, but seem to me to be a bit younger.  The steaks are what you'd expect and they are excellent.  However, and this may just be my personal opinion I'd stay away from some of the exotic preparations (like coffee beans) and just stick with a good piece of meat.  I really liked the spinach.  They put just the right amount of nutmeg to give it an interesting taste.  The other sides are about average.  If I had to rank these steak places I mentioned in this review I'd have to say the Capital Grille is the current favorite.  I'd like to find a local place that is on par with these franchises, since I'd much prefer to support local business owners.",236,3
"I liked it.  Especially this location being inside Palms.  I enjoyed my favorite, the Chimichanga stuffed with beef.\n\nGood stuff, good value.  Service maybe 3 Stars but the good strong margaritas make up for it.\n\nWill return again!",60,4
"The resort is pretty enough on the inside and outside, however, they closed the pool from 3:00 on to the rest of the night because a 10 minute monsoon created some \""debris\"" in the pool. There was no debris in the pool! I wonder if this happens every time a monsoon hits during AZ's summer months. Hm. The sofa bed's springs were so bad my kids had to sleep on the floor. The only WIFI available was in the lobby. Only restaurant on site opens at 11 am. So don't forget your own cream and sugar if you want coffee in the morning, because your room is the only place you'll get it. We checked out a day early because we didn't want to sleep there another night risking no pool access and a bad night's sleep for the kids - the front desk didn't even inquire if everything was okay. Again, it's a pretty resort and the rooms are decorated nicely but I guess it's the lack of customer service that has forever turned me away from this place.",224,1

"I was very pleased with my experience with Just-In Time. I used them because of all the Yelp reviews, my first Yelp friend Michael C sold me on this company with his review. I even got the Yelp discount of $10 an hour to make the hourly rate $99, Sweet! I guess there my be some cheaper movers, but sometimes you get what you pay for when hiring the lowest cost movers.\n\nThey moved all the stuff (basically furniture and a few boxes) from my house in Biltmore to Scottsdale in a little less than 6 hours. The three guys that moved me needed every inch of the 26 foot truck, with my grill strapped on the outside of the truck. There was a ding here and there, but that's to be expected, there were no breakage issues. As I had fragile items packed by another mover when I moved from my house out of state last summer. There was a chip in my new hardwood floors in the MBR, but I had the hardwood floor guy fixed that today for gratis.\n\nI liked the fact that I just communicated with Justin over the phone and described the job to him. His movers showed up on time and did a fabulous job.",252,4

"My husband and I read reviews and saw pictures on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Alas, for whatever reason, it seems things have changed at this restaurant.  Banh mi are now $5 each, with the exception of the tofu one which costs more.  I got the grilled pork and pate one, and it was majorly disappointing.  A few skimpy slices of bbq pork, which was kind of spam-like; not a problem by itself, but for $5 and the quantity I kind of expected actual grilled pork slices.  The worst part was the pate, though.  There were seriously like three smears of it.  Basically all I could taste was the pickled vegetables, which were abundant.  My Vietnamese iced coffee was mostly ice and I finished it while we were waiting for the food to be ready.",172,1
"The salesman, Will, was great. He was very easy going and knew plenty about the car we test drove. Unfortunately, his sales manager, Cassidy, was incredibly pushy and refused to give us a price on the car. He kept asking what our budget would allow and when we responded by asking what the best he could was, he wouldn't budge from the sticker price. That is, until we started walking out, then he started yelling after us to come back and we could \""finally talk.\"" It's ashame really. Car buying should not be so frustrating.",118,0
"We stayed here the very last time we went to Vegas.  I like the Aria and City Center, because its brand new and everything is so interesting.\n\nBoyfriend booked this room because it was last minute and wanted to try some place new, so we got a suite.  I guess we were spoiled by the Trump from the last time we stayed here, so things weren't up to our expectations.  The hotel smelled nice and it was really pretty and simple, but the room arrangement was just weird.  \n\nThe very first thing you see when you walk into the room is the mini-bar, sink, and microwave, etc.  It was really small and skinny, and pretty dark.  I like the fact that their shades have a black-out setting and the blinds are automatic by the touch of a button, but when walking in it made the room feel really small.  \n\nThe bedroom was small too, with a small closet and one dresser.  The bed was comfortable and had book lights into the side tables so that was nice. \n\nI loved how their bath products are all Aveda!  The housekeeper even gave us a little extra to take home since we loved the shampoo so much and didn't have time to buy some.  Overall, the bathroom was small but clean.  Its a good place to stay if you're only staying a night (and your time isn't spent in the room).  \n\nThe pool disappointed me though! Their closing time is super early, at 6pm.  We were psyched because our friends came over to try the pool out, and we were only able to stay about 10 minutes because they close so early.  Its nice though, because there are also mini pools you can wade in while drinking or something, as well as a large jacuzzi. \n\nIt was a nice experience, but I don't think I'd stay here again.",412,3
"Food is well made and tasty. Interesting interior and atmosphere. Good Italian soda. Good brunch place, but there are some better places in Madison. \n\nProbably deserves 4 stars if it was not for the following. No fresh juice.  No outdoor seating. A little slow. They don't take any cards.",68,2
"This isn't a bad place. It's nice on the inside, the booths are spacious, but the menu is severely limited. There's a handful of appetizers, a few salads, and the rest is sandwiches and burgers. Nothing on the menu really stands out as being that special. I got the Reuben sandwich and it was fine. The bonus was the eggplant fries, they were pretty good. There's a decent beer selection (mostly in bottles, with some on tap). \n\nWith its apparent shortcomings I plan on going back. This is the kind of place I could see myself hanging out at and having a few beers before moving on to other places for the night.",142,2
"I was excited about this place because I am a huge acai fan. So, I go in (15 min ago) and there are 3 high school kids working there, 2 on laptops and 1 behind the counter. I wasn't greeted when entering and when I ordered the kids got up from their laptops without washing there hands or putting on gloves and made my acai bowl. Had I not paid I would have walked out. I can't tell you if the food was good because I threw it away. Thanks for the wasted $7. I would have prob came in a few times a week.",128,0
Humble pie is a solid 4 star restaurant. Been to several HPs throughout the valley and they are quick and easy choice for a nice pizza meal. Especially when there is a Groupon offered or on their Thursday nite date nite then the prices are very reasonable. Last night we came in to get something to eat before a movie and had a $20 Groupon and ordered the mozzarella cheese bites and the egg pizza which were both excellent. Perfect amount of food to share and the bill was very close to $20. Had great service from Matt as well which made going to Humble very nice. Been to this location 3 times and each time we've had great service and good food. You bet there are better places to go in town for gourmet pizza but if you don't fee like driving far and want something casual then Humble will satisfy your pizza craving.,177,3
Had reservation for 7:00 and got seated 7:45 and only cause we pushed them a bit otherwise looked like another half an hour.. Appetizers were ok ..i really liked the spring rolls.. Sushi was tasteless and rice was undercooked. Service could have been better..,61,2
"Blair will not approve of this review :)\nFor the high-carb lover...*blush* you can trek over to Cugino's.  This is a family-owned Italian grocery and restaurant with pastas, antipasti, homemade pizza, Boars Head meats, deli sandwiches, eggplant parmesan, you name it.\nI have a particular fondness for their bread.  They look like mini loaves of baguette, and they are served warm.  Holy (@$)*% once I ordered three to go and thought I would share them with coworkers but I ate them all walking back to my office!!!  They also have yummy garlic knots!\nToday was a particularly stressful day - I was up til 3AM typing a paper, then got up early for work of course and felt like I deserved something yummy for lunch.  Cugino's has arancini - fried risotto balls stuffed with cheese rolled in seasoned breadcrumbs, served hot with marinara sauce.  WHOA, right?!  I added a mini baguette thingy and wa-la!  Carbilicious!\nThese are super delicious, very different from the truffled ones at Ferraro's (those are more refined of course, and smaller).  I had 2 of these and that was plenty.  yum yum yum they only make a certain amount per day so I better not tell you any more of my noshing secrets :)  Oh yeah and the whole meal cost me under $4.",298,3
"Ok, so we all the know the WYNN is supposed to be exquisite, and although their resort is quite nice, their buffet \""THE BUFFET\"" is maybe just slightly above mediocre.  My husband and I come to Las Vegas about every year for our \""adult\"" get away and like to try many different restaurants.  We hadn't yet eaten anywhere at the WYNN and decided to give their buffet a try.  BIG MISTAKE.  I am not a picky eater, however, I had trouble finding food that tasted good anywhere on the buffet.  The food at their \""Mexican\"" station was gross.  I am not of Mexican heritage and I make better food than that.  Same with the Italian station.  Just not really anything to brag about. \n\nI really wanted to like their food, and for the $50 a plate price I was expecting fabulousity on a plate, however, all I got was disappointment.  I will say, their desserts were good.  Not wonderful, just good.\n\nI would not recommend this buffet.  Go somewhere else.",229,1
"Went to dinner with a friend of mine.\nAtmosphere was nice nothing special, service was adequate.\nFood- I ordered the steak and chicken chili (I know why that) and it was just awful. It was similar to a soup you would buy at frys grocery store where it's dumped out of a big container and heated up.\nFriend had pepperoni & sausage pizza and I had a slice. Decent, wouldn't go back for mediocre quality. Not horrible just par.",100,2

"One star for having Yuengling at the hotel bar, and having a hotel bar that's open late. Yuengling is an east/central PA thing, but I guess Iron City is gone now, so my people in Pottsville can take over the awesome responsibility of providing a local beer.\n\nBut really, what happened during the renovation? The granite counters, the nickel fixtures, the flat screen TV, the *8* nearly-cubic down pillows, and the beige tile all touch on the trends of the mid-aughts, but who did the work?  The otherwise-new sliding bathroom door has a busted latch (complete with wood splinters), the tile seems to have been caulked with a hand-squeezed tube, the faucets wobble in their mounts, and the room (maybe due to early check-in?) was lacking in paper products. I also knew that I could safely stash my laptop in the armoire drawers, because one of those drawers had dusty underwear left by some long-gone patron.  \n\nStill the location is great (love the view), the valet parking is a great deal at $25/day for unlimited ins and outs, and staff is friendly, and the free WiFi signal is strong.\n\nCongratulations D&M on your wedding! However, they don't recommend this place for other folks bringing a big group into town. Too many screw-ups and miscommunications, and too much extra work fixing the mistakes.",307,1
"I finally got to check this place out for my birthday. I'm from New Orleans so I've been craving some good crawfish and peel n eat shrimp. If I rated this just on food I'd give it 4 stars. I ordered a pond of shrimp, crawfish and blue crab with cajun spice at the spicey level. Spicy wasn't too hot, I could have gone to the top level. The shrimp and crawfish were excellent, fresh, a good amount. Crab wasn't the best deal, just two in a pound but I figured that.\n\nWhat could have been better... ambiance is just OK. Maybe a few more booths and a little more space between tables. Needed some baskets for discards so we didn't have to dig through our old stuff in the bags. Service was a bit slow but it was a busy Mother's day Sunday.\n\nI'll go back again just for the shrimp and crawfish and try the extra spicy.",208,2
"Once again, Mardi Gras comes through. I found Mardi Gras several years ago for a Halloween costume. I've rented from them several times for events, photo shoots, and parties. I've purchased a few items and accessories as well. They always have what I am looking for, and most times even more than I was expecting. I've also had really great service with helping me navigate EVERYTHING that they have. Great ideas and suggestions. Always fun to shop there.",97,4
"Came here on my birthday and walked out before I could be seated. The lady at the counter told my family and I that she would be with us in a minute. She then proceeded to go to the kitchen area and talk with a few of her co-workers. Ten minutes went by before my family and I decided on another place to eat. Apparently talking about another co-worker and her \""failure to show up for work\"" and \""pull her own weight\"" was more important than seating my family. All in all, avoid this place. The place is dusty and dirty on the inside and outside. It needs a makeover with respect to the establishment and staff.",135,0
"While visiting, I checked out Yelp for Thai food in the area. Originally, I wanted to go to a different location, but it was closed on a Sunday. We came for an early dinner at 5pm on Sunday. No one was there probably due to Super Bowl. Shortly after we sat, five other families came in. I ordered their house salad and added tofu with their peanut sauce dressing to share with a friend. Yum! I loved their large chunks of fried tofu and their peanut sauce was super tasty.  For dinner, I ordered their #41, my favorite Pad Thai with shrimp but it came out with beef. I was little disappointed it had beef, but I was hungry. I wasn't impressed with the sauce they used it wasn't all that tasty but I was hungry and ate half portion. My friend order a beef pho, she thought it was okay. She thought the broth tasted a little funny so she asked the waiter for some limes. It seemed to help. She wasn't able to finished it all and good it to go. The service was great and friendly. D\u00e9cor was good, a little old fashion. The game was on but no one was interested in it. Prices were good.",257,2
"Like some of the other reviewers my husband and I have had nothing but trouble with the staff at this location. They disappear for 10-15 minute periods and rarely refill your drinks unless you flag them down and ask. Some of them also have a knack for ignoring you once they've given you the check...\n\nThe food here is usually good. We get their Native Style Strippers with BBQ sauce and the cheesy garlic bread, both are yummy. \n\nBeware if you get take-out from here, they have a tendency to screw up your order. One time we got honey BBQ instead of normal. Oftentimes they forget to give you things like ranch/sour cream or give you prepackaged when you asked for house dressing. You really have to check your order before you leave. \n\nEven though the food is good, if there were more in the way of restaurants out here (hopefully there will be soon) we would probably go here maybe a once a month instead of once a week.",212,2

It's all vegetarian / vegan, but every person I know in Vegas who eats meat has said that they love it there and go all the time.  It's popular with veggie lovers and meat-eaters alike!\n\nYou have to try the lotus root cake and the buddha delight for something light.  The vegan cheesecake is amazing as well.  Service is fantastic - they are always so sweet and will happily recommend great dishes for new patrons.  If you are craving Chinese food, go there immediately!  :)",144,4
"Having had memorable meals at Kai, we were thrilled to learn of its former chef joining partnership here at Mod.   Signature touches and flair were apparent in the presentation, the food was innovative and some of it was excellent, such as the \""shroom\"" dish.  The venison lollipops were too rare for me, but my husband said they were tasty.  He also had the pescado loco tar tare, and found it to his liking. I ordered the duck large plate and was disappointed-duck was good, but dish featuring beans, rice, okra, etc. was no better than say one would get at Milagro Grill or The Mission. The okra was unusually salty.  A server came to our table with a covered dish and asked if it were ours.  We inquired as to to what it was. He didn't know. He had come from the kitchen; not a regular waiter, but totally clueless. I do understand it was Labor Day Weekend and staff may have been not the usual crew. Our waitress was very pleasant, the hostess welcoming, and the others we encountered were attentive. Loud music for a younger crowd was intrusive. I could see going again for appetizers and a cocktail, but would not go back for dinner, considering the myriad of choices available here in the Valley.",263,2
"On average, I eat at ten restaurants a week.  In my life, I have never experienced such utter disdain for the wishes of the customer as I witnessed last night.  My overall experience in your restaurant was one star.  It would have been zero stars except for the collective, attentive service we were given by an obviously well trained wait staff.  It's too bad that you can't train away indifference towards the customer.  My problem is with a Houston's philosophy of: it doesn't matter what the customer wants, you are going to have it our way, or no way.\nHere is what happened.  The fish sandwich is fried.  One of us wanted it grilled.  The answer was \""we can't do that\"".  Why not?  You have a grill.  One of us wanted the chicken salad with the dressing on the side.  The answer was \""we can't do that\"".  Why not?  Is the salad pre-prepared with dressing on it?  One of us wanted that salad with salmon instead of chicken.  The answer was \""we can't do that\"".  Why not?  This doesn't even deserve any further discussion.\nThe fact that we will never set foot in your restaurant again will have absolutely no impact on you at all.  It's obvious how little you care about our wishes.  What I hope has an impact, however, is that every single day I will relay my story of the lack of any customer service I received from you.  You see, I'm in the customer relationship business and my goal is to differentiate myself from you in every way.  I will tell this story to every client, prospective client, associate, and friend, as a lesson on how not to do business.  The positive is that the manner in which I treat my customers has been reinforced by your lack of basic business practices.  \nThat's good for me, bad for you.",413,0

"We found this restaurant through CitySearch and noticed the rave reviews. Being a foodie, I decided to check it out the other night. Where I live in Vegas, it's a 9 minute drive on the freeway, so it's close. It's also located in a very nice area of town, which brought my hopes up. Going with a previous review stating that this was better than Nobu--which honestly did not impress me when I went last week--I wanted to see what an off strip Sushi bar could offer.\n\nWalking into the place, you feel like you've steped into a posh Japanese sushi bar. The colors and layout is fantastic, and there are at least four sushi chefs on hand at all times. I loved the menu offerings, from cold and hot appetizers to the infamous hibachi and bento boxes. As any great sushi bar will have, they offer the Americanized rolls but have a beautiful variety of sushi to order. We ordered the Man dai sushi (Japanese snapper) and garlic tuna sushi, along with shrimp & vegetable tempura appetizer, beef teriyaki (cut up ribeye) appetizer, fried gyoza, Nobu special roll, and yellowtail jalapeno sashimi (which they offer at Nobu for three times the price).\n\nI have to say that as a person who grew up on a Pacific Island and having access to authentic Asia cuisine, including breathtaking Japanese sushi chefs and their culinary expertise, this place ranks on my top five places in Las Vegas to go for sushi. Not only were the flavors beautiful and clean, but their service was impeccable, their servers dressed (the women only) in kimonos which added to the authenticity of the restaurant, and the traditional Japanese greetings coming in and leaving. Add on the experience with honest-to-god beautiful and very delictable Japanese cuisines, and you have yourself a fantastic restaurant off the strip that is much better than what the hotels have to offer.\n\nI know some people may think that I am exxagerating, but you have to try it to understand the beauty in their food.",428,3
Ehhh. It was okay. I really don't appreciate when people let their children run loose while other people are trying to enjoy a nice lunch.  The waitress said nothing to the heifers who were swilling beers and tater skins instead of paying attention to their children who were behaving horrible.  Running around and even more rude parents showed up who let their toddler play with the unsupervised brats while they drank! The food was mediocre at best. The cherry on top was the guy who stood 5 feet from the table by the door and lit up a cigarette. No. Stop. Don't.  #keepdriving,128,1
"Where do I start?\n\nI like the bread and how it taste, it also has a good shelf life. After it goes stale I use it to make homemade croutons... very flavorful with my recipe.\n\nOver the years the quality has gone downhill. The loaves have gotten smaller, the price has gone up. They say they have discontinued some styles, but I find them elsewhere (CostCo) and they still sell the 2# loaf.\n\nRecently the owner past away, just about the time they moved locations and were bought out by Swiss Oven Bakery, their 50 person workforce was raided just last week and Mesa Sheriffs Dept arrested 28 illegals working for them. Booo... two thumbs down on that move guys, you should know better. Who's running your HR department?\n\nThe newer facility is nicer, cleaner, bigger and has room to move around in their factory store where you can get 50\u00a2 and $1 markdown product. It's worth the trip, but you have to go early (as soon as they open) to get the better selection(s). You'll see many 'local' labels that they make too, like Sprouts grocery label etc. always a deal when I stop by.",269,1

Deidre did a nice job behind the bar, but our food took a long, long time (two other bar parties got there 10 min after us, but got food served 10-15 min before us).\n\nOverall, didn't live up to the hype, but I'd go back to try out the dinner menu.",116,2
"I went here after work as an end of the weekend meal at a really akward time 5:30pm.  neither really lunch or dinner, but it definetly had everything i wanted as far as linner goes.  My new meal (there just aren't enough in the day to try all these amazing places!)\nAnyway I was plesantly surprised by the unassuming outside and the contrast inside where it was actually quite nice.  The gaming area is totally seperated so that when you are eating you don't feel like you are at a gaming place with food, but rather a restaurant with some machines (if that makes any sense)  The food didn't disappoint either.  The waitress was attentive enough to notice that one of my friend's was killing his diet coke every ten minutes and always kept him supplied well enough.  The spinach and artichoke flatbread pizza was nice and light with a very unique twist of flavors for my tongue!  The Steelz brownie originally came out without any ice cream and we had to ask the waitress and she had to double check the menu to make sure that the ice cream did indeed go on it (minus one star).  However as soon as I had my first bite I could see myself having cravings for the super indulgent mosit chocolatey goodness that was coating my mouth.  I had trouble sharing it with my friends and almost ordered myself another one.\n\nThey were playing the football games of the day going on on multiple screens around the place.  I can't see it ever getting too busy and yet it should be with the unassuming exterior and fantastic food.  I think that once they get to know their own menu a little better the rating could've easily reached a higher star level.  (note this is not a date night place, but more of a sunday afternoon kick it with friends type place.)  fifteen bucks later my stomach and I are quite happy campers!",403,3
"Nothing too special about Moto Sushi outside of their sushi desert which consists of ice cream, nutella, and brownie rolled into a layer of rice krispies and sliced \""like sushi.\""  That might be the only thing sushi about it...because it's \""sliced like sushi.\""  If I sliced a crawfish into sushi roll shapes, would I be able to market it sliced \""like sushi\""?  It was a fun end of the meal treat.\n\nOutside of that unique desert experience, their sushi was just so so.  The waitress had a \""secret menu\"" that she did not even inform us until we had got our order.  My co worker then proceeded to order another roll after we found out about this secret menu.  I'm not sure what is the point of the secret menu if they don't show it to you until you after you receive your food.  What's the point?",189,2

"I have to admit, the acrobat net and dangling go-go dancers above the dance floor was a unique twist on what would otherwise be just your basic Las Vegas club. My real beef with the place is the placement of the dance floor (which was small)  in the direct line of traffic to the bar. There was a constant stream of people going to/coming from the bar that made dancing a drag.  We went on a Thursday and got there at around 11:50 p.m.. Some promoters in the PH casino gave us some free entry wristbands and (with nothing  better to do) we decided to check it out. My boyfriend and I were just down to do something different and spend and hour in a club (any club) so Gallery fit our needs. If we had actually made elaborate plans for this place and paid a cover I would have been deeply disappointed.  The music was all over the place and kept jumping from genre to genre with no real theme.  I prefer some consistency. Some of the music was actually undanceable. It was a mixed crowd and we met some cool people, but there were random chicks in sweaters wearing Ugg boots dancing on tables and older white haired men with Members Only jackets that ... just looked a little out of place. It gave off a sloppy vibe overall. That was my first and last visit.",280,1

"While passing through Phoenix on the way to Cali with my hubby yesterday we stopped in and ordered a BBQ chicken pizza. We out pizza lovers so would never turn one down however given the high rave reviews expected a bit better. Our pizza was good but was skimpy on the toppings and a little on the dry side. It may have been due to the type of cheese that was used and the lack of enough BBQ sauce to make up for the consistency of the cheese (which was not mozzarella) . As i said, I love pizza so still enjoyed it and like the flavor. I would probably go again but try something different. The service was also very good both in attentiveness and speed of delivery.",141,2

The fried noodles with chicken were also swimming in oil.  I may try one more time and get some that are not fried and hope that they are better.",114,2

For dessert we had the New Orleans Beignets which were really good (especially with the chocolate sauce) and there were many of them, enough for breakfast the next day.\n\nService was really great, though I am beginning to equate that with the Scottsdale/Phoenix area and the experience was great.",175,2
"We stayed here this past weekend...\nTo start the hotel is VERY Miami.\nThere are two arrival areas and are very confusing, which in turn made us have a long walk to the check in area. Check-in was painfully slow. Also, cabs are a long wait to be had no matter which entrance you try as the hotel is so far off from the strip.\n\nThe ROOM was nice, yes it's a bit smaller than others but since i went in with low expectations i guess i was nicely surprised. The shower was great and we really liked the mirrors. One day after being gone from 9am-3pm our room had still not been attended to by the housekeepers. ugh.\n\nThe POOL was also nice. Nothing fabulous to report. Especially the service. You can see in my picture that the waitresses often stood at the bar waiting on drinks instead of waiting on customers. It was impossible to get their attention, and when you did - they told you to wait. very disappointing. I will say the food was good. But if you are looking for better and friendlier service, just sit at the bar as the bartenders were great.\n\nThe RESTAURANTS were incredibly slow. You'll see a line at any vegas restaurant or coffee shop, but these were painful. UMAMI service was awful. We waited for almost 15 minutes for any server to come to us for even water, the burgers were ok. To get our check was additional 25 minutes! Don't you want us to be gambling?? I never tried the GRIDDLE as the line was ridiculous and they wouldn't let you take \""to go.\"" My boyfriend went to PERQ for a tea and 35 minutes later finally returned. \n\nThe CASINO was probably the only good item on the list. Though the slot machines haven't been played enough that there was no noise of winnings coming from them. \n\nThe CLUB was decent. I won tickets to see a DJ at LIFE on friday nite, we stayed a total of 20minutes. Nothing better than what i can already receive in NY. and it wasn't even a huge named DJ to get the crowd amp'd. The crowd was very B&T by NY standards.\n\nAll in all, if i had another \""special\"" on the rooms i'd come again. But other than that, we would not return. Not even to gamble.",512,1

It came out after all the burgers and fries.  The bacon on the salad wasn't cooked.

"I really like this place. I have been here a couple of times, for different things. This last time was for an aromatherapy massage ($50 for an hour! It was a special). The masseuse was on time, attentive and did a great job. You get a nice warm robe when you are done and can use the sauna, shower etc in the spa. Apparently, you also have access to the pool for the day, however, I have not ever taken advantage of this. \nThey have a nice morrocan oil mask for your hair available for when you use the sauna, which comes with a little eye mask. The red flower products are the best! I thoroughly enjoy coming here, it is a smaller spa, which is something I like. The staff have always been very friendly and not one bit pretentious.  I recommend getting on the email list, they always run some great specials.

"When I first started working on Dundas Street a few years ago, this became my local! \n\nI'm not saying i'm in there all the time but I do enjoy a fish supper or even just a poke o' chips now and again! :) It does make the walk home just so much brighter!\n\nThis is a lovely, clean, establishment and the staff are so friendly and helpful. I know this place has won lots of awards and most people I know rave about it, so it's definitely built up a rapport!\n\nThe haddock and chips and white puddings are divine and I love the fact they have a great selection of Italian wines and beers to peruse while you wait. The sister cafe/take away 'Anima' next door, is also a lovely lunchtime venue (though much slower service than L'Alba.\n\nA must- try if you're down this way in Edinburgh!",196,4
"I was not a fan of the Espresso because I've had better (mind you, I'm VERY particular and hard to please in this area). But I'm giving three stars because the place is quaint and cozy and the lady that prepared my drink was SO sweet and friendly that I had to give that extra star. \n\nOn top of the fact that I was not crazy about the Espresso, it is on the left side of 16th street going south (which is the way I go to work) so making a left turn for lackluster espresso is just not something within my realm of sanity.\n\nThat being said, if it came down to White Sage or Starbucks, Starbucks can shove it!",150,2
"only tried a couple of items here short rib & an all meat platter with chicken ,pork chop and beef . all was pretty good and cheap and you get a good amount .also you may get tired of buffets. they sell cookies and t shirts at the counter. if you get a chance go to vegas 808 it is across the way it has all kinds of snacks !",79,3
"One of my husband's coworkers had frequently mentioned this as one of her favorite places, so when we landed here after striking out a few other places on a Friday night, I was expecting a lot. Fortunately, Flat Top definitely delivered. They are willing to call you when your table is ready, so that you aren't stuck waiting in the tiny vestibule, the only real waiting area (on a cold, snowy night, it was nice to be able to wait somewhere warmer). Our server did a great job explaining the process to us newbies- write your name on a table-numbered stick, fill up your bowl with your choice of carbs, veggies, meats, sauces, select any extras, and leave your bowl for the stir fry. One of the sticks you can add is for allergy concerns. I wish I had paid better attention to the color coding system for what flavors go together, and will do that next time.",187,3
"honestly, i was very disappointed when i came here for frozen hot chocolate.\ni frequent both new york and vegas, so when i saw that they opened one here i was quite excited and was looking forward to their signature dessert.\n\nit was nothing like the original one in new york!!\nfirst, i thought it was smart that they made a take out counter to avoid the 2hour line, but i'd rather wait that extra hour and 55min if i knew their drink tasted that bad.\nfirst, it was watered down, second, i had chunks of unblended ice in my drink!! \n\nthis branch does not give serendipity 3 a good image at all...so if you never tried it and heard of it, wait for new york.",163,1
"I was hoping to try out some local coffee in the new Bodum Vacuum coffee maker that I got for Christmas. \n\nWasn't too excited to find that they had only Illy coffee. Got Sausage breakfast sandwich which wasn't extraordinary. The everything bagel didn't remind us of New York. \n\nThe baristas were friendly and cheerful and the environment of the coffee shop inside an old coffee shop is unique, although it's not unthinkable in today's hipster coffee generation. The big windows let plenty of light in and give a nice view of downtown Carnegie with its mix of old and new.\n\nBriefly put, nice ambience but slightly lacking in coffee and food.",145,2
"I have been looking for something to challenge myself in the fitness department--not only because I have been at a plateau with my weight loss for awhile but also because running on the treadmill and doing the same weight lifting has become BORING!

After the first class I new this was exactly what I had been looking for. It was a challenge, a great workout and super fun! After only 2 classes I finally saw the scale move and realized this is exactly what I needed.  The atmosphere is great, everyone is super friendly and most importantly I am looking forward to working out again! I absolutely LOVE this place! \n\nP.S. Blackout Boxing is a MUST!!!!

I really do love this place. It's the definition of a hole in the wall. \n\nFirst of all this place is small...I mean really small so it can only get so busy and it does get busy at peak hours so plan accordingly.  \n\nAs you can imagine with a location as small as this the service is usually very quick. The staff is always very attentive to your needs as well.\n\nThe menu is clean and neat..and the options that it has...are stellar. having tried most of the dishes on the menu I honestly say they are all great! My favorite is the Veal Parm..huge portions and just great taste.\n\nGive this place a try...you will not regret it. If you go in peak lunch or dinner hours make a reservation...you will need it.,176,3
"The person working in this shoe repair shop is completely incompetent.  I took a pair of Christian Louboutin's ($1,200) and a pair of Valentino ($900) for a rubber sole to protect the bottom of the shoes.  Not only the work was over priced ($50) but also, they completely ruined my shoes!  They put the rubber sole half way up the back of the shoes when they were supposed to put the rubber sole on the BOTTOM of the shoe only.  I can't no longer wear either pair because they look cheap, fake, and ridiculous with a cut off piece of rubber glued to the back of the shoes.  I wouldn't care if this happened to a pair of inexpensive shoes; but I trusted this store with my designer shoes and they did not care for them.  I confronted the repair man and he stone walled me as if it wasn't his problem or his fault. I feel I just flushed over $2000 that I paid for these two pairs of shoes down the toilet.",219,0
"People screw up pizza a LOT. Seriously, I just don't think anyone even realizes how many ways people get it wrong. As the stars probably gave away, I feel Grimaldi's is different. \n\nThe ingredients are fresh and put on the pizzas in that wonderful sweet spot of being plentiful but not overcrowded. The sauce isn't drowning everything, nor is it barely there. The crust is thin, crispy and actually manages to not be either overpowering or taste like lifeless cardboard. \n\nLet me put this another way. A lot of people in this city claim to have New York style pizza. Grimaldi's actually does. Not only that, but the interior makes it plainly obvious that whoever designed it has actually been to the east coast at some point, unlike most places that overdo it and try to shove east coast culture down your throat in the design in order to make you think that's what it looks like. \n\nSorry...I'm a Jersey native. It drives me nuts the way so many restaurants get it all wrong, be it food or design or usually both. Grimaldi's makes me actually think of home and the little pizza restaurants you'd find there. It looks like it, it tastes like it. If you want GOOD New York style pizza, go here. It's pretty much that simple.",281,4
"Maybe we've never had a Chicago Style pizza before! If this place makes so called authentic style Chicago Style pizza, then we don't ever want it again.  Not only was it the worst pizza ever, it also cost $30.00!\nWe ordered a 18\"" thin crust with pepperoni, sausage & mushrooms. The toppings were very sparse.  There was a lot of cheese, but it was weird, not the usual pizza cheese.\n\nBad mistake to try a local place, Pizza Hut is 200 % better and cheaper.\nWe do not recommend this place for pizza.",130,0
"We decided that we wanted to see the concert that was at the capital and got downtown around 7:45, put our name on a list (they text you when your table is read!) and were seated outside around 8:30.

While in town, we had tried a couple of different places for cheese curds but this really took the cake! Since we were traveling for business the waiter said he could get us all the sauces to try (which I recommend doing) because they are all so tasty!\n\nAfter the cheese curds, I opted for the Fatty Boombalatty which went well with my Spicy Burger. The spice burger was delicious, it had local grass-fed beef (love it!) with pepperjack cheese, jalapenos, fried onions, bacon and paprika! As a New Orleans lady, spicy stuff does not impress me but something on this burger made my eyes water! They know how to use their spices. \n\nThe cheese curds were so good, my coworker ordered some as a side for her prime rib sammy!\n\nIf I didn't want to try a new restaurant for every meal, I would return!",289,3
"Went here by myself once when I went to Vegas. Figured it's sharks, it has to be cool, right?

The server seemed great and knew her stuff.  I had the pulled pork sandwich that had plenty of yummy, gooey bbq sauce all over the meat and bun.  It did not disappoint my belly whatsoever.

More importantly, WHY weren't we offered something else instead of a boot??? Our waitress kept saying she was trying to locate an extra, but 40 minutes into our dinner, I told her to get us beer NOW or we're walking out. She brought us, a table of nine people, a half pitcher of beer and small miller light glasses...  What??? Not even beer steins??? 'They're not even busy!'

"Found these guys online and they said they had the heat lamps we needed in stock.  I drove clear across town for them, brought them back to our restaurant to be installed the next morning.  Upon inspection of the finished work I noticed they sold me the wrong item, ones without an adjustable heat controller.  \n\nAfter numerous discussions their \""fix\"" was to get the OEM controllers and install them for us, what they said is an accepted practice with the manufacturer.   Took over a month to get this accomplished.  Fast forward about 6 more months and we are having trouble with them.  They said we needed to go to the manufacturer, even though the part we are having issue with was the controller they installed.  Generation Y wanted $250 to fix it (the whole unit only cost us $275!!!).\n\nWe contacted the manufacturer and were told that due to what Generation Y did, they VOIDED the warranty!!!  Great!  Have spent the last 1+ months trying to get Generation Y to stand behind their work and fix this.  They conceded and offered to do it for for the reduced prices of $182...still almost the cost of an entire new unit!!\n\nNow, again after MANY correspondences they are refusing to do anything about this.  I have never seen such horrible customer service and incompetence.  How you propose to fix something you sell that voids the warranty and then don't stand behind it yourself is beyond rational thought.  There are so many places in the valley (and online) to choose from, I would steer very clear of Generation Y...which I think stand for Y would anyone go there?",349,0
"My new favorite Peruvian restaurant. I had the tallarines verdes with the bistek on the side (for my carnivorous husband) because I don't eat meat and they were more than accommodating and did not seem to judge me for doing that (which most places do). The tallarines verdes is the best I've had in Arizona and I will only go to El Chullo to have it. You know how you grab on to your bed sheets because the feeling is so glorious and out of this world? Yes, it's like that! I can't wait to try the other entrees, specifically, the vegetarian options. The alfajores is also delicious; flaky but held it's form and not overwhelmingly sweet - it definitely quieted my sweet tooth. The chicha morada is also quenching - not bitter and too sweet, just right - be sure to order the pitcher because you will drink it like water.\n\nIt's a quaint place to eat. They have lunch specials/combo. The parking situation is a little challenging, but I would like to go there at least once a week to satisfy my Peruvian food cravings. I hope you check out this place because although it's easy to miss (because of location), you'll be sorry if you don't go.",269,4
Great atmosphere but the food is... weird.  I ordered a pancetta and arugula pizza.  It came as a pancetta pizza with a huge pile of raw arugula dumped on top.  I felt like I had to do some gardening in order to get to the pizza.  No cheese.  And then it cost 20 bucks.,75,2

Our group of 6 had no trouble finding seats for lunch. We ordered a few rounds of appetizers and meals. The pretzel fondue was good, but I have to say I love it more from Brat Haus. The burratta with pears and bacon syrup was great, but I wish I would have tasted more bacon. I had the house smoked salmon which was pretty good but not great. The salmon was delicious, but I could have done without cracked pepper on the poached egg, and it was a bit messy to put the whole thing together (toast, salmon, capers/sauce, egg) into an edible combination. The onions that came with it were super strong and I pulled those off right away. That being said, there were enough other things on the menu that I might be willing to give this one another shot.",244,2

"Their services are overpriced but reasonably consistent, but I still wouldn't recommend them.  They called us almost every day for months, so finally I picked up the phone to their recorded message saying there was a problem with the bill (which there never was).  So, since I wanted to get this pain in the butt settled, I followed instructions to talk to a customer service rep.  Their idea of customer service is a joke.  This woman claimed that the phone number might still be attached to an old account (we've lived here 2 years!), verified the address, phone number, name on the bill, last 4 of the social and then asked my partner to verify since it's in his name.  I put him on the phone, he verified his name and that he wanted the calls to stop, and it should have been done right then and there.  No such luck,  She kept rambling about how he had to get back on the phone to repeat all of the same info I just gave her.  What a lazy bunch of jackasses.

"I have been a patron of this establishment for many years. My brother is a dj in vegas and I always refer this place even when he has his friends stay at cosmopolitan but after my last experience I will never stay and I will never refer this establishment to my friends.\n\nI arrived at the Encore and felt the usual excitement of Vegas and I was stoked because I love the red decor and the smell of their air fresheners. I was greeted by the front desk as usual checkin was smooth. After I got into the room I wanted a shower... that was until I saw blood all over the damn shower. I chose to skip the shower and ask for them to fix the issue. The front desk said they would send someone up. After about an hour and a half they finally sent someone to clean the windows....yes I said windows. I had to specify the shower is what needed to be cleaned because there was blood. I left the room and when I came back the room smelled so strongly of bleach I didn't want to stay in it. I left and came back decided to shower and the blood was still all over the place. Since it had been now a day since showering I had to stand on the bench to avoid contact with the blood.\n\nI wish it got better but it did not. I was visiting my best friend for his birthday and we decided to have a few drinks in the room and talk as it had been a while since we had spoken and a security guard by the name of Anthony stopped at the door to let us know we needed to quiet down because we had noise complaints. We had no music or anything out of the ordinary and he said he didn't hear anything but was instructed to ask us to quiet down. He came for a second time and said this is your third warning and your friend must leave. I asked who I needed to speak with to handle the issue. Anthony said to speak with the casino manager, that would have been helpful if that person was available but I had to speak with the front desk manager who said if I didn't quiet down she would have to kick me out....\n\nAfter I left vegas and submitted my complaint via the email survey it took 3 weeks to get a response and they said my feedback was important and had been sent to management... 2 months later I am posting this review, I gave them ample time to respond to me and I still have not heard from them other than their spam post mail with offers to stay with them. \n\nDo not waste your valuable and hard earned money here.

"This location is by far the worst of them all. I have watched the steadily declining food quality and service since they have opened. Our last experience this last time was the kicker. The waitress was a young girl with very little social skills and really needed help with articulation and volume. She had trouble multitasking and lacked attentiveness. But the other servers picked up the slack. So all was good. We ordered gyro, fatoosh and cilantro hummus. Cilantro hummus is always consistent and good. The gyro not so much. The meat was cooked like bacon: crisp, crumbly and almost considered burnt. It had to be sent back. The return food was decent but had some mystery meat wrapped inside that we will assume for our piece of mind was grill bits.  The fatoosh is 3/4 rice, which is awesome if you love rice, not awesome if you are looking for a light flavorful salad that is typical with fatoosh. The kicker, the manager and other servers wiped up tables that were considerably messy that had children seated at them with DRY napkins. No bleach/ disinfectant / wet towels used. And promptly sat another families with children at those tables. Poor quality food, subpar service I can tolerate. Not uncleanliness and poor hygiene. I will visit the other locations.",260,1

I have eaten here many times in the past and have always liked the food (especially the Thai Beef Salad) and the price.Today I realized I had not been in a few years so I took an out of town friend here who loves ethnic food. I made the mistake to do a weekday lunch during normal lunch time. I think that  might have been the first time I did that and probably my last. (live and learn I guess)\n   The food was just OK, not great, not bad. They usually have unique and wonderfully tasty desserts but the carrot cake was just average. Maybe they had run out of their cool tarts and ethic fun treats. In the past they had always given out their wonderfully delicious banana bread free with their bread baskets( worth the trip alone) but not today. I did get their little cinnamon toasts though. YEAH!) My Chicken Slaw Salad was fine, good, but again not great. So I guess I am not sure if they have changed the way they do things or maybe it was just an off day. I just wasn't as wowed as I used to be and the place was ridiculously packed. \n   The thing that always gets to me in an annoying way here is how surprisingly bad the service is. It has always been terrible and continues to be so. Sad. I waited ten minutes to even be acknowledged when I walked through the door. The food service wasn't great either. They have always needed more help so it confused me when they expanded several years back. I see they still don't get it. If you are a busy, popular establishment please staff accordingly.  \n   If you want to try dining here there are still some positives. I would just go off hours and somehow get them to give you a slice of their Banana Bread. lol! The lunch specials were rather cheap actually so that's another positive, but be prepared to be in a cramped and crowded restaurant.",463,2
"I remember eating Guthrie's all the time on the East Coast years ago.  I was pretty excited to find out there was one here in Vegas. (I tried Cane's a few times but have always been disappointed, so seeing Guthrie's made my day.) I got the box meal which includes toast, fries, 5 chicken strips, coleslaw and a drink.  All for $6.99.  Not too bad of a deal price wise. \n\nThe food was okay. The size of the chicken strips were small, and I have to say the coleslaw was a disappointment! Absolutely  no flavor!  Will I come here again? Yes, but I won't drive out of my way to come here like I did today. If I happen to be in the neighborhood I would stop by...oh and they charge you .38 for an extra sauce.  It comes with 1 sauce per meal and they are the tiny dipping cups :-/",205,2
"Maybe I haven't come off my runner's high yet, but this year's Rock N' Roll Marathon was AWESOME!!!  Great set up!  Great organization!!  So much fun!\n\nBig props to the volunteers, organizers, and Mandalay Bay for making everything run so smoothly!  I really appreciate the fact that the cleaning staff set up camp in the women's restrooms, consistently ensuring paper towels, toilet paper, and soap for all.  Despite the hundreds of port of potties there is a realization that women are going to the use the facilities with running water if given a choice. \n\nFood vendors were open, Bellagio fountains were running, Mirage volcano was erupting, bands were rockin.  It was fabulous!  The Border Grill was especially accomodating, set up to provide food specials, as well as alcohol specials.  Nothing's better than a beer or good margarita after a half marathon or marathon.\n\nThe Bret Michaels concert right afterwards was awesome!  Yep!  Bret Michaels = awesome!  Rock of Love, baby!  So much better than having the concert later on in the evening.\n\nAlso, a big thanks to the Las Vegas police for blocking off roads and directing traffic.  It was much better than last year.  So smooth getting in and out.\n\nMy only complaint would be that there was not a great selection of food in the \""secure zone\"" (they had ice cream last year!) and no free food outside the secure zone.  But I got my free beer (thanks to the MGD guy for not requiring me to show my ID, speeding the process along!) and was feeling no pain so the lack of food didn't bother me.  Oh... also this year they didn't have tigers at the start.  Last year they did. I like tigers.\n\nTips for those considering the marathon or half-marathon in the future:\n\n1) Park at Mandalay Bay.  Don't pay attention to what any signs say.  It is your God-given right to park at Mandalay Bay as a runner.\n\n2) Enter the hotel and follow the signs to the convention center and Shark Reef.\n\n3) Try to figure out a way to comfortably carry a camera or cell phone with a camera.  You won't regret it (unless you drop it so be careful).  \n\n4) After completing the run, you may be confused.  You will be led through something called the \""secure zone\"" to take a picture with a showgirl and pick up food.   Once you leave the secure zone, they won't let you back in and this may be the only free food AND WATER you get so...\na) carry a small grocery bag with you on the run so you can easily load up with food and water (this was my co-worker's suggestion and I can't thank him enough).\nb) make sure you get one of those disposable blanket thingys.  You may not want one right away, but you may later.  Better safe than sorry.\nc) take a picture with a showgirl!  They say its not mandatory but it is.  No matter how bad you are feeling... do it!  It'll make you feel better.\n\n5) Most of all... HAVE FUN!!  Like my friend said, everyone is there for your entertainment.  Be entertained!!\n\nSee the photos documenting some of the fun.",736,4
"The airport in Las Vegas is definitely a reflection of the Las Vegas strip and all that it is famous for. Lingering stench of cigarette smoke, old lady perfume and the peculiar mixture of hopefulness and despair, which hangs heavy in the stale air.  \n\nProps to slot machines at every turn, the airport would do well to place the same, or even a fraction of the same, care in the shopping and restaurant choices. \n\nMy least favorite experience upon arrival at this airport is the Disneylandesque length of the taxi queue.",113,2
"To quote my boyfriend, we like this place because \""they're solid.\"" Every time we order here, the food is great and fresh. I always get their sweet and sour chicken and I am never disappointed. Instead of chicken chunks coated in batter, this place uses a chicken breast with batter that I would describe to be a thin tempura like batter. There is no excess batter or fat chunks to deal with it. The service is fast and we see the same waiter every time we eat here. This is the my go to place for Chinese food.",113,3
Food is OK. They tend to overcook the burgers so adjust accordingly. Service has been fantastic every time I have been there (usually under duress) but I care fuck-all about that. \n\nYou won't be disappointed here but you won't be thrilled either.,61,1
Wow!!!!! All I can say is by far the most arrogant body shop I've ever been to. Right from the very beginning I was disappointed with the attitude from the estimator. My girlfriend banged up her front bumper on her car. We took it there as we were told that they specialize in the higher end cars. Not only was the estimate written $800.00 over the other 3 we got but it shows less work then the other 3 estimates we got. These guys are ripping people off as they feel high end cars mean wealthy people who don't look closely at their bills. As soon as I questioned the total being so high compared to other estimates I then saw the attitude from the estimator. I ended up taking the vehicle to another 4th body shop located in the same parking lot. Thank you Metropolitan Auto Body and Paint!,175,0
"Full service atmosphere and very clean.   They have what you want and will order it if they don't. The company is very civic minded and gives a lot to schools and charities.\n\n*Side note* Food is a little on the pricey-side in this area, compared to Chicago and New York. I'm sorry the \""cost of living is so much cheaper in the south\"", does not apply in Charlotte. (or at most any other grocery stores in this area-I wonder why?!)",106,3
"YUM!  Finally, a place we like.  This place is really clean, pretty, and contemporary :)...unusual for a Pho restaurant right?  The original location is in northern Cali so we were totally excited to get there.  The menu is very simple but enough to satisfy your taste buds.  Oh, the restaurant is away from the major street hidden behind other shops so be patient.\n\n*Food = very good\n-chicken wings = YUM YUM YUM. You should really try it at least once.\n-Spring rolls = I never had it with such a nice aroma\n-Korean bbq = I don't know why my bf ordered this at a Pho place but it was good.\n-Pho = to be honest, it was a little bland BUT good.",167,3
"Went here on the back of seeing this on the food network. went for brunch, I had the french onion burger and it was very good. I wouldn't be fan of seating upstairs as it was like been on a bouncing castle. All in all it was a very positive experience",58,3
"Pretty disappointed. Although this place brought back found memories of my elementary school cafeteria... It was a far cry from the expectation set by Bellagio and Ceasars.  Save yourself the cash and play it on black. This place had great service, with cold, mediocre food at best.",59,1
"I should preface my review by saying that my breakfast here came after waking up still drunk from the night before.  Rather than pile on the gluttony at the very nice buffet, I wanted something simple and easy, so I picked the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The service there was nice, friendly and congenial and they were good at everything but serving the food.\n\nI had the eggs benedict.  The dish was unremarkable.  The sauce was fine, the poached eggs were just alright, the muffin was burnt.  The potatoes seemed like they were designed by a chef trying hard to deliver something nice, but again they were unremarkable.  I would rank the good ol' Grand Slam breakfast on a par with what I got at the Terrace Pointe and if you're in the Wynn Hotel, that ain't good enough.",174,1
"I must say, I'm really impressed with how great food here is, especially when you think about it as \""bar food.\""\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I went here one lazy Sunday afternoon. We sat out on the patio. These guys had some great drink specials, $2.50 beers. They also have a good beer selection. I ordered the Southern Style burger, but with a black bean patty. It was delicious. Pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes, yum! The black bean patty itself was pretty delicious too. The side of caesar salad was pretty standard. My fianc\u00e9 got the pulled pork sandwich and we had chicken fingers. I liked both of those, but the Southern Style burger took the limelight.",161,4
"This was for my girlfriend's 30th birthday and she loves sushi so I wanted to treat her to a place that is nice. As we approached the front entrance of Sushi Roku, we were greeted by two skinny cold looking hosts. As one of them escorted us to the table, she nonchalantly asked how I was doing but it wasn't very sincere. She seated us right in front where we can see ... the outside to the mall. I caught a quick glimpse of the darker area of the restaurant that supposedly have a great view of the strip lit up.\n\nNeedless to say, at least our server was nice. I told him we had a show to catch (Peep Show) and the order came out very quickly. We ordered:\n\n- Foie Gras wrapped in Yellow tail sashimi (foie gras was over powering and salty)\n- Toro (don't remember what it even tastes like, not impressed)\n- Japanese Yellow Tail Sashimi with Diced Chiles (too salty)\n- Chilean Seabass w/Yuzu butter (this was a flavorful dish. The bass was very well cooked)\n- Kobe Beef Skewers w/ Black Pepper Sauce (flavorful and tender; thumbs up)\n- Spicy Tuna and Rainbow Roll (rolls were pretty good size and tasted fresh)\n\nTotal for 2 people: $216 including 1 mojito and 1 cocktail\n\nWould I go back? Only if I get a chance to have a nice view of the strip at night but besides that, not really.",327,2
I had fun here a couple times and the place has really gone downhill. I kind of feel bad for some of the \n\nstaff because it looks like this place has a major management issue. I also notice that every time I come \n\nit's a whole new staff. The drinks are also not as good as the other places around. I visited on NCOD \n\nweekend when the place should be packed but was a disappointment.,95,1
"The food was kinda bland. However, to be able to sit and eat crab legs all night was totally worth it. I will never pay full price for this buffet, I got the Groupon and even that seemed overpriced for their selection.y advice, stay off the strip better bang for your buck at the Station Casino's buffets.",70,2
"This place is amazing. The quality of the fish and food quality is top notch fresh. I love salmon and I usually get some derivative of a salmon lover roll and seaweed salad whenever I go out for sushi. After hearing about my love of salmon, John, the owner and chef told me that he would make something very special for me. He ended up bringing me the most delicious sashimi salmon salad. It wasn't any salad. There were so many big pieces of salmon sashimi in there I was in heaven! .... It melted in my mouth and was super fresh.  If u go here, know that u don't have to just order off the menu. Just look for John and tell him what u like. He used to be the executive chef at Social House sushi at Aria so the stuff he makes is top grade. I will definitely be back!!",176,4
"I called a day early to reserve a table at 1pm on a Saturday for 10 for my mom's 75th birthday.  When we arrived, they had given our table to another group, assuming it was ours, so we had to wait while they put together another table in the back, and locate chairs for us, too.  The place is tiny but they managed to fit us all together eventually.  We had a sampling of most of the foods between us, and the pierogi's were excellent, but I wasn't a huge fan of the tomato sauce on the golabki.  Full disclosure, my mom makes most of the food on the menu at home, so I'm a bit spoiled and used to great Polish foods. However, the pork cutlet was amazing and even their kids meal fried and chicken tenders were great.  The service was slow, with only 2 servers in the full restaurant, but they were very nice and accommodating. They even sang Happy Birthday in Polish, too! I may go again if we're in the Matthews area as the prices were also very reasonable, but probably won't make the drive from Charlotte too often.",247,3
"Meh. \n\nOverpriced, psuedo urban hoity toity experience. \n\nShould you come here at least once and try some house cocktails for $10 each? Sure, why not. \n\nBut is this a place to frequent? Not at all, well except phonys. Phonys will love this place. Holden, however would hate it.",81,1
"I like the chopped salad and club sandwich.\n\nNot necessarily \""healthy\"" but wholesome.\n\nThe outdoor seating area is nice in the fall or a spring day.\n\nI throw this in to the mix for lunch once and a while, but only on days that I have more than 60 minutes available.",70,2
Love this place- consistently good and friendly. Portions may even be too large. Come here for breakfast when visiting AZ twice a year and will keep coming back.,33,3
"This is a really professional, friendly and comfortable place to learn and have fun.  We needed a refresher course before a big wedding, so we responded to an advertised package, liked what and how we were taught, and had no hesitation in signing up for more lessons.  We're almost ready for the wedding and now we're planning additional instruction for the next big event.  We've even joined in a few group lessons.  Our instructor makes the lessons fun, and there is just the right balance between technical and style instruction, understanding our level of competence, and keeping it light and encouraging.  We always look forward to the lessons.",133,4
"Ordered take out for the first time tonight...I suspect someone will be contacting me shortly regarding some missing hockey pucks, somehow they made it between the hamburger buns in my container of sliders.\n\nSo, we tried the ribs, cheeseburger sliders, fries, sweet potato fries, and mac & cheese.  \n\nRibs were generous in portion but fatty and just not worth eating.  The sliders I mentioned earlier are tiny individual patties that were black around the edges and chewy (like pucks), topped with a tiny piece of cheese on a bun  (no lettuce, pickle, flavor).  Their \""au jus\"" for the burgers was served on the side and had no taste whatsoever, it wasn't even the \""salt assault\"" style au jus that low rent places usually serve.  Mac and cheese was mushy and flavorless.  Fries were good.  Sweet potato fries never made it into the bag.\n\nOne common theme to all of the dishes was a complete lack of flavor.  On the plus side, we didn't dine there so we were spared the sound of screaming children while we ate.  I'm sure if you got a cold beer and some potato skins you'd probably be fairly content.  As far as a real dinner goes, absolutely not - it's terrible.",275,0
"Here's why I like this place.  Its in a good location if you have to wait for a movie.  Run over to Barnes & Nobles and read a magazine or book, or grab coffee while you wait.  There's almost always some good restaurants right next to it.\n\nWhy I gave it only 3 stars is because now if you see a movie after 12noon (coorrection, believe it's 5PM.. but still!).. its $10.50.  Uh. what???  I really try to see movies on Sat/Sun before noon, but sometimes it just doesnt happen.  Remember going out on the weekends??  Also their seats aren't the best.  Ive always said.. the ultimate theater is AMCs movie/sound with Harkins seats.  Guess what?  AMC near Cardinals Stadium? Yeah... they did it.  Kudos to them.\n\nAll in all this place is still good to see movies and I was just here last week.",215,2
"There is nothing better than fried food, specifically broccoli, after some (or many) drinks at the Pig. Service is usually good, great considering the fact that they're putting up with a lot of drunken shenanigans. Also, you can get fried food to go and take it back to the Pig or Mike and Molly's.",68,3
Addicting Brunch. MANY veggie options,9,3
"I ordered a pasty stuffed with ground beef, French fries, onions, melted Swiss Cheddar blend, and it was DELICIOUS. They're so big, my friend and I (both of us girls) split one, so it was only $4.50 each. I also got the mushroom spinach soup, which comes with homemade (I think) bread and butter, and the soup was warm, thick, and not too creamy. We finished off with the Shirley Temple for dessert, an amazing toffee, chocolatey bread pudding that comes with a white cream you can stir into it. Restaurant is pretty dark inside, and they play loud Indie music, so I wouldn't go with a client or boss, but with friends, it's great. Just the right volume so you can notice the music, but still have a conversation.",172,4
"I love lobster!!!!! Lobster roll and lobster mac n cheese are awesome! It's expensive, but locals get 20% off. Oh, and try the garlic fries! Yum!",39,4
"After going there for brunch recently (for which I'd give it four stars), I insisted on trying it again for dinner, as I had seen the pizzas coming out of the oven as we were leaving and they looked/smelled ridiculous. It made me hungry and I had just stuffed myself full of delicious  brunch foods. \nHowever.\nThe second was not the same experience. We were highly disappointed at the server not being able/willing/whatever to help us with our appetizer selection. When it came (artisan cheese plate), it made us both frown. Four bold, flavorful, strong cheeses, fig spread and honey, bowl of olives, crostini, almonds. (Boyfriend, when I offered him some almonds, said \""No thanks, I just had some in the car.\"" Touche.) Just a poor arrangement of flavors...truly. Like, throw some sharp provolone and mozz on a plate and call it a day. (AHEM. YOU ARE EAT N PARK)\nBoyfriend entr\u00e9e was the half chicken. Have you ever seen one of those cute little chickies around Easter time? Sweet little baby chickens? That is the approximate size of the chicken they butchered for this clove (????)-filled  dish, complete with \""smoked potatoes\"", i'm sorry, WHAT? \nI believe it was when he bit into a whole clove that he asked me to make him shells and cheese when we got home.\nThen I started adding up our approximate bill.... \nAll of that aside, the pizza was, in fact, as ridiculously delicious as it looked/smelled on that brunch day, and the drinks were PERFECTION (the \""almost arnie\"" and \""porch pink lemonade\""). Probably some of the best mixed specialty drinks I've had anywhere. \nSo my point is...it is supremely disappointing that such a cool place (atmosphere A+++) is trying so hard. Just shut up and make a bunch of awesome pizzas. Because they are that--awesome. \nIf you go, get the pizzas and some fun drinks. Don't attempt an entr\u00e9e. You've been warned.",456,1
"I'm from Mississippi and am here working for 2 months....\""love\"" this little restaurant! The waitress hasn't suggested anything that I didn't love! It's great food with even better service!",46,4
Decent breakfast. We tried a little of everything and shared. The cream cheese sauce is a great touch.,22,3
"Ordered take out today, disappointed with the rolls, very ordinary and unappealing for the price, just didn't taste great. Maybe wrong food choice or maybe take out is not smart for sushi. Mango mochi is avoidable too, too sweet and overwhelming artificial tasting flavor. Wish I had better news!",63,2
I have to say that this was the worst food that we have ever had at this franchise. Our server was attentive and on top of things. We never had to ask for anything. However the food was horrible. We decided to grab a quick bite after running errands with our little one. The food was just bad. We live in the area but we will never go back.  \n\nI also hate when cleaning products are left out on tables next to you while you eat..... For the entire time.,105,1
"Honestly, I was not that impressed.  I came here hearing a ton of hype, so maybe my expectations were a bit too high.  For my meal I had the tofu tacos which frankly tasted somewhat bland, and not very substantial given the price.  I do find that the happy hour specials are a steal and worth while.  Perhaps I would have been better served trying another dish.  Either that or maybe this place is great for the non-vegetarians out there, but not so great for vegetarians.",105,2
"I've stayed at the Rio a couple times now, most recently because it was the cheapest (for a decent hotel) on only a couple days notice.  The rooms are nice and the rooms are huge.  There is a complimentary refrigerator for your in-suite beverages and plenty of room to get ready if you are staying with multiple people.  The place is huge and has pretty much every you need on site from eating to gambling to drinking to entertainment (though I've never seen a show there).  The rooftop bar is nice, giving you a great view of the Strip.  The only downside with it being a bit off the Strip I probably saw most of my savings going towards cab fares.  Otherwise a nice hotel for the price point, I'd probably stay again.",161,2
"Great falafel! Hummus was absolutely delicious, service was great very clean place . We will be back to try more.",26,4
"I've been sad lately because the girl I normally go to for waxing at the salon left over a year ago. Since then I have tired of paying the old salon $30 to do it wrong 95% of the time. \n\nNeedless to say, I have way too much hair on my face. What's a girl to do? \n\nUntil today I was a total threading virgin and I spent some time psyching myself up in the parking lot/ hyperventilating before I gathered the courage to walk in. I mean, $10 to rip the hair off your eyebrows and the chance to maybe not look like a wooly mammoth all the time? Probably worth the risk.\n\nI'm glad I tried it! I was in a chair 4 seconds after I walked in the door, so I didn't have much time to regret it or run away. The internets told me that threading is more painful than waxing, but I did not find that to be the case at all. \n\nOkay, I cried. A little. But it's because threading isn't like waxing. It takes more time to rip hair off your face with thread than it does with hot wax. However, it doesn't burn and leave your eyes swollen for hours afterwards, it just takes a little longer and makes your eyes water more. After I got over the initial anxiety about new people, places and experiences it was actually a little relaxing. As relaxing as a hair removal experience can possibly be, anyway.\n\nFor me, the results are absolutely worth it and the price was amazing. She did an excellent job with very little direction and I no longer feel like a sad wooly mammoth. She didn't even make fun of me for the haphazard job I've been doing myself for the past few months. I'd say that's a win.",395,4

"I seem to always get up sold whenever I go to an Autobell. The problem is, I spend more money thinking I will get better service but it is never the case with autobell.

"I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation,  even they can screw it up if they don't pay attention to detail, and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a better cup at Martys Market for crying out loud!",103,1
"\""WOW, this place is EXPENSIVE!\"" ... is what I would say if Dean & Deluca cut all their prices in half.\n\nI'm giving them 1 star because I feel that they make no effort at all to cater to anyone other than the uber-rich.   Like everything else in Phillips Place, D&D is just another spot where the wealthiest people in Charlotte can spend obscene sums of money on stuff they really don't need, while the rest of the country struggles to find employment and to stop their houses from being foreclosed upon.\n\nDon't get me wrong, D&D has high-quality, delicious foods.  If I had a few million dollars in the bank, and didn't mind getting ripped off, I'd probably do all my shopping here.",170,0
"One of the best cigar shops in town.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, whether you are new to cigars or a long-time smoker.  The humidor is HUGE and their selection is great.

The clientele are also very friendly and varied in backgrounds, and I've made many new friends just hanging out.",99,4

The Good: \nThe bartender from Forest Hills.\nDale's Pale Ale\n2 Bucks off Drinks during happy hour.\n\nThe Bad: \nHoney Whiskey with Mango Ice Tea\nMusic. There is such a thing as too much Primus.\nHappy Hour or Late Night - the place is empty.,69,1

"I'm really bummed about having to leave such a low rating because the service was GREAT! The food...not so much.  Since it's a diner I decided on something greasy & fried, like chicken strips & gravy, my usual at these kind of places.  The gravy was delicious but the chicken strips tasted & looked exactly like the cheap ones that you buy in the freezer section & heat up. Really bad.  I could tell these were def not hand breaded which was disappointing.  My husband got a grilled ham & cheese sandwich which he said was good but pretty greasy. As for the service, they were all so sweet but the food didn't wow us one bit. Sad to say, I probably won't be back.",155,2

"Reading the reviews, I was a bit wary of this buffet, but it actually ended up being not that bad. Average, but good.\n\nWe visited at Noontime on Saturday. To note, they gave us the option to buffet with or without champagne. So there is not a forced purchase as others have mentioned.\n\nAll the food was warm, the service was steady, and our refills came often.\n\nThe one downside I could find this visit was that the Asian food section was bland. \nHowever the omelette station was great, and there was also a great selection of desserts.\n\nOverall don't come expecting this to be the Bellagio buffet or something high-class or fancy. Just remember where you're visiting.",158,2
"I was a little \""cautious\"" heading to Mez for dinner as I had seen and heard things that weren't great, customer service wise but it was an A-OK night! A friend and I grabbed dinner  on a quiet Sunday night. The only other folks in the restaurant was a couple celebrating a birthday. We had the best service at our table. The waiter Richard was a joy! He was attentive without being a stalker, pleasant and when even shared his favorite dish (rigatoni--which I got and it was delish) My friend got the scallops and a ceasar salad, she seemed pleased. The scallops were meaty and the presentation for all dishes were great. Maybe the quiet night was on our side but anyhoo it was enjoyable and our waiter but the \""A\"" in my A-OK review.",171,2
"I went here yesterday and got the chicken and beef fried rice and the Sudado di mariscos. After reading the great reviews on yelp, I was excited but the food was disappointing at best. The hot pot sauce tasted like salty water and was otherwise flavorless. The fried rice was blackened from the hefty use of soy sauce. Don't think I will be going back to this place.",80,1
"I found this company to be very unprofessional. They were disorganized and did not have set prices on anything in the store. One of the employees' wives was hanging out in the lobby, on Facebook and eating lunch. As there were only two employees working, we were forced to wait 35 minutes for them to finish with another customer. One of the employees had to constantly consult with the other in regards to pricing. All in all, I had a less than pleasing experience and I can't even honestly say that I got a good deal on my bike. Next time, I plan on trying Tempe Bicycle.",124,1
"The best thing about this place is the quality  and freshness of the ingredients. Pizza was surprisingly delicious. My girlfriend loves that they offer fresh mozzarella and spicy sausage. I was impressed by their overall customer service and friendliness. We've been here twice in the past week, and each time our pizza was great. Customizing your own pizza for one low price of $7.75 is unheard of, especially given the quality. I Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves pizza. Try it out and don't be shy to add multiple toppings, it's only $7.75 regardless of how many toppings you choose.",131,4
Food was very well cooked but service was far from good. We were just a party of three and the server charged automatically the tip to my card: when we asked he said he was doing that because most of their foreign customers don't tip so he had to teach them. He was being very rude and felt offended when I told him the tip amount was up to the client to decide.,80,2
"I actually never was able to try the food here. I got so pissed at the girl taking my order that I left. What happened? Well listen to this...I decided on a sandwich..I am not sure of the name , but it had roast beef and some sort of yummy cheese and the other sandwich stuff they add to it. Well I am not a fan of veggies, i know, that's so childish, but it is what it is. Anyway, I tell the girl what I want and I let her know I want the roast beef sandwich with only cheese and mayo, no veggies. She then looks very puzzled...\"" you just want cheese and mayo on bread\""? I said no....I want the roast beef with just cheese and mayo. She then says that it does not make any sense....\""so you don't want the meat\""? I then ask her...why would I order \""roast beef\"" and then not want the meat? She is like well I dont know you are the one that ordered it that way. Im like are you serious right now???? She then says ...well if you are not gonna order can you step aside so I can take the next order. What ????!!!!! I ask to speak to the manager...who apparently is the girl that has been standing next to her the whole time and did not seem to think there was a problem at all. \n\nI was so outta there...I am sure the food is yummy..but it is such a shame to not only have an employee that responds this way...but to have a person in charge thinking it was normal.",332,0
Finally a good empanada place ;)\nFavorites so far are the El capitan and jalape\u00f1o popper with ham. Also tried the Cubano and buffalo chicken along with the chicken with mushroom ;)\nThe restaurant is small but friendly hipster type of place. They have a great beer selection.,67,3
"This place is trash. The guy at the door called me fat (uhh what, 110 pounds is fat? LOL okay). Then the short ugly manager wouldn't listen to me when I complained. He also told my friend she could pee outside when she said she had to use the bathroom.  Yeahhh ... Don't recommend.",72,0
"Usually I try restaurants based off yelp, but thought I would give them a shot. The place looked nice on the outside and inside. They have a large menu selection. Our server was Chris. We arrived before the dinner rush, the place was pretty empty.  I ordered the coconut shrimp with the grilled zucchini the mac and cheese. My meal was good. My cousin's chicken sandwich was tasteless. Our server was nice and took it off the bill and offered to get my cousin another item off the menu. We were all done with our meal so my cousin just got another beer. I thought service between our apps and main course was slow. The price of the food is a little high for what it is.",146,1
Best Chinese food I've had in nc since moving from NYC. I can at least eat it without saying omg I just wasted money,28,3
I gave it three stars ONLY because it was tough to understand where to go. Its a call center and I kept seeing people flash badges to get in so it confused me and I didn't know where to go. Finally after driving around I found three small spots labeled guests parking. Service was good and repair looks great though!,67,2

"Great place - much friendlier than the Yellow Jersey Ltd shop on State Street who were swearing in front of young children last time I was in and think they are better than everyone cause of their \""extensive\"" bike knowledge (even though they spend all their time in a bike shop)\n\nI just recently fixed up my Dad's old bike. Every time I have been in the store they have been nothing but honest with me when they could have taken advantage left and right as I am a complete cycling novice.

"Are u freaking kidding me?! This place is horrible! I am down to eat a delicious 5 thousand calorie burger any day, but not if it tastes like crap!

"I just have to start this review with a two-word sum-up... Not Impressed...\n\nWe were out and about & decided to try Lush due to finding a coupon/flier on our car window. Walked in & immediately overwhelmed by corniness of the decor. We requested to sit outside since it was just a lovely afternoon & it looked like they NEVER clean the seats (they were the cloth ones like by the pool or at a lounge bar). \n\nWe ordered the veggie sticks w/ ranch dipping sauce, the emulsion burger (him), and the veggie \""inside out\"" burger (me). This place was over priced and plain... The menu is also not very descriptive. When I ordered the veggie sticks I assumed they would somehow be special. When they set down a plate of sliced jimaca , carrots, & celery I was a little disappointed. Then I thought \""oh! Maybe the ranch dipping sauce is what's special\""... Not in the slightest... It just tasted like plain old Kraft ranch. \""Ranch Dipping Sauce\"" my butt...\n\nThen the burgers came out. He said the emulsion burger was not special at all and, in fact, very bland. If they intended you to actually be able to pick up the inside out veggie burger, they were kidding themselves... It came wrapped in paper to help it hold together, but the quinoa-squash patties crumbled immediately. It was a mess to eat, I just wound up using my fork and knife for the whole thing... And it was also very bland. It tasted like the veggies in the burger were doused in italian vinaigrette. I think if they made one thick patty and put it in a bun w/ an actual good sauce instead of Kraft italian dressing, it would be gold. \n\nLike I said. Not impressed... DEFINITELY not good enough to charge what they charge. We had the above plus I had wine (very good Chardonnay, btw) and he had a Heifewisen and it still came out to $40 bucks...\n\nThank God we had a buy one, get one free coupon... I doubt we'll go back.",448,1
"Teachers clearly have no or little schooling to be qualified to handle pre school children.   Maybe just this Tutor Time (I don't know) but this is the worst day care I have shamefully paid for. Credentials for these teachers are high school diplomas, and seems they dress up like clowns more often opposed to having a professional approach. Would not recommend this day care to anyone... Bright horizons is well worth the extra drive.",87,0
"I researched all the restaurants in the Venetian/Palazzo campus for this dinner because it was our anniversary dinner and I wanted to surprise my husband with a show (Jersey Boys - FAB!) and dinner. I settled on Zeffirino's because of their menu and the ability to sit at the balcony over the \""canal\"". \n\nRight off the bat, we were not happy with the hostess who seemed to be in conversation with 4 somewhat tipsy and loud ladies. We stood at the podium for a few minutes, not sure really WHO the hostess was until I called out into the room to ask if anyone was manning the post. The hostess broke away from the women and finally showed us how to get upstairs. \n\nThat being said, once we were upstairs, everything smoothed out. We were seated at the balcony where I had requested in the reservation, and we had two excellent wait staff working with us. There were a couple of mistakes made with my order, but they were so gracious and quick to correct that I wasn't even inclined to get huffy about it. The food was delicious, there were strolling musicians and as the place started to fill up, the atmosphere was one of warm family camraderie. We very much enjoyed our meal and our experience at this restaurant.",267,3
Don't go out of your way to get there because they probably won't be open. They were closed early the last two times I went there.,33,0
"I LOVE THIS SHOP! This location is absolutely amazing! I Got my dermals done by Diversity a few months ago, and I have been a repeat customer ever since! The customer service is highly energetic and positive with Bubbly young women with the knowledge of their products. Nick and Jason are great with Dermals, and Sam was amazing with my Nose piercing! They were quick to do my piercings and I am recommending the shop to all my friends. All the stuff people complain about with the no returns or exchanges, or not doing warranty on their products... HONESTLY why do people even think they should get free stuff after 2months of Chronic usage?! Plus! if its a good vaporizer IT HAS a MANUFACTURER WARRANTY! DUH! the fact that some people have given this place a bad review is completely based upon greed and selfishness, and to call someone a bad name when they are trying to help is just plain bad Karma.... Anyways, this place is by Far ones of the best places to get Tattoos and Piercings! the Artist are very positive and personable and have an energy I have never seen at any other shop.",229,4
"Skip this club and go to XS.\n\nI've been to Marquee Nightclub 3 times, but never to the Dayclub so this review doesn't apply to the latter. \n\nIt seems like the whole night, the play the same song over and over.  Dont get me wrong, I love house and trance.  But it needs to evolve throughout the night! XS is better because they mix familiar pop/top40 songs into the house which gets people dancing more.\nBut thats not even my biggest complaint.\n\nAfter hours and hours of wearing heals and dancing until my feet want to explode, and all i want to do is go back to the hotel, relax my feet and feet and eat pizza... THEY MAKE YOU WALK DOWN FOUR FLIGHTS OF STAIRS TO EXIT! wtf!\n\nEvery time I go back to the club, I think to my myself \""hey, its not so bad here... why did I hate it so much?\"" and then I'm confronted with the stairs again and remember.  I'm not out of shape or anything... I just like wearing cute heals!  sigh.",241,0
"My husband and I had lunch at Sugar Factory Dec. 30 at 11:30am after our plane arrived and we checked in at our hotel.  So it was a perfect time to let our hair down and start the fun.  We usually head to Mon Ami but wanted to try this place.  We asked for a seat out in the patio to people watch.\n\nDrink ordered: Goblet gummy bear.  They can be shared.\n\nPlates ordered: Salmon with asparagus-fair\nAnd Bacon Blue Cheese Burger-fair\n\nOur server was nice. \n\nHere is why they get the 1 star. The burger came with a long hair on the bun.  Our server was very apologetic and immediately returned the plate which was awesome! But never once did the manager approach us to apologize for the lack of detail and unsatisfactory presentation. I'm sure they have a front and back of the restaurant manager, someone could have acknowledged this mistake beside the waitress and honestly comped the burger. It had a hair!   While we waited for the burger we both shared the Salmon.  \n\nMaybe a manager didn't feel the need to come out because we had a Groupon.  But really the Groupon was for $20=$40 and that meal was a lot more than that.",283,0
"There are crazy options in Las Vegas for steak lovers such as myself. If that weren't the case, Fleming's might be a 5-star, favorite steakhouse of mine. It's still close and that counts for something. At the moment, they are running a $25 off promo for purchases $50 or more, as long as you make an online reservation. This expires in January I believe. I love the customer service here, as well as the close proximity to my house. The hostess was great, as well as the server and the awesome guy who brings out the food. He literally balanced at least 8 or 9 plates on one arm while bringing food out to a different table. I gotta thank Rob for suggesting this place, and for knowing about the crazy good deal going on.\n\nAs per the server Britney's suggestion, I ordered a $42 Medium Plus (apparently that's a thing) bone out Rib-Eye. It was pretty massive and very juicy. It was pretty much cooked to perfection, with a nice char on the outside. I am weening myself off more cooked steaks, it's not easy to do when you grow up on leathery well-done steaks (thanks Dad :P). I thought I loved my steaks well done, but chose to force myself to cook and order them medium well for a while now, for added juiciness and flavor. Now I might be on a Medium Plus kick for a while. I will never be at the point that Rob's at, ordering his filet Medium Rare. Yikes. But I tried a slightly more cooked piece of his filet, on the outer edge. It was delicious. I really like their parmesan bread, I can't say the same thing for their weird spreads that come with it. I wasn't a fan. I also tried one of the complimentary sauces they offer. It was the peppercorn, and it was delicious. \n\nOnce I dropped a subtle hint that we were celebrating Rob's B-day, they brought out a massive delicious piece of chocolate cake. It was a little rich, but that was mostly just the icing. \n\nWith the current promo, Fleming's is a no brainer. After January, I'm not 100% sure I'll be back on any kind of regular basis. It's basically the same price as the slightly better quality steakhouses. And there are way too many steakhouses here that I haven't yet tried. But we'll see, the customer service was outstanding, and it's really close and convenient. Oh and I'm gonna upload a few pics as well. I just want to note that I'm proud of myself for restraining from using any meat puns in this review. A pun-less review from me is pretty rare..... Oh, Dammit!",599,3
"Let me start by saying that there are a lot of chairs. This is the sole reason for a four star review instead of a five star review. They were slightly too tall and a shorter person may not have been able to have their feet touch the floor. I am not short, and my feet firmly touched the floor, but I worry for my short friends and family who may have their legs dangling while they eat. This could be quite a displeasure. What I do like about the chairs is that you can use the posts for a temporary cup holster in an emergency situation. Very handy! The padding on the chairs are mediocre at best and left my buttocks slightly asleep during and shortly after my meal. Along with these minor grievances the chairs are too heavy for the average human, which leads me to believe these chairs quite possibly weren't made for human beings. Just a thought. All in all, good food. Horrible chairs. Great atmosphere.\n\n(P.S. The booths looks more comfortable)",205,3
"Ate here on 4/26 with a group. The food was very good however, I have had way better. I dont mind paying but this was not worth the price IMO. Was it good, yes, was it awesome, not really. I would have preferred Ruth Chris. \n\nI also thought the service was subpar. There were many instances where drinks were empty. Servers would take the empty glass then not offer another drink. Our party probably would have spent another couple hundred if the server asked us if we cared for another beverage.",114,1
"I really wanted to like this place more than I did. I love that is it like a classic WI supper club- complete with pickled eggs and pork hocks. We sat at the bar, and although the service was friendly, I felt it was really slow- it took a very long time for them to initially acknowledge us or for us to receive our food or be checked on, but at least they nice!\n\nThey do beer flights for $1/beer sample in increments of 4, 8, or 12- what a good deal! And you can choose any of their over 40 beers on tap. Of course we ordered the cheese curds, which were greasy and delicious. Otherwise I was kind of disappointed in the food. I ordered the Wurst platter, two of my sausages were under cooked, and they all were just overall bland. My boyfriend ordered the chili cheese dog- the hot dog was very good, but the chili was the worst chili I have ever had- literally no seasoning at all (and I have very low chili standards) There was also barely any cheese on it at all. I think that maybe they were just having an off day, or we just ordered the wrong items of the menu, but based off their food alone I would not come back. \n\nA great place to try some WI beers and cheese curds, but maybe go elsewhere to eat.",289,2
"Just came back from lunch at Betty's Nosh. Here is the scoop: Ambience is exceptional. Bordering on new American & Nouveau European. Nice upscale decor and extremely clean. The owners were all there which is a plus. Location does not fit the place but a gem is a gem regardless of location. Food was very very good. Higher quality everything prepared with skill and knowledge. Price point is fair for the quality of food. $55.00  including gratuity for lunch for wife and I. Go for the uniqueness, food, ambience and the fact that it is not a chain.",125,3
"I came here to try out the usr/lib workspace upstairs, but never left the ground floor. This is a great coffeehouse, and not in a Vegas way - I'm disappointed that it can't be my local hangout.\n\nThe wifi is as strong as the coffee, and my lunch was modestly-portioned but tasted great. The local coffeehouse crowd was nifty, too, and if I wanted to get back into the neon side of Vegas, the Fremont St Experience was just a block or two away. Next time I'm in town and need somewhere to work, this is where I'll go.",130,4
"Visisted this restaurant with my family recently.  I lived many years in Mexico so I know what the cusine should be like.  This restaurant is fairly authentic and has many things you don't find in other Mexican restaurants.\n\nFor the most part, their food is very good.  Of all the things we had, the only thing we didn't like was their \""Spanish\"" rice.  It has an odd flavor because it is spiced with cumin.  Cumin is not used in Mexican cuisine (or if it is, it must be very rare).\n\nThe better dishes, like Lamb Adobo, are pricier than the usual snack-type meals like tacos but are worth it.  They don't provide complementary chips.  They have them but you have to pay for them (welcome to Scottsdale).  Their salsas have out of the ordinary flavors but are good.  They run mild.  So if you want decent heat, ask for their Habanero sauce.  They have Tecate beer, but not on tap :-(   Margaritas are good.  Their limeade is homemade and good.\n\nTheir desserts are delicious.  We had flan and a Mexican chocolate creme pie.\n\nThe service is very authentic.  This means that if you expect American service, you will be disappointed.  Mexican service is deliberately slow and waiters must be summoned for service.  It's a cultural thing.  People are expected to take a long time at meals, eating slowly to enjoy their meal and enjoying each other's company.  If you are in a hurry, this is not the place to go.  If you can handle this type of service, the food is worth the bother.",360,3
"I tried this Detroit style \""pizza\"" last night.  I can only say that I hated it with all my pizza loving heart.  The service was served up begrudgingly since they where more interested in cleaning so they could get out of there early.  We arrived 1 hour before they were to close to find all but the chairs already on the tables.  We ordered the largest special with two drinks and it came to a little over thirty bucks. The employee's were talking with a gross off duty employee loudly just a few feet from us about how one of them hated that he had to work tomorrow and some other lame topics we tried our best to ignore. and he filled his giant cup full of soda.  Finally he left and the other employee went back to cleaning all around us.  It was very uncomfortable and awkward since her cleaning was the only noise in the place.  The TV's were muted and the background music was real low.  Finally the pizza arrived, but I thought they had the order wrong, because I didn't order a $4 frozen Tino's pizza.  This piece of trash they believe to be pizza must be for poor Detroit trailer trash.  I can't believe anyone would eat crap like that.   I totally agree with the other posters who've stated that the toppings taste and look like they came straight out of a bag.  I've had better pizza in high school cafeterias back in the 80's.  This place was a fail on every possible level for me.  I'm going to keep trying what Vegas has to offer till I find a pizza I can eat without crying.",343,0

"Friend and I stopped here for lunch at the Fashion Show and were pleasantly surprised by the vegan and vegetarian options.  She ordered the chicken provolone sandwich (vegan style) and I chose the chicken spinach wrap (regular, no changes).  I was a little disappointed with my wrap, as it was on the bland side....I hoped for a bit more flavour, especially since it came with a pesto mayo, but nope.  However, the amount of spinach that came with the wrap (and in the actual tortilla) should do me for the next year or so!  We were too full to try a cookie or cake, but will shoot for that next time.  Service was very friendly.\n\nI liked the location of this Red Velvet as it was tucked under the elevator.    Kind of made it seem like it was in a different world than the rest of the bustling mall.  :)",184,2

"When I hear, amazing, the best, fresh, tasty...etc I am expecting really great things. \n\nI ordered garlic naan, samosa and channa masala.\nNaan was hard by the time I got home. Garlic was sprinkled on so either this thing was microwaved or made first and sat out. \n The channa masala was so dry, there was no gravy whatsoever. When I opened it, it smelled very good however it was too dry to eat. The picture is not the same. \n\nLastly the samosa was definitely microwaved...it was cold within a minute of bringing it home. \n\nPeople may say that I should have eaten there however I have ordered takeout from many places before, this isn't my first time eating indian food.",167,1

"I have looked forward to eat at this place ever since I moved to Gilbert. I finally had the opportunity and frankly I should have gone to chipotle. They do not cook in house, the food is salty and over priced. In short, it is a chipotle, serving tequila and better decor...save your money",65,1
"Peach Festival 2012: Do not expect big plump peaches. The variety grown at this farm are small desert peaches. As of mid-May 2012, the majority of peaches were not yet tree ripened. If you hand pick, take time to search the orchard and find a tree with good fruit.\n\nFootwear recommendation... if you do the UPICK, wear something you don't care gets dirty... the peach orchard ground is unlevel dirt and patches of mud, so wearing nice footwear or flip flops is not recommended.\n\nThe peach pancake breakfast served on-site was generous with the pancakes, but stingy on the peach topping. The peaches used in the topping were unripe, somewhat crunchy, and required a sprinkling of sugar. Expect to stand in a long slow line for your serving.\n\nFree admission and parking, but higher prices for many of the peach related products and other items sold at this festival.",199,1

"Disappointing.  I know the location is in a hotel, but still, I expected better.  The serious flaw is the reflection off of the exhibit glass.  You cant enjoy the fish and other creatures because of the distracting glare from the various light sources.

Overall, the aquarium is very small and it did not take much time at all to go through.",102,1

"We visited on a weeknight. The place was full of patrons but we were seated right away. The staff was very welcoming and I will say right away that the service was excellent. There were 2 young kids in our group and they fit right in, the place was very kid friendly. \n\nWe wanted so much to love the food and start being one of the regulars like in the other Yelp reviews. They Garlic knots were good to much on while waiting for our main course. We enjoyed their Fried Calamari the most, great flavor and really crunchy. I got the House Special pizza (their version of meats lovers) which was good and was very reasonably priced. My wife loves seafood and always gravitates towards clams if available. She got the Linguini with white clam sauce, unfortunately this is the main reason I'm giving 3 stars. The sauce was really off in flavor, just garlicky and didn't seem fresh. Tried several bites to see if it will grow on me but it didn't. \n\nWe also like a good tiramisu to cap our Italian meal but we got served a plastic tub full of just mascarpone cream, not enough coffee flavor and no lady fingers. \n\nNot sure we'll try this place again. Maybe we just didn't order the best they have to offer.",276,2
"As indicated in my previous review this place wasn't high on my list to return to, but we were going right by there and I've never had an issue with the food, so why not.  Well, yet again, the table was sticky.  We watched our server and the owner push two dirty tables together for an 8-top, remove all the dirty plates, glasses, etc, and not wipe the table down.  Then, after the couple next to me left, the server cleaned off the dirty dishes and gave a cursory wipe of one corner with a rag.  The owner comes along to seat the next guests, notices the water ring on the table, wipes his right hand through it, and then spins to shake the hand of the next guest.  \n\nI'm in the dirty table Twilight Zone.\n\nAnd this time because our server was busy bussing tables, our food came out lukewarm, and Mr. M's yolks were cool and had solidified under the heat lamp.  \n\nHire.  Some.  Bussers.   \n\nI want to like this place, but now I know the tables are a petri dish.  Good luck.  I will not be back again.",261,0

Bought  a groupon and came late in the afternoon to try it out.  Service was average.  Food was about twice the price that it should be.   The place claims that they have great steaks but there weren't any on the lunch menu.  I had the ribs and they were fair although tony romas would have been better at about a third the price.  The beer was cold and the decor was nice.  The prices were way too high to consider coming back for an average meal.,105,1

The music, well idk but there was nobody worth dancing with. \n\nThere were a few people who ordered bottle service, 30 minutes later VIP was empty; I guess they said forget this even after paying several hundred dollars for bottle service.I stayed all of 45 minutes which was too long.  \n\nI went back to the Wynn so pissed and disgusted I was going straight to bed. On my way up I saw the most beautiful, well dressed people staggering out of Surrender by the dozens. I was just standing there with my jaw open like WTF! I should have played in my own yard.  I started to go there first but it had some negative reviews on yelp so i didn't want to chance it. My Fellow yelpers let me down big time :(",242,0
"I was going to be a first time customer at this salon, made my appointment online but it was not accepted and I had to call to reschedule. I didn't catch her name maybe it was Christina? I'm not sure but when someone finally talked to me, I told her I wanted a mani and an acrylic full set then she asked if I wanted regular or gel and I asked what was the difference? The way she answered was as if I was dumb she said \""its regular or gel I need to know which one want? Ones where you buy at the store.\"" Like seriously?? All you had to do was answer the question doesn't matter if you think its dumb or not. After that I just said \""nevermind, your being rude\"" and just hung up. I don't want to go somewhere where people talk to you on the phone like that. I was really excited to go and get my nails done by you guys but that just threw me off.",200,0
"Inoffensive sushi. Nothing too exciting, but not bad. Hamachi roll was nice, but some of the fancy rolls feel like they are trying too hard.",33,2
"This was my fourth visit to Carmi's and I have to say after the horrible service, wait for our food, and attitude from our waitress I will never go back. Like others have posted on UrbanSpoon, Google reviews, and Facebook, the silverware, cups, and dishes are filthy. When we arrived there were two 2-seat booths filled and one table of two. We placed our order for the fried chicken and the other tables vacated but another 2-person booth was filled behind us and then a larger booth with 4 people both of which ordered them same meals as us. In fact, the 2-person booth behind us order EXACTLY the same as us and we laughed but that laughter stopped when their food came out immediately and they were out the door before our meals even arrived. Our waitress was downright rude to us as well. When our order finally came, only my cousin's chicken dinner arrived and the waitress who brought out our meals (not our original) looked at me like I had two heads when I asked where mine was. So then we had to wait for my meal to come out. We also order ONE dish to go and they gave us TWO of those without the accompanying side dish (we decided it wasn't worth fighting over it to get it taken off and knew that we would just each take our own home instead), anyhow, when I asked about the accompanying side to go with it, our original waitress shot me a dirty look, rolled her eyes and acted like I was inconveniencing HER! Never again. As I saw one reviewer state on a FB review - your customers ARE what will keep you in business but you won't have any if you treat them like they are not welcome",351,1
"The worst pizza I've ever had. It makes Totino's taste gourmet.\n\nIt was soggy and just tasted terrible. We also got the combo appetizer. With the exception of the fried zucchini, everything was bland and hub says the mozzarella sticks were reheated.\n\nOh and on the vegetarian pizza I said twice, no peppers. Guess what was all soggy and gross on my pizza? Peppers!\n\nAnd this place came highly recommended - we stayed with a friend while in Vegas last weekend.",108,0
Food was OK at best. Portions were small and overpriced.,13,1
"Have you ever wished you were morbidly obese? You would if you went here. If you are over 350 pounds (no lying, they weigh you in the middle of the restaurant) then you eat for free. \n\nYou walk in and are greeted by a hot girl dressed as a nurse. Every guy's dream right? And then said nurse helps you into a hospital gown, which you are required to wear throughout your meal.\n\nThey have burgers, fries, shakes, and liquor. That is all. If you are expecting more, you will be disappointed. Everything is calorie-filled and tasty, and you won't leave hungry. The shakes have a pad of butter on top and are around 2000 calories.\n\nThey only take cash but have an ATM in the restaurant with a small 75 cent service fee.\n\nIf you don't get a heart attack from eating their food, you will definitely get one from looking at the waitresses.\n\nThis is definitely a fun place to go if you are in town, but I definitely wouldn't come here on a regular basis, unless I wanted to gain a bazillion pounds.",251,3
"I am conflicted on how to rate Honey Pig. I liked the quality of the meat and the fact that they basically cook everything for you. What I am not a huge fan of is how understaffed they are, the upcharge on items without notice, the lack of kalbi during lunch, and the limitation of it on dinner. \n\nWe rolled in as a large party of 10 and sat in the back. It took some time for the lady to get to us and start the grill. Half our party was eating while the rest of us were waiting to start. When we began, we were happy with the food for the most part. The meat could have used some seasoning if the sesame oil dipping sauce was not to come with salt. The marinated meat just tasted too sweet.\n\nOnce we got started, the attendant started to loosen up. We didn't eat that much and asked for the bill halfway through. It threw her off and she kept offering to bring out more food if we needed. Overall, she was rather nice, but we all had to get to work or do errands. Honey Pig was decent, but I have other places I would go first if the need for Korean BBQ hits.",252,1
"Well we just came back from our first visit to Liliana's. First off, our request for Outdoor Dining actually ended up seating us inside. Our request for preferred \""quiet\"" seating was not taken into consideration. Next, after we ordered dinner we waited for over 55 minutes for our food (table of 7). My wife's second glass of wine was not the same as the first glass, however our waiter did replace it but not until he sniffed it at the table, second guessing us. When our food finally arrived it was obvious it sat under heating lamps, my order of Creole Trio showed obvious signs being congealed and my daughter's Creole Bouillabaisse, my wife's Pasta Liliana showed over dryness especially to all items on top.\n \nWhat a disappointment.",166,0
"Even for the price I paid, which was $5, this place is still not worth eating at. It was like they unpackaged a crap load of frozen food and dumped it in warming trays. Don't eat here. Go eat Del Taco instead.",53,0
The chick at the daiquiri counter was awesome! She recommended a mix of the coral crush & pi\u00f1a colada to make a dreamsicle! Very good!,40,4
Bartender's are great very freindly small plates good but make sure you try their in house home made cellos,26,3
"The positives: prime rib, kalbi, ox tail soup, wine & beer included in the price.\n\nThe negatives:  all the seafood tasted old.  The crawfish tasted especially bad.\n\nOverall, I would not come back even for the price they are offering for this buffet.",64,1
"I boarded my dog here for 2 nights and I am very happy with the experience.  All of the staff is friendly and interested in the dogs.  I had only scheduled one night, and our plans changed.  I called on the morning I was supposed to pick my dog up and asked if I could leave her a second night and they said that was fine.  It really opens up some spontaneity for me.  Also, I asked how my dog did the first night, and they said she did great, and based on their comments, it was obvious to me that they had checked in on my dog.\n\nThe dogs are kept in separate, large cages.  There was enough room that I was able to bring a travel crate and my dog's bed.  This worked well for my dog.  Lots of kennels that i checked out in the area have the dogs spend hours together in a playtime area.  But you never know how well the dogs will be supervised.  I liked that this place is not set up that way, my dog likes to feel safe in her own space.  That may not work for others, but it is a great setup for my dog.\n\nThey are up front with their prices and drop off/pick up times, so there were no surprises.  And their rates are very reasonable.  I will definitely use them again, and suggest them to my dog owner friends.",295,4
Very disappointed with the food quality. Grilled Onions and mushrooms were not cooked. Burger was dripping oil. I cant believe this is being served to people.,31,0
"Crowded, mashups, girls all wearing the same clothes, horrible booze (like poison-you horrible), $12 drinks, $450 bottles. Not my scene but the club was pretty/well appointed. Many floors. Might be someone else's idea of a fun night, but it definitely wasn't mine.",69,1
"The interior of Gold Bar looks like a hip, arty 75 year old woman's living room. The coffee is good (Allann Bros.) but pricey. Really pricey. But that may have something to do with its being located directly across the parking lot from a very busy Starbucks.\n\nIf you're in the area, it's a comfortable \""let's chat\"" kind of place.",86,2
Worst bar ever! You should consider yourself lucky to be served a drink when the place is barely even busy. The drafts are way over priced and taste horrible because they do not maintain the lines. I had a pale ale that tasted like apples because there was a cider on the line before. They have to have a yeast monster in there somewhere because last time I had 2 beer and woke up hung over. Avoid at all costs unless they have live music.,93,0
"So, I love Indian food.  I like Copper.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe dishes we tasted were delicate and well-seasoned.  The naan was traditional but also excellent, served to us relentless and continually by the best \""bread boy\"" I've ever had.  Seriously - he was amazing.  I also had a great glass of wine.\n\nThe \""meh\"":\n\nI'd really like to be able to try their Indian-influenced dishes, which comprise the largest portion of their menu, but the vegetarian dishes are limited to their traditional menu.  This is fine but disappointing.  Although I enjoyed my meal very much, I thought it was significantly overpriced for what I had.",154,2
"What can I say about Oscar's? The staff is super friendly, and very attentive. I ordered the 12oz Filet. Medium rare. I paired with a glass of Pinot noir and several sides. We were a group of 6, and the special attention we each got was amazing. Being the only guy in the group, I didn't mind being asked my order last. The service, and food made up for it. Located in what used to be Firefly inside the Plaza Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas, I definitely say check it out. The prices are very fair for the hunk of Filet I got. I would definitely go back again!",137,4
"If I could give this place a negative that's what I would give. Their security are a bunch of discriminating people. My party of 10 had bottle service, as we were getting ready to go in the bouncer stopped me and said this is not you but it's a real ID. I'm 26 and one of the oldest people in my party. Why would I really try to get a fake ID and risk getting caught. I've been to Vegas 3 times this year and no issues. Been going to the BIGGER name clubs and getting in without any issues. But this place. It was dead and slow so you would think they would want all the people they could get. Even from the strip you couldn't hear the music. Pretty weak. \n\nAdvice: if you're thinking of going here...DONT. Go else where for cheaper and have way more fun and not feel like your at your parents house with all the rules.",203,0
"Will not be my go to place for buying make up. Staff is pretty stiff, snooty, and not friendly. Make up is unkept, dust everywhere. No one bothers to help you. Not one person out of the 7 people working did anyone greet me. Should have walked out on the spot. I'll continue shopping at Nordstrom.",72,1
"Myself and the group I went with really liked this show!!  Of course the boobs made it great.  The main singer was really good. She did a great job interacting with the crowd.  And the comedian was hilarious, I think he may have been my favorite part!!  The venue is pretty small so I don't think there is really a bad seat.  We sat in the middle and could see very well.",88,3
"LOVE MICHAEL and TONY.  My husband had Tony, so I cannot speak directly, however, Michael is outstanding. He is talented, gifted, and hilarious. The quality is exceptional and I would say that his calling is taking stressed, high pressured, over-worked, non-intentional asshole folk and transforming, even if only for 80 minutes, to a peaceful, child-like existence. Thank you Michael. TOPPER....reasonably priced. GO,",95,4

"It's pretty rare I get excited about food. I'll eat it, I'll assess it, I'll write a Yelp review. But rare that I get an emotional reaction from it. This Saturday that all changed!\n\nMy girlfriends and I went here - one of whom had already been and was talking it up; she was right because It did NOT disappoint!\n\nI was revealed that the atmosphere was chill, laid back, friendly, and welcoming. Not like the stuffy sushi places closer to the strip. Our server, Charles, was friendly, funny , and prompt with our orders. There was a lot of confusion and talk about what to order. He quickly stepped in and made the suggestion that the chef could present some cold and warm dishes at his recommendation until we were full. Sold!!!\n\nSince I can't find the menu online, I'm going to recall the dishes as best I can:\n\nYellowtail Yuzu Soy - Texture like butter. So fresh, you wouldn't think it was fish. Love the tempura jalapeno on top. \n\nGyoza - I HAVE to get gyoza at sushi time. Love this gyoza. Beef was fresh and moist. Not dried out and greasy. Very well done! \n\nMussels: I can't believe more people that wrote reviews didn't try this dish. Don't be afraid people!!!! These were incredible\n\nLive soft shell crab - not actually live, but very very fresh. Crab was fried served over a bed of fancy salad (\""fancy\"" meaning it wasn't just crappy iceberg lettuce). The sauce that came on the dish with this was incredible. Spicy but not too spicy. This one had a perfectly balanced textures and flavors. \n\nSalmon Sashimi - It had pop rocks on it!!!!! So weird, but really amazing. \n\nI wish I could remember everything we ate. The servers were great. They kept checking on our appetite level. He wasn't pushy about desert or drinks, which was nice. The price for all of us was incredibly reasonable considering the quality of the food. We walked away paying about $45/person. I consider that a steal for this place.\n\nI had such a great experience here. I have been blabbing about it to everyone. I CANNOT wait to come back and try some new things.",506,4
"Staff seated us (family of five) promptly, service was great and food was excellent.",19,3
"I'm usually a big fan of Barriques, but this location has one problem that is the reason for the two-star rating and why I won't go back. The coffee shop doesn't ventilate properly, so I leave the shop smelling like smoky bacon and have to change my clothes and shower so I can bear myself. I really hope this gets fixed so I can return, but for now I'll go to their other locations.",93,1
"I've been in Art Mart several times over the past few years, but I've just recently come to really love the place. They have a fantastic assortment of home goods, cooking and imported food products, but what I really enjoy is their bakery and cheese selection. Their pastries are fantastic, and they have Intelligentsia coffee, which is pretty delicious. Their cheese selection is very unique, and you'd be hard pressed to find most of the cheeses elsewhere in town. While some items throughout the store can be a bit pricey, nothing is outrageous, and the food is generally reasonably priced. \n\nAs for customer service, in my experience, everyone has been super friendly. I've always felt welcome when browsing through the store.\n\nIf you haven't been to Art Mart, definitely check it out!",170,4
"So maybe it's just because my expectations were too high, but I was a little disappointed by O Face Doughnuts.\n\nI was kind of expecting something the caliber of Voodoo Donuts in Portland and this place just isn't at that level. They do have some creative flavors using Captain Crunch cereal, bacon and other creative yumminess, but they just weren't the taste sensation I was expecting.\n\nThis is basically somewhere between a regular donut shop and Voodoo Donuts. I think they are new, so hopefully in time they will achieve the Voodoo Donuts level of awesomeness, but for the moment they are just a nice effort that falls short.",136,2
"3 times i've tried to use Irene's and 3 times she's refused to do the work.  First, she wouldn't shorten sleeves on a wool blazer because it was 'too old.'  (~5 years)  Next, she wouldn't lengthen sleeves on another wool jacket because she said she would have to 'move the buttons.'  And today, when i took in some causal pants i wanted to have old pockets replaced, she wanted to do a quicky re-stitch--something even i could have done myself--and i wanted her to use new material.  She wouldn't do it, saying that making new pockets would be 'too time-consuming.'  Maybe it's me.  Maybe she doesn't like my looks or something, but gad, how does this woman stay in business if she turns down work??",178,0
"We were in the mood for burgers, thought we'd give 'em a try here. After all, their menu says something about them being Top 10 burgers from Phoenician Magazine or something. \n\nUm. No. Average burger. To the point that I almost wished that I had let my husband talk me into Whataburger. The medium rare had no pink, and the patty itself was boring. \n\nTheir French Fries were not good either. I had 2. My husband, who is a fries whore may have had 7.\n\nWe're calorie watchers, and both felt thus was a total waste of calories. \n\nDo yourself a favor and stick to the southwestern style if food on the menu. That's always good and never disappointed us!",168,2
"So we didn't stay here, but this review is based on my gambling and dining experience. First off, the giant pyramid is a must see, what a cool design! Inside looks immaculate! The casino floor is spotless and there are tons of tables and slots in this place. I played blackjack in what the Luxor calls the \""Party Pit\"". They have a female dancer dancing on stage in-between the circle of tables. Not distracting to me, but I can see how they're trying to pull attention from your cards... So... PAY ATTENTION so you don't lose $$$. \nMy wife and I ate at the Tacos & Tequila (T&T). Not bad, but overpriced for small portions. You definitely pay for the experience and not the food. All in all this place is really nice and I would come back!",172,3
"The crowd here SUCKS if you have any depth to your soul! The shallowness and snobbiness of the night time crowd here is unparallel to any other bar in Charlotte that I know of. That said - the staff is really really nice and the patio rocks! They typically have great live music in the summer time in the open air. The food is descent and the kitchen is quite accomodating. Parking is a bit limited but there are several bars on that street that you can visit within walking distance, as well as a bowling alley.  If you do descide to check it out make sure to say hey to Vita!",129,2
Had a great time.  It was a perfect summer night for beer. We ate on the patio - warm without bugs. Also a man spinning some tunes.   From Ohio and wanted to try Wisconsin beers.  The sampler was the way to go especially with cheese curds and beer bread.   My husband had the sausage plate - being German he never can resist - he like the favors.  I had the chicken pot pie - a little too thick but filling.  I think the prices were reasonable    We walked around the downtown for an enjoyable evening.,113,3
"This review is for the LV store in Cesars Forum. If I could give 0 stars I would. This went from DEFECTIVE  product to DAMAGED product in THEIR HANDS.  There is no accountability or sense of urgency. Not what you expect from a luxury goods company or for my 18 years of client loyalty. Everyone is nice when making their sale but what counts really is how they treat you when you have a issue.   This luxury line should stand for quality  on all levels starting with their employees. What prompt this long review is the lack in quality making this bag, their damaging of it during repair plus the poor customer service during entire process. \nThey still have my purse with no update. I want my purse back undamaged- new or same one.  I want to love this company because of my heavy investment.  I want to believe this will never happen again. \n\nMy story:\nPurchased a purse here summer  2013 because I wanted a light, small, hands free purse to use in Vegas. Now,  fast fwd to my recent vacation in July 2014 I walked back in to shop and to point out the fact that the gold hardware  is fading to silver. Now this Eva purse has only been used several time and owned less than 1 year.  When I packed for this trip I litterally grabbed the duster bag encasing this purse out of my closet into my luggage.  While wearing it there I noticed a discoloation on the loop where the strap attaches and the zipper pull. This tarnish is a defect in product. I own key chains from LV that are 10+ years old that has not tarnish to this degree. They agree that that should not had happened. So here's where my frustration begins:\n-  The sales associate name Ryo asked that I come back when his repair specialist Melissa is in. We were there on vacation, leaving the next day. So we rearrange our departure.\n- Melissa called and said to drop off the purse so she can send it off to repair. When we went in to drop off the purse she wasn't there. Another associate took the purse and handed me a receipt showing the take in and issue.\n- 4 days later ( I'm at work and back in Ca) I get a call from Ryo saying that Melissa wants to know when I was dropping off the purse. What??!\n- Melissa called, saying they found it. Saying that corporate is not willing to pay, but the store will \""eat the cost\"". Really? \n- 3 weeks later I get a call that repair is done and on its way to me.\n- I received my fedex box, open, inspect purse. The ring replacement took place but now the attaching leather is TORN!!!!! DID MELISSA NOT SEE THAT? My guess is this happened when they had to take the old ring off and add the new. Where was the quality inspection ?? \n- I called right away and spoke to a manager name Navid. He said he would email a shipping label next day and that he will take a look at it himself. \n- I had to call a few times the next day to finally get that email with label. I also replied back with my dissatisfaction.  Do you think I got a reply?  NOPE.\n- tracking shows the package was received at 9am so I called to speak to him at 6pm. He said he was waiting to speak to his store manager and that he would call me. This was Friday.\n- today is Tuesday. Still no call. \n- I am done dealing with that store. I just called their corporate now waiting on update.\n\nThis entire experience is horrible.  Usually my shopping experience is pleasant with any LV store in both CA and NV.  Then again this really is the first time I've had an issue and I now  learned this is how I get treated.  At first my thought was I will stick to my Bloomingdale's in South Coast, Ca. That this location is the bad apple.  I am anxious to see how this will all unravel.  Will update soon.",870,0
I'd call this a small version of the traditional 50's diner for breakfast and lunch. The portions are very large at the prices are low! The food is great and the staff is extremely friendly. \n\nBring a friend to share the ham and eggs!,59,3
"Less than a mile from our house, sometimes my wife and I like to have weekend date nights at DeBlasio's.\n\nOur first time there, about six years ago, we unknowingly sat next to Marc-Andre Fleury and his date. This was long before I knew who he was or even cared about hockey, and I think our waiter was amused by how star struck we weren't.\n\nIt's a little dressier than a lot of places around here, where blue jeans and Steelers jerseys are a year-round affliction for the local bros ... and some women.\n\nOur most recent trip was Valentine's Day 2014, and we've spent other occasions there as well. New Year's Eve a few years ago with a group of about 10 friends stands out, for example. \n\nThe food and service at DeBlasio's are both better than most of the Italian restaurants I've tried between NE Ohio and SW Pennsylvania. The decor makes me nostalgic for my grandparents house in Youngstown during the late 70s or early 80s, and the dining rooms are always kept clean, even on busy Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nThing is, for occasions like Valentines Day and New Year's Eve, the menu is (understandably, but disappointingly) limited. This helps the kitchen and waitstaff keep turning tables over -- I get it -- but DeBlasio's regular menu features a much greater variety of excellent fare.\n\nSomething I always try to order is the greens & beans with hot sausage appetizer. I can't really overstate how much I love it. I also recommend checking the board on the way in, because the daily features are often home to my favorites, like the Osso Bucco.\n\nI'd really like to go on a weeknight sometime soon, maybe try a few different glasses of wine. Maybe get a steak. Buon appetito!",412,3
"Nice cozy place, great service. Food comes out fast and is consistently delicious. Would definitely recommend. My favorite is the bacon wrapped dates and the sangria by far.",35,3
"Ok, so we knew the chef and he hooked us up with a huge sampling of the best of everything (no exaggeration!).  But I think that even if we paid full price, and only got to try a few of their appetizers and one Paella, I still would be giving Imagine Spain 5 stars.\n\nIt was really slow, and I felt sorry for the staff ... they seemed bored ... so all of you yelpers, go check out Imagine Spain.  It's delicious and more importantly, unique.  That's sometimes hard to find with the mass of cookie-cutter restaurants around here....",127,4
Good service and decor. Food sadly mediocre. A bit overpriced for the quality.\n\nWent here as we got a coupon for a free appetizer from the Omni hotel. All in all the food was decent but certainly nothing special. \n\nThe ambiance and decor are both great however.,61,2
"This place is a gem for the quality of the food and the facts profits go to the community.  The wait staff are volunteers and the place had a great vibe.  The night my GF and I were there a lawyer was serving us.  As for the food, excellent.  Braised lamb possibly the best I ever tasted $20.  Red lentil soup to start also very good, it was a bargain at around $4.  Key line and meringue tart to finish was also a total deal at around $5.  My GF said the Cesar salad with smoked trout was the best she ever had.\n\nTo summarize this review... meal for 2 was under $90 with a 20% tip including 1 glass of red wine at $9.  Any shortcomings are not worth mentioning; hence giving \""Robin hood\"" the full 5 stars.  Moreover, I will definitely go back when I return to beautiful Montreal.  This was the highlight dining experience of our trip to Montreal.",209,4
"On May 2, 2013 a group of friends and I came here to grab a burger before a movie.\n\nFour of us became incredibly ill only hours after eating here and we were all sick for 3-4 days afterward. Two of the other members who came with us did not get ill.\n\nApologies, I would have written something more timely, but just getting around to it now. I've eaten at other Red Robin's before and never had an issue. It appears it's just this location.",115,0
I guess I should have spoke up when my group decided we should try Cheeseburger while waiting for our show to start. I maybe eat 2 hamburgers a year and I don't eat cheese. I just figured there would still be a selection of other foods. Well I was wrong. There were about a gazillion hamburger choices and a handful of other entrees. I ended up going with a chicken ceaser which cost me a whopping $12 and I still left hungry. I guess people are willing to pay a lot more for less when they are caught up in the hustle and bustle of the vegas strip.,125,1
"Had to work in the city today so I needed a quick lunch before going to my next meeting. I've been to most of the restaurants at the Collier Center, but haven't been to this one in a long time. \n\nToday's special was Spaghetti and Meat Balls with bread stick and drink for $7. Not bad, the spaghetti was cooked \""al dente\"" and was accompanied by three meat balls topped with meat sauce ( I think) it which was watered down. I don't like my spaghetti swimming in sauce but this was almost dry (watered sauce was at the bottom of the dish, It was HOT and the meatballs, flavorful. The bread stick was OK. So, If you want something quick and filling, this wasn't bad.",160,2

The salted chocolate cookies are the most fabulous things I have ever had. I could eat them everyday! They have tammy coe cakes which are jst as beautiful as they taste.  I love their french pancakes they ate sweetened with honey and strawberries and topped with creme fraiche delicious!!!!!! When I step into this place its like going to a french cafe.  I used to live there so I remember what those places were like.  I live a block away so I go a couple times a week its just fabulous!!!! The wine selection there is wonderful...the staff is friendly.  Its nice because they have curbside pick up if you want to enjoy your goodies at home...you can also stay and enjoy at nice little table inside or on their cute patio.  Its nestled in the heart of arcadia you cannot get much better!!! Try it you will become addicted!!!,175,4
"I really don't know why this place is getting 5's. I'm really reluctant to give out too many 5's because a 5 star to me is TOP NOTCH stuff. This place is super hyped. There's nothing really special about this place other than a few special rolls that don't pack much of a punch.\n\nSeaweed Salad: 3/5 They're seaweed salad is prepared a bit different taste the same though as most places. I think this place LOVES SAUCE. I HATE things being over sauced. Their seaweed salad came with a drizzle of a yellow sauce on top of it. It made no difference to the flavor. Tasted like a normal seaweed salad a little more watery than usual. \n\nTheir version of poke: 2/5 Wasn't impressed, I was very disappointed that they didn't have an Ahi poke every places has this. Instead they had a Spanish version of poke. It was like tuna with salsa on top of a chip.\n\nD.A. Roll: 1/5 I'm not much into deep fried rolls so this wasn't something I ordered. They mistakenly brought it to my table but since we had AYCE we didn't mind eating it. \n\nSashimi Roll: 4/5 The only special thing I kind of liked on the menu. I was blown away when yelpers said there was a sushi spot that made sashimi rolls. I had to try it. Basically its your assorted fish wrapped with a thin slice of radish. The radish adds an odd flavor to the sashimi that makes the roll a bit sour and yucky. \n\nNigiri: 4/5 Probably the only good thing about this place. The ratio of Fish to rice was just perfect 50/50. Yet we all know more fish than rice is what we really want. The fish was really fresh too. The salmon nigiri came with thin slices \n\nTuna carpaccio:0/5 EKK OVERLY SAUCED! The thin slices of tuna were super thin and it was drenched with sauces. The caramelized toasted garlic added an eerie flavor. The Tuna Carpaccio I absolutely hated it. \n\nBaked Green Mussel: 4/5 The Baked green mussels were delicious not as sweet as orders and it was cut into 3 pieces than your usual 2 pieces. Unfortunately its 1 order person which makes it limited. \n\nAYCE: 3/5 Is limited all you can eat is suppose to be ALL YOU CAN EAT but here it seems like more than 10 items are LIMITED to one order per person. I don't like that.. I hate limitations lol\n\nOverall Doubt I'll come here again, the sushi was eh okay wasn't amazing.",597,1
"Ann Taylor is where I usually purchase my professional attire. While they do tend to be a bit expensive for my budget, they often have sales and send email coupons which make their items more affordable. The store is well organized, bright, the dressing rooms are sizable and clean. While their employees aren't always the most friendly, they will assist you upon request, and are always professional. I appreciate that they take the time to their neatly fold your clothes and wrap them in tissue paper, or leave them hanging. Most of the time, they'll ask which you prefer.   They also will walk around the counter to personally hand you your bag, which is also a very nice touch.",140,3
I spent $230 on tickets for a Shen yun show  because the flier and reviews were outstanding. Immediately upon arrival no warmth from valet ::shrug:: move on to the entrance the staff was the coldest shock to me I became so uncomfortable I became confused ! and then the show comes on and everything makes sense. \n\nTo make a short story shorter I had to leave within about 15 minutes. Those dancers are extremely talented and the lifeless smith center with its stage floor that sticks out like a sore thumb absolutely did not help.  And if your going to steal my money don't call it classic 5000 years of Chinese history in one show and have a digital background that the dancers started to rely on way too much. Granted its about the majesty of the circular dance but I DID not buy into it. I take nothing away from the performers \n\nNeeds way better direction everything else took away the beauty in the moves for me... Too bad. I was really looking foward to a great show,214,0
"Pullman's is a trendy and upscale wine bar, serving small tapas-style dishes that are great for pairing with your wine of choice.\n\nTapas worth ordering: Fromages du Quebec, Charcuteries, Fried Cod with Spicy Mayo, Sesame Scallops, Port-Steeped Cheddar Grilled Cheese, and Mini Bison Burgers with Matchstick Fries.\n\nThey have an extravagant list of wines, which is great because I absolutely love wine and am always curious about trying something new. For those interested in trying various types at once, they offer \""trio's\"" based on wines by the same makers, regions, or of similar flavours, and this changes regularly.\n\nA great wine worth ordering is the Cote de Brouilly 2009, from Chateau Thivin. It is a Beaujolais from Burgundy that is smokey, dark, well balanced, and full of great flavour.\n\nThe jazzy music and elegantly busy atmosphere makes for a great night, guaranteed. The bar is spacious and spread over 3 floors, while remaining cozy and charming. The beautiful chandelier built from wine glasses are worth mentioning, and hangs over the main floor. You would never guess that this gem was hiding within an odd-looking building, let alone right across the street from Provigo, but it is and I do not think it will be going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nIf you are ready to spend some money, then this is a great place to go. Whether it be on a date, a girls night out, or for a little group gathering, it is the perfect place. In all my experiences at Pullman, the service has been satisfying. On a few, very rare, occasions the service may have been slow, but never disappointing. You want to come here to sit back, relax, and take your time enjoying the wine, food, and ambiance. Do not rush it.",391,4
"Being an expat Brit, this place speaks to me. It as close as I've seen in the US to a real British pub. The decor is authentically pub style, it's cosy and inviting and I recommend it highly.",49,4
I went here the other night with a friend of mine and we both agreed it was okay. We both got the chicken and it was good but it was anything out of the ordinary and for 20 dollars for a piece of chicken I guess we were expecting more.The service was good but we just weren't really impressed as we thought we would be.,74,2
"I am so excited that the wife and I decided to try this place! \n\nWe decided to give it a try 3 weeks ago and we have been back twice since. The food is delicious, the waiter gives great suggestions and has a great sense of humor. The decor is clean and nicer than the other places in town. We have tried a few different items from the menu and have loved each one",85,4
"The crust has a nice texture, but very little flavor, the pepperoni and cheese were very good, it was cooked well, nice and crisp on the bottom but fold-able like NY pizza should be. My biggest gripe is the dining room. My wife and I went in to order a whole pizza, we were going to eat a slice or two and take the rest home. Well, I am a big guy and I wouldn't fit in the booths. They only have those cheap Formica table/booths with everything anchored to the floor, nothing is moveable except for two chairs that if you sat in you would literally be sitting halfway in the door. So we got a slice each and sat in the car and ate it. It's a shame because the Dilworth location had normal tables and chairs. I would give them a 3 1/2 for pizza but a 1 for the dining room, so I averaged it to 2 stars. Get smart Luigi and get some tables and chairs. I won't be back until you do.",216,1
"As far as buffets go in Vegas, who rules the roost? Not Medley Buffet at Aliante, but for those living in the North/Northwest side of town - it will do.\n\nMy husband, myself, and my brother trekked here on Christmas Day for dinner. We arrived at about 1:30 PM, which I think was the \""sweet spot\"" because there was only a few others in line ahead of us, and when we were seated, there were no other patrons around us. However, as we got through our meal it got crowded real fast.\n\nThis buffet offers the \""norm\"" - meat carving station (props on the very succulent and juicy turkey, probably my fave of everything), and the prime rib was nothing to turn your nose up at. The ham though fell flat and dry. Other \""traditional offerings\"" included stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green bean casserole.\n\nOther sections of the buffet include: Asian, Mexican, and Desserts. It's not the greatest selection, nor is it the worst.\n\nAliante has been broken away from Stations Casinos for a couple years, so don't expect to be able to use your Station Card to get a discount here, you have to sign up to Aliante's players club. However, since it was Christmas, the kind cashier charged my family the players club price anyway. Per usual this is a good deal taking about $3-$4 off the norm price.\n\nI was happy to not have to cook or clean dishes after a big meal. Only downside is, we have no leftovers! Oh well.",336,2
"My check engine light was on so I took my car to them in order to pass smog. They took care of the problem, and helped me pass within a couple days. Very knowledgeable,  very informative and helpful. Both Joe and Lee always give me accurate info, price and time estimates. A week later my fuel injection went out so I had it towed to them. Luckily nothing else was damaged so I had them do a tune up while it was there. Car is running great and I highly recommend them.  I will keep coming back.",111,4
I was out in Vegas for a business trip and decided to stay at the palms place since it looked very nice in the pictures and I've read some good reviews about the place.  I stayed in the single bedroom suite. There were a bunch of things broken in my room. To start off one side of the television not working properly and on top of that the wall lamp in that general area had a broken switch. So I had insufficient lighting while i was working and a crappy half working television.  What really got me was the towel.  There was a towel on my rack on the inside fold that had blood stained cover all over it.  This is definitely the last time I will be staying at this place.,147,0
"I went to the Burger Bar and had a kobi burger with camelized onions and thought it was one of the best tasting burgers i have ever had. My brother had a buffalo burger and also enjoyed it very much. We also had onion rings and fried zucchini. It was all great and a nice place, but very busy so you will probably have to wait about 30 minutes. I do not eat meat anymore but when i cheat once or twice a year it will be here.",99,4
"This place is horrible!!!!!  The staff is everything you hope a staff would not be - think aggressive, rude, inconsiderate!  I wish Cassandra O. hadn't given them a 5 star rating, cause it severely skews what they deserve - but please take her review for only what it describes...the food!  I drive all the way to 24 Hour fitness just so I don't have to deal with these people.  Mind you I live less than a block away from LA fitness & I drive 10miles to work out at 24...I think that really says something.  If I could give them a zero star rating I would.  Its not even worth trying a week free if thats what someone is thinking.  Management should really read the things we write and consider some layoffs. \n\nPS (the assessment employee took my body fat % when I first arrived - before I had even decided to sign up - and admitted to me that they tell potential customers their body fat % is higher (about 10%) just to make them feel bad about themselves so they will sign up) BEWARE!",237,0
This place never disappoints as far as quality in smoothies go. My favorite is the Strawberry watermelon because it's so light and refreshing. The downfall is they aren't very friendly at least not consistently. And also a couple of them don't speak English very well so they couldn't answer all my questions.,66,2
"Much better than the ones in Primm and Baker, the Mad Greek Cafe attempts to satisfy the greek craving and to some extent it succeeds.  Many of the options taste very good.  I think what keeps this restaurant from jumping to the next level is 1) there are way too many menu items and no restaurant can make that many items equally tasty.  The non-greek items are often made with a greek spice or flavor much to the dismay of the children eaters.  2) the service is inconsistent.  While the manager (perhaps owner) knows what he is doing, the waitresses often do not even know all the menu items or what item can be substituted for what item.\n\nStill, we have never had a bad meal.  Also, they have live music on certain days which looks like it might be fun.  We haven't made it there yet though.",183,2
"Okay, so this is a hard one to write since I have experienced the creme de la creme of movie going experiences, which was iPic, at the Scottsdale Quarter, a mere few miles away from Studio Movie Grill. But, alas, Groupon came a knocking and we bought a few cheap tickets and decided to go last night. So, here we go. If I had NEVER been to iPic, i probably would have thought this place was the bees knees, with its sports bar atmosphere, and semi-decent seats, but since I have been spoiled, it is oh-so-hard to compare. iPic does it right. The chairs, the blankets, the swanky menu, the layout of the seats, (where servers aren't darting past you during the movie), and the fact that they serve you all of your food, all at once, no interruptions during the movie. \n\nStudio Movie Grill has sort of an airport experience. You get your ticket, then you line up for your movie, then they like cattle call you when you can \""enter\"". We know when we can enter a movie, thanks. We have all been to a movie in the last century. All you have to do is put the little \""Theater is being cleaned\"" sign out. We get it.\n\nThere is a bar outside, which is a nice feature, so you can get liquored up before you get herded like cattle. Yet, they don't give you much direction. Since I had been to iPic, I understood the whole \""servers inside the theater\"" concept, but I am sure many patrons don't, so I urge them to communicate better, as in, \""once you are seated a server will greet you and take your order\"". I think having the bar outside may make people think that they have to only order outside the theater.\n\nNow, the movie theater itself. Yikes, My fiance hit the nail on the head. If you went to a large university like we did, and was subject to lecture hall classes, or \""clicker\"" classes, this is exactly what it felt like. The chairs were office chairs. Yes, black, pleather, uncomfortable, swivel office chairs. I kid you not. And they had red buttons for \""service\"" on them. The buttons didn't bother me too much, the staff was fairly attentive. I wasn't a fan of the layout. iPic is laid out so that your servers never walk in front of you, disrupting your movie. These poor people have to run and duck every 30 seconds. Talk about back aches! \n\nFood- I had an iced tea, my mom had a margarita which I have to say was a heavy pour, which was nice. We got the sliders and they weren't bad, and the fries were delicious. The menu looked like high end sports bar, so pretty much everyone could find something on the menu to enjoy. \n\nOverall, the experience was so-so. If I want to eat and see a movie, I might as well go big or go home and go to iPic.  I figure you can do one of two things: 1. Have a regular movie going experience and go to like a plain old Harkins, or 2. Have an amazing experience, blow some extra dough, do it up style, and see a movie at iPic. Don't settle for second best.",717,1

"After Monterreys i didnt think i could go to another mexican restaurant and be satisfied. This place does that. Most everything was cool.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go here. The food is good. Atmosphere is awesome. The one thing i don't get is that their salsa isn't great and you have to dress it up. Mexican restaurants have to make great salsa! If you candle spicy order their spicy salsa mix it with their regular and put some salt in it. Awesome! However i don't like to make a concoction at a restaurant. Thats the whole reason i go to restaurants.  Other than that their regular salsa taste like it came out of jar. You have to dress up ur food, and do it right. Thats why they only got 3 stars, other than that i enjoyed myself.",171,2
"When it came to the actual dr, she was very quick and seemed very distracted, but that alone would not cause me to give 2 stars. The 2 stars is for everything else in the office. When I walked in and was waiting in line, the girls at the front desk were gossiping about patients in the waiting room. They were also speaking about bad and unintelligent other girls in the office were. They didn't even stop when I was standing staring at them. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. \n\nThen about a month and a half later, I received a bill from the office. I called to explain to them that they had incorrect insurance information and tried to give them the correct. The billing girl, Jenna, stated that she did nothing wrong and had the correct information and that she refused to resubmit the claim with the correct information.

We did the three course prefixe and the third course was to pick dessert from Bar Cocoa. I'm not quite sure how the brunch was so good and Bar Cocoa was so bad..

"HORRIBLE customer service!!\n\nBack in January 2013 I purchased a galaxy s3. The associate made me think I was using my upgrade to get a discount on the phone for extending my contract (which Is the way I thought upgrades worked). Today, I went in to get a new phone because the screen on my s3 shattered and I wanted to switch to the iPhone, anyway. They told me I still had a balance of about 200.00 remaining on my s3 that needed to be paid off before I could use my \""Jump\"" to get the iphone. They looked through my file to see that I had signed up to pay the remainder of the s3, which discounted my plan the amount of the monthly payments so my bill stayed the same. So in the end I was paying the full amount ($500something dollars) WHILE STILL EXTENDING MY CONTRACT. When I told the associate that I felt like I was tricked, he replied, \""no, because you're paying the same amount of money,\"" I about lost it.\n\nSO, in order to get a new phone I will have to get the screen fixed ($150) Pay off the remainder of the s3 ($200), and put a down payment on a new phone ($???).\n\nI suppose it was my fault for not reading what I was signing but I feel as tough it is the associates duty to explain what I'm paying for.\n\nI have been with TMobile for 8 years and I am highly disappointed.

I have no clue who the guards are, but they do a good job. \n\nIgnoring the outside shenanigans, this is a solid Walgreens. Def bigger than the one on Fremont St and typically very quiet. They have a drive-thru pharmacy for those peeps who don't like looking another human in the eyes while picking up rx and typically 3 people staffing the inner pharmacy section. This helps with the wait time immensely.

"This is the Hal Price Books store closest to where I live, so I go there quite frequently due to its convenient location. There are some things about this store that are good, some that are bad, and one that is downright ugly.\n\nThe Good: They have a good selection of books and great prices on remainder books. The store is well-organized and clean, including the restrooms.\n\nThe Bad: They only off cash for your items and not much at that. If you are not looking for cash, you are much better off trying Zia and Bookmans first.\n\nThe Ugly: The vinyl record section is awful, and almost unbelievably, it is worse than it was a year ago. They recently instituted a foolish policy of taping certain used records shut in plastic bags. I was told by an employee that this was due to customers \""turning $50 records into $5 records.\"" This is pure bunk! Some of the records they have taped shut are under $10! When I asked to see one of the records outside of the bag, the employee was unable to figure out how to remove it. Another employee had to intervene and managed to get the tape stuck on the jacket, damaging it. I have been to over 30 different Half Price Books stores across the southwestern United States, and this store has the dubious distinction of having the worst managed vinyl section of any of them.",289,2

"I have been coming here for many years on special occasions and bringing guests from out of town. Unfortunately the food quality and service have now been surpassed by many local steakhouses in town. I always have found the women at the front desk cold and unwelcoming but I have always looked past that because of the great food and service. Clearly we were not a priority on this visit. We were stuffed into a corner in the back of the dining room where we were motley forgotten about. Our servers style was that of a sports coach shouting at a team. The ordering of drinks was quite delayed and took a long time between each order. Food arrived about an hour after ordering. Salads and soups were mediocre in flavor and presentation. Steak quality was very chewy and undercooked compared to our past experiences. Sides were soupy and overcooked. The new sommelier was no help in choosing wine as he was too pre-osccupied and also had lost his voice. I miss the former sommelier who was excellent. The server kept doing drive by check-ins and kept forgetting what we asked for throughout the evening. Just not acceptable overall experience for the Four Seasons in my opinion.  Fortunately we are discovering other fantastic steak houses in town with much better food and great service for less money. We are loving Barrymore's, Twin Creeks Happy Hour, Flemings and Silverado Steakhouse!!",285,1

"Lunch at work today brought me to Wasabi Jane's in the Venetian's food court. Normally I would just go to Walgreens but I was craving some Asian food and on a 30 minute break from work the food court was my only option. I usually just swing by Panda Express even though I'm not much of a fan because its quick and generally reliable. Today however I made the dramatic change of 50 ft across the food court (mainly b/c when I went to Panda they looked like they just got smashed with a lunch rush and the choices were limited) to Wasabi Janes. It is a $1 and change more ($7.99) for a 2item combo with 1 side than PE. So I figured what the heck I'll try it... looked pretty good. \n1) food selection was decent with a few different items from PE but I don't think as many selections.\n2) the lady behind the counter asked me \""is that all?\"" after I had already told her I wanted the combo and all that was on my plate was rice. I didn't laugh at her though. **pats self on back**\n3) the food was not as fresh or hot as i would have liked for it to be\n4) the food did taste good though and the portion was a bit larger than my normal portions from PE\n\nNormally I would go back and ask for something different or for them to heat it up but I just didn't have time today. Overall, not a terrible experience but not the best either. Probably right on par with PE in my book. May give them another try sometime when I'm craving Chinese again at work.

Even though the store has a great selection, Nancy went out of her way to make sure the diamond I was looking for was there for me to view. I chose to have my ring crafted and have not been disappointed. It's not a build your own from a selection they offer, like you see on-line. It's an actual person that creates your jewelry by what you design or request.  The customer service has been wonderful.

I asked for handroll yellowtail with oshinko(Japanese yellow pickle) and Chef said only what's on the menu. C'mon now....they had both on menu but just not together. What's the big deal? It's NOT like adding more fish, only a vegetable. Point deducted for service here. Asked for mochi(NOT included in AYCE), of course she doesn't mention this.

"Went there with my husband last night to celebrate our 15th anniversary.  Had been once or twice and sat at bar.  Had good experiences and enjoyed the variety of vegetarian options.  Food was good last night, but our waitress needed some serious help.\nThe ordering went well enough, but while we were eating our delicious pasties the waitress started bussing the table behind us.  She knocked over what I think was a pretty good amount of red wine in a glass on the table and then left quickly. My husband's back was to the table and he had felt a splash on his arm. I went and looked behind his chair, saw the spill, and saw a huge splatter of wine across the back of his creme colored shirt.  Wine was also a platter ed on the floor.  \nThe best I could tell is that our waitress either had very dull eyesight or was hoping we wouldn't notice.  Another employee walked by and saw what happened and I told her it was our waitress.  Waitress came back about 5 minutes later and offered to \""blot\"" the wine out w/water......really..like that would work.  She then asked us if we wanted anything else, dessert, if my husband wanted another beer.  She ended up taking off $14.  Said she bought us a round, but $14 didn't even cover our 2 beers much less the cost of my husband's ruined shirt.  \nPretty much ruined our anniversary dinner and she didn't give a true apology.  After reading other reviews it seems like service is an issue at this location.  If we ever go back, I would most likely sit at the bar or counter to hopefully avoid inconsiderate waitresses spilling food or drink.",369,1
"Wow...it looks like this place does not have many stars from other people...I didn't even look at reviews before writing mine. Tomorrow I'm going to try and track down the corporate office. Even one star is too much!\n\nPatron's beware! McFadden's in Glendale, Arizona has hands-down one of the worst customer service policies ever! It is like this bar runs on a crew with their heads up each other's asses! Basically, this place SUCKS!!! \n\nMy experience was so terrible the only way to keep it together, without writing a book, was bullet points:\n* Attempted to organize an event for 20-15 employees. Had an office member contact the restaurant the week before to set it up. Relations person was more concerned with taking the credit card info to charge us if we did not show, or had less people, than sending the agreement. We never got anything in writing with these policies on it! Surprise, surprise...the only thing in the file was the credit card without a booked reservation.\n* Tried to call the location the day of the event to confirm. Was told by the hostess that I was not allowed to speak to a manager about this issue and she would not find someone for me to check the reservation. Called back with a different name and held for 14 minutes to speak to a manager that just said \""Sarah\"" was off and would be coming in...Um, how is her staffing my issue? I had to badger her to even look into the issue.\n* Finally worked out the details and had tables reserved, the day of the event while my party was on the freeway going to the location. The first guests arrived after making our complaints to the manager and one of the bartenders made the remark \""Those are some big shoes to fill\"" to our assigned server in front of guests. What, because we had to call to make sure we had a place to go?\n* The place smelled like vomit!! (Also noted in another customer's review)\n* Terrible, terrible, terrible service! Our server would only take one drink order at a time and often left the table without asking the customers with empty classes if they wanted another beverage. Hello...dumb ass...empty glasses means more opportunity to make more money?! Maybe the mandatory 18% tip for the party size blew our chances at having any sort of service. \n* Drinks and food were sent to our table that we did not order. Food runners gave us attitude and stormed off when we told them the food did not belong to us.\n* Bill arrived with over $100 in extra charges for drinks we did not order were on it. We asked the server about it and her response was \""Well, I am NOT taking them off\"" and walked off. \n* Had to ask for another manager to come over because of the inflated bill. Took 20 minutes for him to get to us and the restaurant was not even busy. Manager was extremely patronizing and was not going to help us at first. After having to re-hash the details he took some of the drinks off, but not all of them. He claimed that the service \""might\"" not have been that great because it was St. Patrick's Day that week. Didn't they have like 364 days to get ready for this? \n* Waited another 30 minutes to get our change back. After coming back to the table the server put the bill and change in my face, glared at me and walked away. No \""thank you\"" or anything for the 18% tip she was guaranteed because the size of the party. In all honesty, I would have totally stiffed her if it were a smaller party.\n\nI was embarrassed that my group had to experience this. The only reason we decided to go there was one of my guests had won a happy-hour event there. My gut feeling when I could not confirm the reservation was to just go somewhere else, but was afraid that the only thing they would do correctly was charge the credit card for a no show. Knowing this I would have taken the group to Applebee's where we would have expected this. Our state relies on tourism and looking at the issue from a higher level the industry decline in does not rest only on the economy, but at these eateries internally. I am starting to point blame at the terrible customer in the service industry, weak and inexperienced restaurant/bar management, and shoddy company policies for their decline. If the industry truly cared about customers it would not be in this predicament.\n\nDid anyone notice that their staff member was the only one to give this place like 5 stars? Maybe she should be a customer in it instead of part of the \""family\"".",994,0
"We ended up at Ka not knowing what to expect. We went to the 50% off ticket place the morning of and chose whatever show had 4 seats together and was the cheapest, Ka was the winner. \nI will have to second Eugine y.'s assessment, \""this show is insane!\"" This is what Vegas is all about, seeing something you would not see anywhere else and completely blowing your mind. I would say that compared to all the Cirque shows I have seen thus far, Ka was the darkest. If you are trying to decide on a Cirque show and don't want something flowery, Ka is your show. Ka is complex and  awe- inspiring. The artists/performers are incredible. The stage is set up so that any seat really is an excellent seat. I would recommend sitting in the middle of the audience so that you can see the entire stage.",183,3
"I declare that Chang's is the only dim sum in Las Vegas.  By comparison, everything else is just a bunch of mashed-up food stuff in steam dishes.  Me and my girlfriend have probably been here 6 or 7 times, and the only disappointment we've ever had was that her favorite crispy-topped BBQ pork buns were all gone.  If you make the slightest effort to speak Chinese, the waitresses (who are mostly from Guangdong but all speak at least okay Mandarin and can definitely understand all the rudimentary things I can say) will fawn all over you and be your buddies forever.   I don't even want to try describing the best dishes because I won't even scratch the surface.  Just go during lunch on a weekday, order a ton of food, and say I was right.",169,4
"I have always been a fan of the MGM-Mirage properties having stayed at both the Mirage and Treasure Island (TI) on previous trips. I have to say that the MGM Grand rates much lower in comparison. \n\nBeing an MGM-Mirage Players Club member, I was offered a promotional rate via email: $59.99 (Monday - Thursday) and $79.99 (Friday). This was much such a good deal that I couldn't pass it up, in the past I usually booked through either Expedia, Orbitz, or Travelocity. \n\nI have one of the MGM-Mirage credit cards which offers certain perks such as earning Gift Certificates, Invited Guest Check-In, and Early/Late Check-Out. \n\nDuring this visit I was able to use the Invited Guest Check-In, which you think would be more efficient since this is the line that people with Casino Hosts use. I was only the third person in line, and it took longer than if I would've waited in the normal check-in lines 5 or 6 people deep. \n\nThe room was nothing too special, it had a view of the parking garage and Koval Lane. The TV was outdated (TI had upgraded to LCD TVs in 2006). The best part of the room was the bed, which was surprisingly comfortable. \n\nI'm not sure if it was isolated to our room but there was an adjoining door to the room next to us that seemed as if it was paper thin, we could hear normal conversations being carried out late at night and early in the morning. \n\nThe pool is a mystery to find. I am thinking that the pool was more accessible in the past before the hotel did renovations in connecting the MGM Grand to the MGM Signature Towers. From the elevator,  you need to walk through some shopping areas down a long corridor to the pool. \n\nI almost think that the casino is too big at the MGM Grand. If you want to visit any of the other casinos in the area: NY NY or Excalibur it is a very long walk from the elevators to the walkways of these casinos. Also, some of the slots are very dated, especially the quarter slots. We had a slot machine malfunction twice in about a 30 minute time frame. Also, with the casino being so big, the cocktail waitresses are nowhere to be found in the slots areas. \n\nI would wait for a room renovation before staying here again.",525,1
"I been here before and I really don't remember much from the first time, but I was looking for a place for lunch and decided to come back.  First thing that I noticed was that they had a special running, 4 tacos chicken or al pastor for 6.99.  Wow that is like 1.75 a taco, not much of a deal.  I came in and didn't see much on the abbreviated menu.  No meals with beans and rice, just tacos, burritos, and tortas if I remember right.  I decided I would get the special and split between 2 chicken and 2 al pastor.  I also asked for chips and was surprised to see that I had to pay for a small basket with salsa.  Well I wanted chips so I forked my money over.  The tacos were not bad, but this is the weird part.  I have had al pastor many times, and for some reason this one tasted like Chinese BBQ pork.  I swear if I didn't know better it might have been.  Over all the place was not that bad, but 2 blocks either way , you can get way better food.",245,1
"Maybe a 3.5 ?\n\nIt was nothing fancy, not a large choice of beers, a share plate of cheese with two good ones and a tasteless one, a really nice service.\n\nI guess it's worth seeing another time, it was on a Friday night and it was not too noisy, so it's kind of a good thing to just hang out and have a chat.",87,2
"I decided to try a new Pho location other than Jenni Pho. This one had good reviews and I just so happen to be on this side of town. It was really busy which is always a good sign. However, the pho tai nam lacked a lot of flavor. The broth needs more spices and flavor to it. I had to add a lot of extra items to the pho that I usually don't add to get some type of flavor that was digestible. I definitely will not be returning.",102,2
"I was told by my cousin that one thing I had to eat in Montreal was a crepe, so I looked up Muru Crepe on yelp. I'm so glad I did! My husband and I walked up here when we were exploring Old Montreal. I ordered the Savoyarde crepe and my husband ordered the Attention crepe. He loved the spicy flavors and the chili in his crepe. I thought mine was better, personally. It was savory, creamy, and perfect. Both crepes were stuffed to the brim, which I loved. They didn't skimp on the filings! We both got a green salad and fries. The salad was very good, but the fries were absolutely amazing! I don't know exactly what spices they used on them, but the fries were perfectly salted and had just the right amount of other seasonings. I had to have the waitress take my plate away because I couldn't stop eating them! Love this place and can't wait to go back!",201,4
"For me the atmosphere was better than the meal.  From the outside, it looks like your standard neighborhood bar, but on the inside, you'll think you stepped into a trendy new hotspot at the Wynn or the Bellagio.  Dim lighting, attractive servers, and groovy music all come together nicely.  I especially like the old movies playing on the flat-screens above the bar.\n\nAbout the food:  Appetizer was great.  Entree was not so great.  I ordered these marinated meatballs as a starter that had wonderful flavor.  I should have made a meal out of them, but opted for the filet mignon with a mac & cheese side.  Be careful how you order it because medium well somehow got translated into well-done.  So my steak arrived as a flavorless, dried-out piece of beef jerky.  And the mac & cheese was a little too bland for my taste.  To be fair though, my buddy ordered the same steak medium RARE and his looked (and tasted) much better.  I also preferred his mushroom side to my mac & cheese.  Those were the best marinated shrooms I've ever eaten.  So altogether, I'd say the food can be hit or miss.\n\nAbout the price.  I thought for a \""$$\"" designation, I would be under $30 (Yardhouse pricing), but after an appetizer, entree with a side, and a decent tip (20%), I was into this meal for $75.  I wasn't on a date; I was just grabbing a late-night dinner with a friend. So this was a bit more than I wanted to pay.\n\nWould I go here again? Sure, but maybe during happy hour when the menu is a little cheaper.",373,2
"Starbucks is my go-to place when Cafe Myriade is too packed, or it's raining/snowing way too hard to get to Pikolo Espresso Bar in a good mood. This coffee shop is in my area, so it's convenient. \n\nBut that's about it. \n\nIt's hyped up and commercial coffee. It's always got a ridiculous, unnecessary line up, and the baristas can NEVER (I really mean NEVER) get my name right when they insist on putting it down on the cups - even after I spell it out to them it comes out in the most bastardized form. But... I'll still walk in on my break from work or class to get a good Americano and walk out satisfied.",160,2
Last minute booking for work at this hotel. It was $89 a night Mon - Thursday. I wasn't too thrilled to be staying at this hotel but it was cheap. \n\nHere are some Pros and Cons:\n\nFree Wifi\nFree Parking and Valet\nGym was pretty nice and AC was on pretty high which is a plus.\nSuede restaurant was actually pretty good.\nThey had a promotion where you get 500 starwood points if you waive housekeeping each night. Not bad.\n24/7 Starbucks downstairs\nComplimentary Water\n\nCons\nNoisy\nPretty small pool\nNot many slot machines in this casino and it seems like this hotel is bad for gaming.\nShowers were very low and some noticeable stains in the rooms.\n\nI would probably stay here again just for the Starwood points but there are definitely better options to stay during the week.,199,2
"This place has gone from a great place to hit golf balls to one of the worst.  You can no longer hit any type of driver, fair way club (3,5 or 7 wood) or any hybrid club. This goes for women too.

If you're looking for a \""different than the norm\"" dining experience in a spirited atmosphere with plenty of beer - this is the place.\n\nAs the Germans say...Prost!  Enjoy!",163,3
"Disappointing. I had found this place ahead of time, and liked the menu so I brought a few friends from a conference we were attending. I'm from the East Coast so I was looking forward to some good Mexican food in Arizona. Ha. I've had better enchiladas in Delaware. \n\nI ordered the Green Chile Barbacoa Enchiladas, which the waitress gushed about, but also because I had decided to get them ahead of time since they sounded great. Meh. No kick to them at all, but also there was really nothing inside them. They seemed small and empty. They looked real pretty on the plate, I'll give them that, but they were mild in taste. Sort of a tourist version of an enchilada. My friends were equally unenthused about their dishes, though they said they were \""good.\"" \n\nOn the plus side, the corn bread they served us was tasty.",196,1

The froyo is creamy, delicious, and addictive.  \n\nThe place has a cute, vintage feel to it.. kind of like you're in someone's back yard.  \n\nMy hips are glad I don't live closer... my taste buds... not so much.",161,4
"Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) \n\nthis is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)\n\nSo after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. \n\nI responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg\n\nSo it was not enough for them to say that message.

I have tasted probably every expensive bourbon out there outside of early BTAC and unobtainable stuff like AH Hirsche, Eagle Rare 101 etc so I know how to properly taste whiskey and take notes. His tasting class was off basis and caterers towards the extremely inexperienced and is just wrong on certain points and also a complete ripoff considering the price and what he pours for you. After that I found out that he was asking prices like $75 bucks a pour for the rare whiskies and up to $200 a pour for some others. That is just highway robbery. I suggest you skip this place entirely and put together your own tastings with friends and family.",182,0
"The Light pretty much sucks in my book. Everything from the layout, the sound system, and the decor sucks. The only thing they have going for them are the LED screens, cirque dancers, and that unfortunately, all the \""cool\"" people go here now.\n\nOther than LED lights flashing at you, there is nothing visually captivating about the club. Clubs like XS, Surrender, and Tryst are so beautiful and plush inside, making your time there feel so balling and glamorous. The Light looks straight up like a dark warehouse club in LA.\n\nThe layout of the club promotes just buying a table and staying there. No walking around... no mingling. Isn't that the whole point of going to Vegas? (It certainly is for me). I like to walk around the club, meet people at different tables, and talk to people. It is annoying as hell to walk up different levels to get to different tables or the bar area, and the club walkway just doesn't seem to \""flow.\""\n\nAlong the same lines as socializing, it is hard as hell to have a conversation with someone here. It is so freaking loud. There were times I felt like my eardrums were about to pop out of my head. I actually saw some people walking around with ear plugs.\n\nSo I guess if you just like listening to house music (they DO have really good DJs), then you'll really like it here.

I've spent hundreds of $$ in charms that I can no longer use because of this, and I didn't even ask them to replace their own faulty ring...I was going to pay for the replacement part.

"I went here on a friday night when a sushi craving struck me while in Madison. We were seated immediately in a separate sushi room. We were the only ones there. It was a little bit awkward, just us and the sushi chefs. While seated, they called over a buddy from the bar and were joking and yelling in spanish for a while. Points go down for atmosphere...\n\nOur waiter was either very fast or very slow with service. We ordered two appetizers and sushi at the same time. The sushi was done first, and we saw it sitting on top of the sushi bar for a full 10 to 15 minutes. It was five feet away from me, and I was tempted to just get up and fetch it, but the waiter came back eventually. He brought us one of the appetizers and the sushi. We never saw the other appetizer...like we never even ordered it. We were not charged for it, but I still wasn't thrilled.\n\nSushi quality was very mediocre. I didn't get ill afterwards, so that's good. We had some weiiiird looking cuts of fish on our rainbow roll. We didn't eat it but we did look at it askance before putting it on the side of the plate. The sushi is WAY overpriced for the quality. \n\nThe close proximity to the bar was a little annoying, some guy was shouting about his ass the whole time.

"Amazing!\n\nI'll admit it, the boyfriend and I are snobs and we usually steer clear of buffets. This past weekend we were staying at the Encore, it was a Sunday morning, two friends joined us for brunch and as we were walking around the resort we walked right into the buffet. We were just about to walk away from it when we got a bit curious and decided to check it out. \n\nThe line was ridiculous! It was Sunday brunch so I think the price was $32 a person. We didn't want to wait in line, so we paid the extra $15 a person for the VIP pass. $15 includes, line cuts to the front, and a free drink, your choice of sangria, wine or a mimosa. Not a bad deal since the hosts in the front told us that the line was 45 mins to an hour long. No thanks!\n\nThe buffet was amazing! As we were being walked to our seats we were oooing and ahhing at all the desserts and the large amount of food selection. They were prompt with the alcoholic drinks and we went on our way through the food. The selections seemed endless so half of us just walked to the end just so we could see everything to mentally prep our stomachs. \n\nThere was an omelets station, prime rib and fatty bacon cutting station, fresh sushi, fresh shrimp, tons of pasta selections, everything breakfast related, fresh fruit and baked goods, Mexican cuisine, Asian cuisine etc. Lets just say everything was there!\n\nThe highlights: Fatty bacon was delicious with their special mustard. The shrimp wasn't your typical baby cocktail shrimp, definitely huge fatty juicy shrimp with cocktail sauce, cups of marinated watermelon and pineapple (the pineapple was marinated in rum and coconut flakes)\n\nEverything we ate was delicious, by the time we got to desserts we were stuffed. We tried a few cakes (all yummy) and their gellato! Yes you heard right, they had many flavors of gellato for you to choose from. I would definitely advise not to fill up on the bread (although delicious) definitely fills you up so you can't eat all the other amazing food there.\n\nAside from the food, the service was amazing as well. Empty plates and cups were always cleared promptly from our table.",489,4
Husband and I went for dinner and we really liked the food.  He had a shrimp PO-boy and I had the Crab Landry.  The crab dish was good but a bit too much rue.  The shrimp that came on top is what made it good.  We both agree the best part was the red beans and rice he got as a side.  We took home what was left (PO-boy filled him up) and I reheated it and mixed it with my gumbo and it was great.  4 stars because I had to wait awhile for my plate while my husband was almost done with his due to mixup in kitchen.   Loved drinking from a mason jar too! Just like home!  Go here if you want Cajun fast food and Pappadeaux's if you want a nice sit down Cajun meal.  Either way they are both good.,179,3

The Lounge also carries my favorite gin (Hendrick's), which is not extraordinarily common in bars around here.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the people here always seem friendly.  It has never been crowded when I am there, which is fine by me.  I am almost afraid to give such an outstanding review, in fear of it becoming popular, because I like this little gem that Christina P. introduced me to just the way it is!",137,4
I've heard so many good things about Yu-Yu and let me tell you... I'm glad that I came here!  This really brought me back to Japan and everything is to die for!  The tonkatsu is out of this world!  Prices are very reasonable and portions sizes are perfect!  The service was just as awesome and the wait staff are so kawaii!!!  Arigato Sanae-chan and Aoi-chan!,94,4
"I was really in between a 3 and 4 stars for this place. We came for happy hour which is the bomb. Free chips and salsa, little cheesy tortilla things, and fruit. They had some good drink deals... but I was the lowly DD. Service was slow... and when I say slow I mean like a turtle walking in molasses. It took about 20 minutes just to get a soda. I could have driven to Frys and bought my own. \n\nThe atmosphere is ok, just bar-ish. The food on the normal menu is wayyy over priced for Mexican. I ended up ordering the fancy shmancy hot dog which you can personalize. I asked for guac on mine but didn't get any. It took about 45 minutes to even get my hot dog and I was so hungry I wasn't going to let that thing out of my sight.\n\n If  you do happen to stumble upon this place ask for the flour tortilla chips-I could live my life happily only eating those things :)",217,2
"While this style of food may appeal to some, it's just not for me. At the recommendation of a friend, we were told to try the tacos. The chicken tacos arrived in what appeared to be homemade taco shells. The shells are thicker and seemed to be deep fried and a little greasy. The chicken (as another reviewer stated) is deep fried. Honestly, this tasted like Kentucky Fried Tacos to me, and since I'm not a fan of fried chicken, this wasn't an enjoyable meal. \n\nMy wife got the Caribbean Martini and while she said it was delicious, the martini glass wasn't filled close to the top. \n\nI'm giving it 2 stars (rather than 1) because the service was good and the menu is priced well.",165,1
Best smoothies around. Food's pretty good too. Try the Health Nut smoothie with Whey Protein. For food go with the Thai Chicken wrap.,31,4
I gave it two stars only because it's close to where I live! Other than that there's really not much to like about this location because the staff don't greet you or acknowledge you when your in the store. When checking out they have attitudes and are very unprofessional. Today I bought candles and spent a pretty penny and the cashier didn't offer to wrap my candles and put then in three tiny bags that were very heavy and not protected.,94,1
"Food wasn't that good for an expensive steak house, a step above Outback. Supposedly our waiter had been there for 40 years, he sucked!!!!! Service was terrible",38,1
"I couldn't get a read on this place from online sources.  Upon driving over there, my friend and I realized it was a pool hall and bar with finger food.  It looked like a fine blue collar place for pool / beer after work.  It didn't serve meals and was definitely not a place for white collar guys like us.\n\nI recommend going there only if you know someone who already frequents the place.",92,1
Staff isnt too friendly until they know you are about to purchase. \n\nTons of selection! \nLots of mirrors!,28,2
Love this dairy queen location they always get my orders right and I love there blizzards and they always are top notch when it comes to service and customer service.,34,4
"We used to eat here quite a bit, but the quality has gone down. The chicken was always moist and fresh, but the last five or so times it has been dried out and flavorless. We usually order 'to-go', but the last time we ate in I was surprised by the lack of cleanliness. I'd like to see them clean up and learn to serve chicken safely without it tasting like saw dust.",87,1
"3.5 stars. My review of the NYC location received 5 stars. As of now my wife & I visited 2 different Scarpetta locations both NYC & Las Vegas & while both restaurants were great, Scarpetta in NYC blew me away!!! This time I tried the infamous Scott Conant spaghetti & must say, it was really good. The flavors were alive & the pasta was perfectly al dente. Very good. Still, the NYC location is better. Even the bread basket was slightly off in Las Vegas but still good. I guess the difference in chefs changed things a little. Not to mention service was a little lifeless & cold. Still I'm affectionate about Scarpetta. In NYC that is lol.",147,2
Food was good but a bit heavy on the garlic in every dish for me.  Enjoyed the family style service.   The chocolate torta is THE reason to go again.,35,2
Very convenient to Uptown festivities!  Located right in the EpiCentre on College this hotel and fun lounge is a great place to stay while in Charlotte.  The rooms are trendy and cool - sporting bright colors and nice finishes.  The lounge area is really casual and fun.  It overlooks the top of the EpiCentre AA5 outdoor patio.  Full bar and wine selections available at the lounge.  Not as classy as the other hotels nearby but definitely worth a shot!,96,2
"I went here with the BF tonight, as we had bought a groupon for this place. When we walked in, we were (not) greeted by the hostess who put up her finger, as in 1 minute... she was on the phone. She finally put the person on hold and showed us to a table. She was real pleasant *sarcasm* Anyway, so the first thing I noticed is that this restaurant is really dark. Like I had trouble reading the menu it was so dark. That aside, our server was nice... kind of slow, but nice, and she had a cool accent. They brought out bread, which was really good. It came with this spicy stuff (couldn't tell what was in it because it was dark) and also really good garlic butter. The waitress asked if we wanted wine... but the price per glass was pretty steep for just a house wine (8$), so we passed. I ordered the new york sirloin steak and the BF got the lasagna. Both were pretty meh. The steak was pretty fatty and was supposed to come with a wine sauce with onions, but really lacked in flavor. It came with a potato thing that I thought was going to be really good from reading others' reviews, but it was kind of bland. The lasagna was also kind of meh. It had parts of it that were of a weird consistency and it just lacked in overall flavor. Despite this, we ordered dessert, the tiramisu. This was the best part of the night, it wasn't the best tiramisu, but it was decent. It was also nice that the owner came around and said hi and then later let us get a chance at winning a free meal, so that was appreciated. Overall, it just wasn't anything that special, and for the prices... it should be special.",373,2
"I think the rolls are overpriced. The sashimi platter is the best deal there. \n\nThe bar is incomplete. No Tanqueray. Who doesn't have Tanqueray? ESPECIALLY in the summer. \n\nSome nights they have Dray and the Heavie Heads spin electro-rock-reggae-hip-hop in the open area in the back. \n\nI think I've been there on some of the busy nights ... and its not that busy. \n\nDecor is nice. But again. I don't eat decor. \n\np.s. What's the deal with all of the sushi joints on Sahara? \n\n* off the strip, non-casino",155,1
"This is the WORST pharmacy I have ever used! Customer service is horrible, there is always a long wait and twice now I have dropped off a prescription and heard nothing for days about it being ready, I go to pick it up and they don't have it and have to order. Courtesy call? None. Central location to my house is the only reason why I ever used this pharmacy, from now on I will drive the extra mile! Steer clear!",94,0
"The place itself is nice, service OK. Their garlic knots are pretty good but pasta not and pizza blah. I find their food dry and tasteless. The only was I would choose their food is if it was for free and even then that is a maybe.",53,1
"Stayed one night on July 11th.  Got in pretty late so no line at check-in.  The provided us with the requested room type as well as a late check in.  Room was in the paradise tower.  Fairly large room didn't spend a lot of time in it, but was nice and we had no problems.  I liked the Casino not overly large and tables located in center as you walk in.  I did stay up pretty late, or is it early, playing blackjack (until 530 am or so) and at around 3am all the good looking female dealers seem to get off leaving mostly older gentlemen, including the cooler who iced our table at around 5 am. I didn't see some of the slots I enjoyed at other hotel during this trip (superman, ghostbusters, wheel of fortune multi player, and block party).  The overall appearance of the Hotel is very nice, sort of old with a modern feel if that's possible.  Like others said very bright which was a plus.  The pool was really nice, but be ready its ice cold.  And of course the free cookie is a good breakfast with a starbucks.  If this hotel was center strip would be way more popular, but I liked it and might stay again.",270,3
"I have never heard of this place prior to browsing the pages of Vegas restaurants on the Restaurant.com website.  I read the reviews here- and figured that we had to try it.\n\nFirst I want to say that this location is not in a sketchy part of town as someone else mentioned.  I grew up in Vegas, and this is just an older part of town.\n\nParking is okay.  It's actually kind of hard to figure out where you are supposed  to park, but we were informed that next time we can park at the old Al Phillips cause that place in un-occupied.\n\nSo lets get to to food.  It is so hard to decide what to get.  We don't like pastrami, but the menu is full of things that aren't pastrami.  So we ended up with burgers.  My husband had the Big Ass Bacon Cheeseburger.  It was good- and huge.  It has a ton of cheese- really, it's a lot.  Almost too much.  The fries were decent, but they are like shoestring fries and we aren't really a fan of those- a friend of ours says they have fatter fries, we'll have to check next time.  The strawberry lemonade was AWESOME.  The hamburger meat seems a little bland though- maybe add some season salt?  Luckily the burgers are piled with a bunch of other stuff that's got some flavor so it's still good.\n\nThe building is kinda like a little shack.  The indoor dining area has 5 tables I believe and each table seats 4.  There is also outdoor seating.  I don't know if they have highchairs- I didn't see any(they do have a kids menu though).  I don't know about a customer bathroom either?\n\nThe guy who rings you up is the owner I believe.  He kinda talks A LOT- well not kinda, he talked about random things to all the customers eating almost the entire time we were there(he also liked to brag about all the food and how good it was).  Don't get me wrong- the food is good, but I think some of it is a bit overdone and impossible to eat and it's not like I was in food heaven while eating it.  So if you want a quiet lunch- eat outside.\n\nThis place is good and the prices are good.  We will return.",521,3
"not ooh Bagel Bagel\n\nWell its more standard bagel issue, it's no salt n peppa hit, thats for sure...I used to work round the corner from here, and the pastrami bagel was 10/10 - alas they have reduced their range, and ergo the pastrami bagel is no more.\n\nI'm over that now, as the Soho Club is pretty damn good - a good range of bagel options such as onion, wholewheat, plain blah blah\n\nfast service and relatively well priced - this is the best place for food on the run before you jump on the train... coffee is a little average also - so hit up the starbucks on thehigh street before hand",152,2
maybe its me mayeb im just having bad luck with service and food but yet again disappointed wife took me here for brunch for my birthday got sat at a empty table when i say empty nothing on top no plates no napkins silverware not even salt and pepper had to wait 10 mins to get water 15 mins to talk to our server 30 mins for bread wife got a thing of nutella that came 10 mins before the bread food was jus ok then came the best noone came to check on us or refill our water was about to walk out since no one was bothering to bring us a check,125,1
"My go to spot when I'm angry at my tummy.  I mean this in the nicest way possible.   \""What's that you say?  You need more veggies?\""   as I take another bite of my California burrito stuffed to the absolute limit with steak, cheese, and potatoes.  As it's pleading for help I add to it with a heaping forkful of Carne Asada fries and wash it down with whatever alcoholic beverage I might be indulging myself with that evening (early morning?)\n\nGreat for drive homes where it's 3 am and you're trying to remember when the last time you ate was and what kind of food you might have available when you'll wake up and dont want to move.  \n\nMy list of recommended food:\n1.  California burrito (steak, cheese, fries.   3 essentials to late night dining)\n2.  Machaca Burrito (Shredded beef, eggs.  Breakfast OR Dinner.  Or Both.  HAVE YOUR PREFERRED HOT SAUCE ON HAND before ordering)\n3.  Carne Asada Fries (you can't ever get enough fries, cheese and steak)\n4.  Carnitas Burrito/Carnitas Plate (when you're sick of gut busting steak and instead want gut busting pork)\n5.  Adobada Burrito/Carne Asada Burrito/Chorizo Burrito (eenie, meenie..)\n\nYou really can't go wrong IMO, though I personally am not a fan of their chicken overall, and I tried the Flying Saucer on a whim because it was the most expensive thing on the menu and I expected them to hand over the keys to the store based on the other menu items' relative value, and instead it was just some disappointing tostada thing.",383,3
"They don't know their own policies... Hotel switched ownership... As a Hilton, it absolutely is a mess... No pool towels ... Always \"" we are cleaning and folding them\""...

"Never been before. We were in Phoenix for a concert across the street.\n\nI ordered the Danny Boy's Sheppard's Pie.  Boring. One note flavor, and just covered up by boxed potatoes.  It's served with \""toasted\"" bread. Mine; burnt.\n\nI also ordered a Ceaser's salad.  Poor thing... drowned twice in dressing.\n\nMy water was good, though. And our waitress at least made eye contact with me, and not just the boys.",111,1
"We heard a lot of hype about this place being that it was all over the news and radio for being the scariest haunted house in the US. However, I was slightly disappointed for two reasons, one of them being out this place's control. \n1.) There was still a slight wait so just as our group made it to the front and would be the next batch in, we were kicked out because of a \""threat\"". Police surrounded, which made us go back out to try to get our money back. However, we were told it was a bomb threat from a suspicious package being found in a pitch black portion of the haunted maze. Apparently a little kid got lost inside as well, so they had to go find him.  And they wouldn't let us get our money back, so our options were to wait until it was ok to go back in, or leave and forfeit the $25. So we waited, took about 90 minutes (no bomb, found the kid I guess). By then, unfortunately, the fear and adrenaline has subsided, especially when the \""actors\"" also had to evacuate and you could see it really wasn't that scary. \n2.) After waiting to go in, we got to go inside slightly after midnight, but with all the rush of everyone wanting to go in and the actors being tired, we all got rushed through and finished in about 20 minutes versus the 45min we were told it would take. Also ,there was no Jacob Kell theme, or maybe I misunderstood from reading the legend on the website that we weren't going to an actual haunted house, but a warehouse decked out in scary type stuff. There were clowns, and if the theme was to mock a serial killer, I don't really know where clowns fit in. \n\nHere are some things I enjoyed: the 3D portion where you walk along a tunnel that is spinning and a wobbly bridge. That was really cool. Again, more clowns so that was really weird. I hate clowns. The pitch black maze was pretty awesome. You run into the walls quite a bit, which adds to the fun because you have to feel your way around. Not to mention there might be some surprises around certain corners. \n\nIf this place was actually at Jacob Kell's house where he murdered all those people, at disturbing and scary that would be to be on the premises, I would say it's worth the $25. Otherwise, you should go on a thursday next time when it's back when you get a large student discount, or can go in a group of 4 to save more on admission. Heard a lot of people calling in to file complaints. Maybe we'll get our money back. The whole old saloon wild west theme that you walk into before getting to the nest also killed the mood for me. I guess to me, that made me realize it's not really a haunted house, but a staged one.  Oh yeah, the $5 parking fee sucked too. Didn't know we'd have to pay for that\n\nI'd probably have more fun if it wasn't so expensive and there wasn't a fake bomb threat. That's what we get for going on halloween I guess",681,2
"I'm a huge fan of TJ! So much so that I drive all the way from Greensburg to stock up on things. The employees are friendly and fun and seem to like their jobs. I find it much less overwhelming than Whole Foods and I appreciate that it is smaller with a limited assortment of high quality private label items. Make sure  you check sell by dates though!  \n\nI love the garlic hummus, whole grain pita chips, buffalo burgers, almond snack packs, coffee, cheese, frozen bell pepper blend, hemp protein powder and breads. It's a lot like Aldi in many ways BUT with organic healthy foods. I like that it doesn't take an entire pay check to feed my family unlike other grocery stores.\n\nALSO...be sure to check out the very bright nautical themed bathrooms.",170,3
I really enjoyed the calamari taco and brisket taco.The salsa was way too salty :( sadly. The plate came with a choice of 2tacos rice beans and cole slaw. I got rice only and my cousin did substitute the slaw for another side she picked the butter corn which was also good. We were a party of 4 and went on a Thursday night with no wait at 8.,81,2
"Spak Brothers is my favorite pizza.  I've eaten here dozens of times and each order is accurate and maintaining of the quality I expect.\n\nSpak Brothers pizza is excellent.  The dough is great, the sauce is great, and the toppings are fresh.  Spak seems to put a lot of effort in to the quality of the toppings.\n\nI also get Italian hoagies from them.  I like my hoagie meat crispy on the edges and Spak delivers.  The buns are also excellent.\n\nOverall a quality place.",120,4
"I give it 2 stars and Ill tell you why. I would give it 4stars for the interior. I like what they have going on, but it does make you expect something different. \nThey also have a great menu selection at really good prices. \n\nI ordered a salad that had a viagrette I really liked, other than that the salad was pretty blah. I could have made that at my house.\n\nThe chicken parmagana taste like a frozen entree from costco. The ravioli has a horrible flavor, they bring you bread and olive oil, which is fine but the olive oil is soo cheap and gross. Super bitter.\n\nThe portions a huge but who cares if the food isnt good. Its like a frozen food festival in there. \n\nA waste of a cool building and a great menu. Just poorly executed food.",182,1
"I love this place.   I was in town, but without my clubs, and I was able to rent more than a few for less than twenty bucks.  Decent driving range, great pro shop and the staff was incredibly nice and personable.  Helped me with all of my requests.  Prices for clothing in the pro shop were pretty good.",72,3
"It took 40 minutes for the food to get here, and when it did, they forgot my spring roll. Because of my hunger, I was willing to let that pass. Sadly, the food wasn't much better. In layman terms, the food was crappy. The fried rice tasted like rice mixed with some salt and a lot of pepper. The beef and broccoli tasted like fake beef and nasty broccoli covered in soy sauce. I am very disappointed. Never again. I'm sure there are many better alternatives to late night Chinese food.",112,0
"All hype and lacking delivery ;-( I really wanted to love the food after hearing so much for so long about this restaurant.\n\nThe wise guy needed more cheese and flavor for sure.\n\nThe margarita was good when we added the prosciutto. $6 more for prosciutto.\n\nNot worth the hour and a half wait, and most definitely NOT the best pizza in Phoenix.  Sorry, Pizzeria Bianco,  we won't be back.",95,1
"This is the best steak in the Las Vegas area, period!",14,3
"Was looking for somewhere to eat with my bf and saw this place and decided to try it out. My bf loves burritos so it wasn't to hard to sell him on this new place. \n\nI personally loved my super burrito, so fresh and cooked just right. The guac was tasty and the salsa was not overpowering the flavor of the carne asada. I enjoyed the tortilla also, as it was not thick like store bought ones. You got a little side of chips with the burrito and wish I would order more, next time! They where real tortilla chips and not overcooked. Maybe try some nachos?! \n\nFor a drink we both order some horchata. For us it was not very good, it had way to much cinnamon in it which just made it taste unappealing. Next time just go with a fountain drink. Also, that atmosphere was quiet and not very appealing to sit and eat in. I may just stop here on my lunch break and take it to go. \n\nOverall definitely a place to visit more often around work.",223,3
"We tried to like this place again tonight because although the last time we were in the yogurt wasn't the best the kid behind the counter , a bears fan was awesome but tonight was a different story! The kid behind the counter was horrible, when we asked for the peanut butter topping he stated it was in back & washed with 30 min before. Close we were surprised that he refused to go back & get it. Then much to our dismay when we got back to the hospital with our yogurt the Acai was spoiled, it was fermented & unedable! Do yourself a favor & never go there!",125,1
"Pizza Friday Lives!\n\nMy coworker gave me a coupon for Vito's, so we carried out a large pie around 6:00 p.m. last week. A large with sausage on only half (no topping on the other side) came out to be more than $16, WITH a coupon. Without a coupon, I see large plain pizzas start at $19. If you want to pile on more toppings, you'll be in for a hefty price!\n\nTo be fair,the pizza was DELICIOUS. We loved the cracker-thin crust, the ample amounts of their cheese mix and boyfriend said the Italian sausage was obviously homemade and exceptional. The hostess who took care of me was incredibly peppy and prompt. The place seemed pretty packed (wow, lots of P alliterations in there), so their food is certainly drawing crowds in. But it's just a *leetle* out of my price range for pizza. We can find pizza (sometimes two) with a salad to split for almost the same price.\n\nMy final say? I'd certainly nosh from there again, but only with a coup! Am I cheap? (The hostess didn't take mine so we hopefully we can reuse, woohoo!)",264,2
We visited for my 40th and were happy with the hotel.  The standard room was clean and had a decent view. It was great for the price. Center strip location is ideal for walking around the strip.,46,2
"Juicy Oysters and Oyster shooters!!\n\nService here is awesome!! Everyone is so friendly and nice, especially an asian guy named Ly. He gives wonderful service to every single customer. Having excellent attentive service makes the dining a much better experience for all. \n\nMust try the oyster shooter with I believe it's called Asian Bomb alcohol which is a mixture of sake and some other stuff which makes it taste so unique. It is soooo good!!! It will kick your butt without the alcohol taste. It's 3 for $12 I think but it's so worth it!!! \n\nOysters are fresh and delicious!! There's different kinds of oysters which Ly explained to us. I can't remember it of course, but there's a Japanese one and a southern one and blablabla. I tasted 2 different kinds and they were sooo good!! I love how it's already cut from the shell and ready to slurp. A must try!!!\n\nAlso tried seafood cioppino, shrimp appetizer, and steamed mussels. They were all very delicious as well. The shrimps are big here so it was really good. They put in some salsa-ish taste to the mussels while being steamed which makes it very juicy. \n\nGreat place to eat in Vegas if you're sick of the buffets. Definitely a must try in Vegas. The only problem you'll have is the price, but that's at any juicy oyster bar.",312,4
"My only qualm is the insecure doors. Do the ol' chair stack and you'll be fine. This place is literally a stone's throw from major locations on the strip, for 50 bucks a night.

Friendly staff and remarkably easy-in, easy-out experience, worthy of a 3/5 rating. We'll be coming back!",109,1

"I've been here twice, and I really enjoy it. \n\nI find that a lot of restaurants in Phoenix have issues with check-splitting; however, the wait staff here never has a problem with it and are extremely courteous and polite. \n\nI had the Murano Chick and Prosciutto sandwich and a side of mac and cheese. Both were good, although the mac and cheese could stand a little additional seasoning. The time before I had their risotto, which I thought was bland. Everything else I have tried has been delicious though. They have some good speciality cocktails and good specials each week.",127,3
"I'm really sad.\n\nThe people that once owned En Sushi have sold the business. So what was once a good quality, very affordable Japanese joint has been converted to yet another subpar neighbourhood sushi restaurant run by people who don't know Japanese cuisine.\n\nLet me give it to you straight. If see a menu that has rolls that have 12 ingredients on it, run far far far away. \n\nAlthough my husband and I didn't order any rolls, our companions did. The rolls were the circumference of the bottom of a coke can. Topped with all these ingredients, how can all the individual flavours come through? What was the chef thinking? Well, obviously, soaking it a dish of sauce is an obvious answer to this question. If it wasn't messy enough already, it sure was one hot messy meal then.\n\nThis is not sushi. I don't have a name for this atrocity but it certainly is NOT sushi.\n\nIf the legit-ness of this place didn't plummet right then and there, it hit the proverbial rock bottom when they served the paper thin slices of sashimi, cut incorrectly. Inside I'm cringing because we told our pals that this place was good.\n\nTempura was overly hard and thick and wasn't nearly as delicious as it was from my previous review. Plus they seriously cut down the portion sizes from my last review.\n\nAnd a final note, they no longer have the ongoing offers for free food either that I mentioned previously. Even if they did, we will not be returning.",337,1
"The associates are polite although maybe a bit pushy. But the wait times in this store are ridiculous. There's the greeter - who takes your name. Okay, that's fine. Then just wait - regardless of what you need. There are no cashiers to allow you to just grab and go. Don't bother popping in for a charger or a cover, which are overpriced anyway. The associate, after spending a ridiculous amount of time trying to upswell the customer before me, is finally ready. It's finally my turn. Then off to the greeter he goes to find out who is next - I know it's me because I've been waiting for almost an hour. I continue to wait as they stand there and chat for a while, which seems to be a common occurrence in this store. What could they possibly be discussing? Finally they walk toward me and, after introductions, I show him exactly what I want. He, of course, directs me to a more expensive phone. I advise him that I am purchasing an emergency phone for a 10-year-old. He takes the hint and leaves to retrieve the phone I originally requested. Upon his return he asks for my home phone info. I advise that I do not have a landline and he instantly breaks into his obviously rehearsed monologue about their home phone plan. Again, I point to the reason for my visit - an emergency phone for my son BECAUSE we don't have a landline. Finally off to the checkout counter. I foolishly inquire if the charger is included. Another rehearsed monologue about the amazing bundle he can offer with my 99 cent purchase before he finally admits that a wall charger is included with the phone. All said and done - an hour and a half to add a 99 cent flip- phone to my account. They really need to speed this up. I've purchased vehicles in less time.",396,1

I also noticed about 50-60 dirty glasses sitting on the back of the bar ...",132,1

"We came on a Friday around 2 pm. The line to check in was incredibly long, so much so that they were handing out free water bottles to everyone. Oh man, how I hated that line.\n\nHowever, the people that helped us were friendly and efficient! They made sure we got the accommodations we wanted (non-smoking, one bed) and even gave us a view of the strip from our room! No complaints there!\n\nThe room itself was just a-okay. Nothing special, but nothing to whine about. It had everything we needed, including a nice close-up mirror for doing my makeup in. I loved that. One plus star for that alone!\n\nThe price we paid was reasonable, especially for view we got. I'd definitely stay at TI again, though I'll most likely lean towards hitting up somewhere new next time.",183,3
"Today I had my first, of many I'm sure, visit to Metamorphosis. First of all, what a lovely studio! It is painted a calming mintish green and has dark wood accents. In the back, the walls are a beautiful plum color with the same dark wood. It is uncluttered and very clean with pleasing lighting.  My stylist was Lindsay, a very pretty,  personable, stylish young lady. Lindsay took a good amount of time talking to me about my hair; what I like about it, and dislike about it. She also made sure she understood how much time I like to spend on my hair on a daily basis and what sort of styling tools I use, have, or want to use. After making sure she understood what I hoped for...and explaining what she thought, she gave me an AMAZING shampoo/conditioning ahhhhh! Wow...felt so good! She cut and styled my hair, all the while providing me some excellent conversation,  and I walked out the door VERY pleased! I WILL be back!",214,4
"This place didn't look like that much to me, being in a mall and all, but boy was I wrong. \n\nFabulous dinner with a very knowledgeable and competent wait staff. The seafood, especially the oysters, were second to none. There wasn't a bad thing on the table, and with a decent sized group, we had lots of different items on the table. \n\nThe wine offerings were nice and also complemented the food very nicely. I was pleasantly surprised with the entire experience.",107,4
"I would have rated it higher, had i not had a problem with one of their soups. We went on monday night to this location since we happened to be in that part of the valley and it was past dinner time. So we used one of our coupons, making it 2 dinners for $23 total which included the overpriced drinks. I think they should make the drinks part of the meal price. \n\nWhat I hate about this new one, the way the salad bar is designed, it's almost impossible to get the middle items without crashing into the glass. This would work great for neanderthals, since they had super long arms. Or monkeys, since they can reach further than some of us humans. So to get some olives, you have to bend down and reach as far as you can, meanwhile your face is almost in your salad, and your hair probably is too. \nBad concept.\n\nThe restaurant is smaller, and I much prefer the Rainbow location or the Stephanie street one. \n\nI have never had a problem with any of the food exacting revenge on me before until the mushroom soup on monday night. My husband and I both had the same salad, side salads, side dishes, except we both had different soups. He hates mushrooms, but I love them. The soup pot was full, and I couldn't figure out why no one was eating it, and I got a cup. \nEverything was great,we enjoyed our meal, and 5 minutes after leaving the restaurant, I felt uncomfortably too full, bloated and felt like I'd better get to a restroom pronto. So stopped at a fast food place, and made it in the nick of time.\nLet's just say it was a rather gross unpleasant experience, one that I do not wish to relive in any way, ever!!!!!!!  And I will never ever eat at that location ever again for any reason. I will stick to the Rainbow location or the Henderson one if I ever go there again. Right now, I am afraid to.",425,2
"Will never go back, again! My mother-in-law & I visited the spa during \""Spa Week.\"" She had a massage and I had a facial. WORST facial ever. Not only did she not clean my face, but she rushed through the entire treatment and finished 12 minutes early. My skin did not feel any different the next day. My mother in law said that her massage was just okay. They do not do deep tissue and it's more of a light pressure massage. Go somewhere else!!",107,1

I didn't receive any onions.  \n\nMy son had the kid's mac & cheese which was quite large for a kid's meal.  He ate it all so I'm guessing he liked it.  \n\nI do have to say though that the chocolate cake dessert with a scoop of ice cream was REALLY good.

"This is the kind of brunch place to come to. The smell of fresh bread, friendly staff, and awesome menu. Seriously, put some pants on (even sweats will do) and wander over and wake up via taste buds. \n\nwhat i ate:\n- sweet potato and sausage hash: savory sausage paired with cubes of sweet potato, yummmmm. And the egg cook knows what s/he is doing cause my over medium eggs were just that (really really rare)! Came with two slices of bread that blew my mind. I feel sad for all those with a gluten allergy who can't enjoy taking a bite of lulu's bread\n- burrito (daily special): this was amazing! Everything was so flavorful and it all worked together so well. That salsa verde was out of this world! Definitely get this if it's on the daily special menu\n- ham + cheese tartine w/asparagus and hollandaise sauce (daily special): the ham was nice and salty, the cheese gooey and melted, the hollandaise.... omg the hollandaise sauce... it was so good it left me speechless. Again another dish I'd love to eat again\n\nPros:\n- FOOD!!!! Seriously everything I ate was so tasty. I want to go back to eat everything again!\n- service at the counter was friendly and helpful. there isn't waiter service but this cute brunch place didn't need it. Walk up to the counter, grab a menu, narrow down which dish you want (toughest choice of the day, hands down), and then grab a cozy booth or sit at any of the open tables\n- plenty of space! Even of a Saturday morning the place wasn't too crowded. They open up the doors to the adjoining pizza place, so you can venture in to grab a place to sit.\n\nCons:\n- too many yummy things on the menu! Seriously I couldn't decide what to order\n- bright! For those grabbing brunch after a long night of drinking, the crazy NV sun streaming in through the windows may make you want to bust out your sunglasses while sitting indoors\n- although I didn't have to wait for a table or wait long for the good, I wish there was waiter service\n\nWould I come again?

"I love this place! I first had Braddah's Island Style at this year's Bite of Las Vegas, trying the huli huli chicken taco and coconut bark. I was hooked and swore to myself that I'd have to come to the actual business.\n\nUntil last night, I kind of put it on the back burner, but finally, I grabbed a few friends and was surprised to find this place was not busy and bustling on a Saturday night. First of all, it is very clean, and there is plenty of dining space. We were greeted so warmly and offered samples upon arriving.\n\nI have to say, I was very satisfied with my dining experience. Like many describe it, Braddah's Island Style is basically a Chipotle but with a Hawaiian twist! I have a weak spot for quick, customizable food served this way... Anyway, I love their creativity and I find that many combinations go well together! Their salsas are amazing, the meat--juicy and full of flavor, the vegetables--fresh. You just can't go wrong with your order! After gobbling up all of our food, we were greeted once again; the enthusiastic customer service was the cherry on top of a great meal!\n\nI think this place has plenty of potential.

"Waited 45 minutes for an order that was supposed to take 10. Worst part wasn't the wait, the worst part was that with 5 people working the truck we were only given an update on our order 1 time, about 20 minutes into our wait. Mechanical problems are understandable, poor customer service is never excusable. After 45 minutes I asked for a refund, the lady taking the money asked the guy in the truck for the status of the order. He shrugged. I got my refund and moved on. They were also out of over half their menu items at opening time. Back to poor customer service. This is not a truck with it's act together.",146,0

"We visited The Asbury on 5/17/14 to enjoy a meal outside on the patio with our dog.  The waitress remembered us from when we passed by earlier in the day, which a subtle, pleasant touch. She brought out some water for the dog and the menus rather rapidly. We both ordered the cocktail with the lavender infused Tito's vodka and enjoyed them. Much of the menu was focused on brunch items and on this visit, we were solely focused on lunch so that limited our options. We decided on getting the burger with the $3 upgrade to include the fries and soup, and a beet salad. Then we finished our drink and did not receive a return visit for at least 15 minutes and the food took a while to come out. As we ordered our second drinks, I asked if I could get the Tito's on the rocks, I was told no since the only Tito's they had was infused for the special cocktail. We've not had that happen before, but okay, guess I'll get a Grey Goose. While we pondered if the meat was getting slaughtered and awaiting the delivery to the chef, we also wondered why they would serve a burger without fries. Does anyone only serve a burger alone on a plate that is not a slider or some amazing Kobe masterpiece? Clearly our thoughts took over due to lack of food. Everything arrived at once. The onion soup was the best item served.  He loved it as it was served and I thought that the soup tasted great but the ratio was off -- it needed more liquid/less cornbread and more onions. The burger itself was good but the bun tasted one or two days old. The fries were not crispy with some being undercooked and certainly not worth an upcharge. The beet salad was not very good. The beets were thick and tough, the lettuce had been dressed for too long and had too much dressing. The candied nuts were yummy, as were the strawberries. Overall we enjoyed ourselves and had fun people watching but I'm not sure this would be a restaurant we would come back too.",427,2
"The place:\nNon-descript strip mall location (why do all little ethnic places seem to occupy these out of the way locations?).  The inside is basically a few tables and a counter.  If I recall there was a TV on the wall?\n\nThe food:\nI tried the fantastic goat curry and was very pleased with the flavor and quantity.  As the side I ordered the fried plantains which were also quite good.  The \""spicy\"" rice was a little salty but good to soak up the curry sauce.\n\nThe bottom line:\nI would highly recommend the place if you'd like a taste of the Caribbean.",136,2
"Not impressed. I had not been here in a while but remembered as much better than it was tonight.  As I sit here my stomach hurts. We ordered a turkey burger, it was dry and had an odd taste combined with the taste of char (which was dominating). My husband got a mushroom burger, the mushrooms were so weird (chopped into nothing, clearly from a can and a sick yellow color). My daughters kids burger was all char no flavor.  Very disappointing.  We left most of our food, when the waitress came over she could see by the looks on our face that it was not going over well, she never offered anything.  Usually when most of the food except one or 2 bites are still on the plate that might trigger some alarm bells.",157,0

We went on a Thursday night and the place was slammin' - lots of fun and a great vibe.\n\nRe: Jason S. review:  I respect a restaurant that knows what it's good at and makes only that.

"Ordered take out when entertaining a guest with gluten sensitivity, and was not disappointed!  The Syrian Spicy Fish was tilapia expertly prepared and so flavorful.  It had a nice bit of heat and sweetness topped with walnuts and served with sweet almond rice.

And the hummus was delightful.\n\nWe can't wait to eat this again, and our next visit will be eat in.

"I had been wanting to try this place for so long.  It had everything I thought would make for a good meal- veggies, noodles, soupiness- but I left very disappointed.\n\nWe started off with a cucumber roll and that was a hot mess.  It was sloppily put together and not fresh at all.  If this is how they treat a cucumber, I don't want to know how they treat the fish.\n\nNext we ordered two Vegetarian Delights, I had the shabu shabu and my husband had the sukiyaki.  Note to vegetarians: when I see \""vegetarian\"" written somewhere, like a dummy I assume it's ok.  Thankfully at the last minute I asked about it and I was told they use bonito in the broth and sauce.  If you don't eat fish, ask to leave out the bonito.\n\nWell, basically all I got was water and a piece of seaweed.  I tried to put some of the condiments that are provided in the broth to liven it up, but gave up after my tenth tablespoon of soy sauce.  If you are going to go with the veggie, be prepared for zero flavor.  In the end, I ended up eating some plain boiled vegetables.\n\nMy husband's dinner was a little better since his veggies were saut\u00e9ed in sauce.  The downside was that I watched our server pour half a bottle of soy sauce in his pot.  I hope you like sodium!\n\nFor all the non-vegetarians, I'm sure this place is good.  \n\nFor all the vegetarians, you might want to consider something else.\n\nOverall, a fun experience to try once but it takes forever for small results.  Give me a giant bowl of ramen any day.",385,1

"After burger plans elsewhere fell through (I'm looking at you sign-less Planet Hollywood), I found myself at KGB again last night. \n*grumbles*\n ....It was just one of those nights where I was fully willing to indulge in some greasy goodness. Started our order off with the fried mac and cheese sticks. Holy crap, they were so amazing in that \""I know I'm totally going to regret this later, but it will all be worth it\"" sort of way. SO good. And after that I could care less if my burger ever came. \n\nMy previous visit wasn't a fluke, the burgers are pretty terrible. They've gone downhill. They're basically dried out pieces of crap that aren't the slightest bit juicy. Parts of it was chewy and pretty disgusting actually, like Walmart beef is used. In all honesty, I make better at home using burgers ordered from Omaha.\n\nThe cooks were quiet this time, but I was seated on the half booth/half table where you're completely on top of the party next to you and can hear every freakin' word they say.

So I assumed I had three good tires. Turns out that the tire I went down there to get fixed (the low one), was still on the car. And I was able to verify this because they never put air in the other two tires. \nCustomer friendly. But of course it's a shop trying to make money.

Two days later, the  tissue around my nail was swollen and extremely painful.  This infection around my cuticle required a doctor visit and antibiotics.  When I went back to show them my nail and  discuss this with management, I was surprised at how irritated they were with me.  I tried to be polite and non-confrontational, because I am sure that the nail business must be challenging and mistakes can happen.  I  hoped that they would be reminded to be more careful and adjust their hygeine, however, they could not even entertain the idea that  their work had anything to do with the infection that I had.  When I told them that I had been seen by a doctor who confirmed an infection and gave me antibiotics, they told me that a doctor could not help me and suggested that I wrap my finger in onion to draw out the infection. \nUltimately, their unteachable attitude was as disappointing as the manicure I received there.\n\nIf you go there, I hope your experience will be like my first time there.",281,0

"This place was pretty empty but we were dining on a Sunday night.. We made a reservation on opentable and got there in 15 min ! Since the main entrees were a little pricey, we opted to share some of the appetizers so that we could get a better taste of more dishes... for the 2 of us, we ended up ordering the gumbo, crab salad, margharita pizza, lobster Mac n cheese and BBQ ribs. My favorite was the Mac and cheese cooked to just the best temperature, cheesy heaven more lobster would have been good but overall satisfying! The ribs with pickled corn was also very good! Not too fatty or oily meat fell off the bone easily. Thecrab sale was also very fresh although it wasn't tossed well because some parts were extra salty.  The gumbo was ok had much better elsewhere.. The pizza was the worst, it was jusT WAY too oily, it was drenched in oil and the cheese was just barely melted, not browned. it was so oily i could only take a few bites :( wouldn't get that again .

"Solid 3.5 stars.  \n\nWe hadn't dined at a Firefly in at least a couple of years so what the heck.  I actually prefer the atmosphere of this one over Paradise.  High ceilings, less cramped and more parking space.  \n\nThe menu hasn't changed much from what I remember but I did notice a couple of things like the lobster corn dogs and lobster \""escargot style\"" so we got those at $10 a plate.  The corn dogs were the only disappointing dish of the night.  The breading was not good and it was kinda soggy.  The escargot lobster was tasty.  I suppose anything cooked escargot style would be.  \n\nAside from the usuals like bacon wrapped dates, empanadas (pork is better than the vegetarian) and sliders, we went with our waiter's one suggestion of the warm spinach salad.  Glad we did that!  Who knew warm wilted spinach with pine nuts, roasted peppers and artichoke would be so good??  I think whatever dressing they had going on knocked it out of the park.

"Stopped by here yesterday to try some new tennis racquets before I purchase. \""Ski Country Sports\"" does not scream tennis to me, but thanks to the banner hanging outside the place saying \""TENNIS\"" and reviews on Yelp, I checked it out. The staff was knowledgeable and provided some great inside. You can also demo each racquet prior to purchasing. If you're on a budget, they do sell demos after all the inventory has been sold. $2/racquet to rent as many as you like. I took out 3 and bought some balls. Bags, clothing, etc all there for you. Much other stuff too, though I didn't venture past the tennis stuff this trip. Will do so next time.",150,3

"Bei Sport Gulyas habe ich schon das dritte Paar Laufschuhe gekauft. Nachdem meine Fu\u00dfstellung begutachtet wurde, empfahl man mir einen Schuh mit st\u00fctzender Wirkung. Der Brooks GTS 11 sollte es sein. Ich wurde gebeten die Schuhe anzuziehen und die Stra\u00dfe rauf und runter zu laufen, damit mein Laufverhalten beobachtet werden kann. \n\nGesagt getan. Die Schuhe passten gut zu mir und meinem Laufstil. Mir wurden noch einige Tipps gegeben zwecks Armhaltung und Laufgeschwindigkeit. Und so habe ich sie gekauft. Ich bekam noch ein paar Laufsocken geschenkt. Das war jetzt schon einige Jahre her. \nUnd wenn ich neue Schuhe gebraucht habe bin ich wieder hin. \n\nIn einem Sozialen Netzwerk konnte ich von einem R\u00e4umungsverkauf von Asics Schuhe lesen.

"Really disappointed in 24 Hour Fitness. I've been a customer for 3-4 years and after a few experiences with some of the trainers and clientele, I've decided that leaving the club and going with another gym that is actually closer to work and home was a better option. I tried cancelling my membership on Friday at this location and was advised it would take a manager, between the hours of 8-5 to do so otherwise I could go online anytime to cancel. \n\nThis weekend, Sunday, I decided to go ahead and cancel my membership and when visiting the 'cancel membership' link on my login- it directed me to call an 866 number. 1) Don't direct me to a site when you know it's going to make me call a # 2) I called the number and sat on hold for 20+minutes with no response.\n\nI hung up to call back my Dobson 24 Hour fitness location to talk to member services. I told the young lady the issues I had - my schedule doesn't permit me to come into the location between the hours, the site doesn't allow for cancellation and the number has had me on hold for 20+ minutes- Why couldn't I cancel my membership without a manager when I've clearly signed up for my membership without one, and have changed my billing multiple times without one. Her response, \""You can ask corporate when you call and get through to them.\""\n \nYou could say I more than perturbed at this point with the customer service. I was a fan of the gym for awhile but the customer service as a whole is less than par and distills why I am taking my business else where.",362,1
"Had my first twin peaks experience last weekend. Here's my review:\n1. \""Scenic Views\"" - Excellent!  The girls are hot and also personable (at least our waitress was personable).  I joked with my friends that they must recruit at eating disorder clinics as the only chunky girls or girls with any fat or cellulite in the place were customers. The waitresses here stop to chit chat with their customers not just drop off food and drinks and run.  \n\n2.  Sports watching: Good.  Lots of TVs ring the bar. we were there to watch Sunday NFL games and all 5 of us have different favorite teams and we were all able to see a TV from our table that had our respective games on them.  Of course you're only getting sound from the big draw game going on but that's everywhere.\n\n3.  Food:  Average/Fair: Nothing memorable, and not a very big selection of food offerings.  The waitresses, who BTW are very good promoters & up-sellers of their food and products, definitely make the limited menu items sound better than they actually were. Not that the food was disappointing or bad, it was just a little over exaggerated/oversold. I and a couple others had hangover burgers which is an average burger with a fried egg on it,  Burgers comes with fries which are the thick steak fry kind and they are seasoned. For the price it would've been nice if it had a couple more topping options were offered with the burger, but how it came out was adequate. My friend had the Philly cheese steak which I had part of.  Now a disclaimer: I'm from Philly originally so rarely do I give a cheese steak outside of the Philly/NJ?NY area a positive review because so often they are missing one or more important parts of what makes a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Twin Peak's version was no exception...I'd call it a decent cheese steak but not a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Another friend had the pork nachos which were good. We had to send something back to the kitchen (not me) due to temperature not being warm enough, but that was quickly rectified  \n\n4. Beer: Good! Had their Hefeweizen which was cold and tasty. \n\nOnly negative was when the bill for me and my girlfriend's portion came, the waitress had my GF down for 3 big beers instead of the 2 beers she actually ordered. When I brought this to the waitress' attention, she first tried to convince me that she was almost 100% positive my GF had ordered that many beers, however my GF is tiny and she would've been on the floor if she had that many beers in that short amount of time.  Finally the waitress had her manager remove the unordered beer from the bill, but was kind of surprised the waitress argued with us initially.  \n\nSo I'd go back for the beers, game watching & scenic views.  I'll probably eat elsewhere though before I go.",640,2

The Gyro Pita could have been on a children's menu... not only was it small, but the amount of Gyro was non existent. They basically filled the tiny pita with spoiled (brown) romaine lettuce and tomato.  They served this with a side of 10 french fries and a drink and charged roughly 10 dollars for the meal.

"The chocolate factory is just...blah. You don't see much of the chocolate. There aren't any chocolate waterfalls, Oompa Loompas or anything even remotely entertaining. It's maybe a 30 foot long walk way with windows to one side that showcase a few workers in an assembly line setting and a tiny peek of chocolate on the conveyor belt. \n\nAt the end of the walk way stands a young woman behind a counter with three different chocolate coins. Milk chocolate, white and dark. I didn't expect her to be excessively cheerful, but a little pep and holiday cheer wouldn't have been unreasonable to anticipate. She stood there with a rather ominous air. As if, she'd rather drown herself in an imaginary chocolate river than serve another piece of FREE chocolate. Yes, FREE chocolate. Although, if you consider the wasted 2 mins and 48 seconds it took to get through the factory, then you really should ask for another piece...maybe four. \n\nYou then move on to a large Ethel M retail store where seeing the rows and mounds of different chocolates through the glass display is far more exciting than the factory. Ornately wrapped boxes in several sizes are stacked fashionably on every table and counter. But, I hope you're Daddy Warbucks; or at the very least not a penny pincher, if you have any plans to actually purchase some chocolate here. The cheapest box I could find was $22.00 and smaller than your standard Christmas card.\n\nSpeaking of Christmas...the real attraction is the Cactus Garden. It's absolutely FREE to walk through and there is lots to see. A maze of pathways lead you through a park of several different species of cactus that are covered in wonderful Christmas lights. My 5 year old was especially impressed by the large blowup lawn decorations. \n\nYou'll find Santa sitting under a beautifully lit gazebo with 1 elf, 2 plain clothed dudes who operate the camera, 1 guy who sells the Santa pictures and a Partridge in a pear tree. The picture is $15 bucks each, without the flimsy frame and they only accept CASH. Also, the nearest ATM is at the gas station on Mountain Vista and Sunset, which requires a drive as the factory is tucked at the very end of a long side street.  \n\nThe Cactus Garden is definitely worth a look. However, I'm not sure it'd be much fun without the Christmas lights unless you were an aspiring botanist.",521,2

"I am not experienced with BBQ so take that into account when you read this review.  I came here yesterday for take out.  I got two dinner combos--a Georgia chopped pork with the sides of Wilbur beans and garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  The other combo was a Texas beef brisket with sides of potato salad and Dave's cheesy mac and cheese.  Both came with a corn  bread muffin.\n\nWe enjoyed the dinner, perhaps because it was a different kind of meal for us.  It was quick.  I didn't call the order in but went there and ordered at their To Go section.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Customer service was very good and I was soon on my way.\n\nThe only thing I regret is all the plastic used for take out.  Some recyclable, some not.  I think another time, I'd just go and eat there rather than bring home so much that will end in the landfill.\n\nI'll be back but I need to try some of the other BBQ places in town including one recommended highly by Nelson Q.  He never steers me wrong.",239,2
"I'm sad that I have to write this update about GVR because I really love this hotel. I've stayed here aprox 5 times and it just seems that the Customer Service is getting worse each time I visit. \n\nI booked my room 4 months in advance with a request that I needed 2 queen beds since there were going to be 3 adults staying in the room. When we get to check in, I was informed that there were NO 2 queens available and that we would have to settle for a King Room with a roll-a-way bed. This was unacceptable to me and I had asked to speak to a Manager. Donna (The Front Desk Manager) said that there was nothing that she could do for me, that the hotel was completely booked with a Children's Basketball Team in town.\n\n I knew that my girlfriends and I would be spending the entire day poolside so I asked her if there was any way that she could accommodate us with a Cabana for Saturday with a discounted price (Cabanas are $200 rental fee + $150 food and drink min) she then preceded to tell me that she couldn't do that and that ALL the cabana's were already rented out for Saturday. THAT WAS A FLAT OUT LIE!!!! I spent the entire Saturday by the pool and out of all the Cabana's they had, 3 were being used. Donna, not once tried to correct the situation or satisfy the customer. Not even buffet comps!!!! Instead I get one bed and a fee for a roll-away that I did not want in the first place!!!\n\nAnother problem I had was with the service at the cafe inside the casino. After being seated, it took 20 min for someone to acknowledge us. Our server, who's name is Adrian seemed like he didn't like his job and was just there because he had to be. Not friendly, not helpful, never came around to see if we needed anything, never gave us refills on our water. It was just a total disappointment. I did inform the Manager Mark regarding our service and he did offer to comp our breakfast the next day but we were just so fed up with the service we were getting by the GVR employees that we just decided to drive down to the M Resort for breakfast the next day (BTW, excellent service at the M Resort) \n\nThere was only one GVR employee that was extremely pleasant, very helpful and actually seemed to like her job and her name was Mindy. She is one of the servers that works the pool area. EXCELLENT SERVICE BY MINDY!!!! \n\nI am extremely disappointed with this trip to GVR and will be thinking twice about staying here in November. I may be giving M Resort my business from now on.",582,1

"I read about Ramen Tatsu in today's Review Journal, in Wednesday's \""Taste\"" section. I'd been craving some authentic Japanese ramen for a few days, so Mark and I thought we'd give it a try. I was really looking forward to the tonkotsu ramen. Tonkotsu is a pork based broth that is very time-consuming to make; the southern Japanese island of Kyushu is probably the capital of tonkotsu ramen, and I've had the real thing many times.\n\nChef Wayne Kageyama's tonkotsu did not disappoint; it was not as rich as the shiru (soup) that I became accustomed to in Fukuoka, and it had a decidedly smoky flavor that I didn't expect but was most pleasantly surprised by. The tonkotsu ramen was the only menu choice to offer the thin noodles that I prefer, and the smokiness of the broth was an excellent foil for the kimchi that I ordered extra as a topping. The very generous portion quite sated me; I had no reason or desire to order extra noodles or soup.\n\nMark ordered the shoyu ramen, which came with the thick noodles. The garlic chips that he ordered were a little overpowering, but the broth was delicate and not too salty at all.\n\nWe ordered a side of gyoza (better known to Americans as \""pot stickers\"") and a side of takoyaki - small dough balls filled with pieces of octopus and topped, usually, with a sweet teriyaki type sauce, Japanese mayonnaise and shredded or powdered nori. \n\nThe gyoza were delightful; well-stuffed, fried perfectly and then quickly steamed in the pan to offer a contrast of crunch and chew. They brought back fond memories of sake-soaked late nights in mom-and-pop shops that abound in the back alleys of Osaka, trying to stave off the next morning's inevitable hangover, heh heh. \n\nOsaka is famous for takoyaki, and unfortunately I found Tatsu's to be a small disappointment in an otherwise exceptional and very authentic meal. There was not enough octopus, and the the sauce that topped them off was almost sweet enough to make them a dessert. I must admit though, I did eat all of them!\n\nI highly recommend this comfortable and clean restaurant for an authentic and reasonably priced adventure into Japanese cuisine. Chef Kageyama is very affable; the staff, who are all Japanese, are pleasant and efficient, and more than willing to overlook the errors in my Japanese, which has become a bit rusty of late.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a strip mall on the east side of South Jones, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn; parking is not a problem. Beer (served ice-cold), wine, and hot and cold sake are available. Major credit cards are accepted. Dessert is conspicuously absent from the menu, but there IS a Baskin-Robbins right across the street, should you feel the need for something sweet afterward. If this review convinces you to try Ramen Tatsu out, please give a \""hello\"" to chef Kageyama from me -the \""gaijin\"" from Osaka!",658,3

In regards to the food I did not think it was that great. The beans taste like can beans and not like authentic mexican beans and the rice was a little too dry, it did not really taste fresh.  I got a few tacos and the meat was not that good, it seemed to be overcooked and to dry. It almost tasted as if it had been there all day just kept warm and they just keep reheating it up.

"\""All You Need Is Love.\"" - John Lennon\n\nMirage spending a lot marketing this show; you can see a huge Beatle Love Logo from their Hotel.  After all, they invest like 100 millions in innovation the stage.  These stages used to be the iconic Siegfried & Roy Magic show with the white lions and tigers.   One of the big cost of the new stage is in fact all 2,000 seat have an individual speakers placed in the back.  That feature help bring the sound balance in all seats.  In addition, the stage can be open and close just like other Cirque du Soleil, except no water in this one.  However, a lot of perfume foggy effect, and many high-tech lighting systems.\n\nThe entrance to the show was nicely done; it felt like you walk to an upscale nightclub.  The show is a lot more about the music, is really the heart and souls of the Cirque Du Soleil acrobat performers.  Performer of all ages were part of the show, some stunts does not look like it had any safety strap despite been like over 100 feet in the air.  The best act I think was the Come Together, that act was flawless it require perfect timing between several performer. That song was a great fit of the act.  Not every act was excellent, but there more than a few dozen would wow you.\n\nThis is my first time watching Cirque Du Soleli, and I am definite a fan of them.  Looking forward to see the famous water show like O and Le Reve.  I basically got this show for free view the special hotel reservation promotion.  The shows tickets value were higher than our hotel stay in the Monte Carlo.  At top of that, our seat were been upgrade from balcony to second row !",378,4
Good food and very clean but a bit pricey. So so overall.,15,3
"I have been here a few times and each time I have been there I have had great food and service.I'm glad that I finally have some good Chinese food nearby. My last visit I had the family special ($9.95/person, 2 or more people)and loved their wor ton soup. It comes in a big bowl tha fills up 4 of the individual soup plates and it is soo tasty. The veggies are still crisp and crunchy as they should be. The staff is always friendly.",106,4
"We've seen four other Cirque shows and I must say this is one of the best.  I wasn't a crazy fan of Michael Jackson, but always enjoyed his music.

This is a great hospital for solving complex medical problems but security is a problem.  \n\nMy friend's iPad was stolen while she was sleeping in the middle of the night. \n\nAn iPad is a reasonable thing to bring to the hospital to pass the time.

"Today is a beautiful day. Bright and sunny skies. I walked into this little French-Vietnamese restaurant hoping for some decent food. It is definitely filled with plenty of college students. I ordered the Charbroiled Banh Mi - #36. It came out warm with what seems like only a few vegetables and pork. Unfortunately, I was correct. However, for $3.50, you get what you paid for. The sandwich was okay, not impressive. This is in a university area, so perhaps their target audience are poor college students. Don't expect anything great. Only expect food to be ready and cheap. \n\nService- almost nonexistent\nCleanliness -great\nFood -meh\nDecor -cool.",154,1
"Wow, just wow.\n\nI decided to try the Luxor as a friend of mine had suggested it.  I had not been here in quite a number of years, and decided it was time to give them a try.  I requested a 3-night stay.\n\nAs I check in at the front desk, I was offered an upgrade to a tower suite room for an extra $20, which I thought was a good deal.  This was in the new towers (not the older pyramid) in the existing resort.  I was very anxious to see these new rooms, as this was supposed to be a new renovation the Luxor completed.  The last time I stayed in this hotel was about 6 or 7 years ago, so it looked totally different now.\n\nAfter check-in and receiving my room key, I had one HELL of a time finding the elevators.  This was bar none, the most confusing arrangement I had ever seen. -- Even other guests were asking ME for directions to THEIR elevators...  Pathetic..  Finally, after asking two casino people, they were able to escort me to the proper elevator.  Now, as they were doing so, I counted 9 (nine) different turns down various passageways.  I was so spun around, I didn't know which way was up after being  brought to the correct elevator door.  This place is like a MAZE unlike anything imaginable...\n\n...Now I finally reach my floor.  After getting off the elevator, I noticed several different hallways going off into different directions...  Yep, you guessed it, NO signs indicating which rooms were down which hall, either...  Well, after some poking around and wasting maybe 5 more minutes trying to find where to go, I finally found my room!\n\nSo, I put my key into the door, unlocked, and went inside...  That's when the fun started....\n\nSo, what did I see when I opened my hotel room??\n\nThere was this old guy sitting on the bed, in his underwear, T-Shirt, holding a TV remote control in his hand, staring me up and down....\n\nThe guy, VERY surprised, asked me \""Ummmm?....  Who the HELL are you?!!!\""...\n\nI was about to ask the same question...\n\nI was like \""This was supposed to be MY room, sir...\""...   The guy told me that him and his wife were not supposed to check out until Friday!....  W-T-F!??\n\nYep, something was really screwed up, BIG TIME!\n\nI apologized to the guy and told him I would sort it out with the front desk..\n\nSo, down the elevators and into the maze I went marching back to the front desk.\n\nI told the Luxor desk clerk what happened.  She just said, \""Oh, sorry, we THOUGHT that room was already vacant\""....\n\nNope, there was an old guy sitting in his underwear watching TV and he was supposed to be there until Friday, I said...\n\nThey acted like it wasn't any big deal.  That was until I told them to cancel my reservation and refund my money.  Now, the manager comes over and tells me he would make things right by offering me a \""free upgrade\"".\n\nI told him that would not do, as I didn't like the layout of the hotel and had a very funny feeling about the place.  I told the manager that the hotel signage sucked, and the layout and design was beyond bad...  He seemed very disturbed by my comments, and just said, \""OK, then, that's the best we can do\""..  Anyway, I had to insist two more times for a refund before they would finally process it.  They were trying like hell to keep me from canceling.\n\nSave your time and money.  This place does not have it together.",846,0

"My family and I went to the restaurant for a \""Dine-In\"" experience on November 7, 2009.  We arrived at 6:15.  It took over 45 minutes for my family to receive their order.  There were only 3 other customers in the restaurant so a busy restaurant was not the problem.  It took over 20 minutes for the waiter to notify me that one of the items on the menu was not available.  My barbeque ribs were overcooked and it was not a full rack unless the pig was named \""Wilbur\"" and was from Charlotte's Web.  It was more like 3/4 of a rack of ribs.  There was barely any sauce on the overdone ribs.  Food has a grade of C+ (and I'm being generous).\n\nKitchen Help - during our stay at the establishment I noticed one thing,  the kitchen help was of no help at all. Several times I noticed the kitchen help coming out the back service door to help themselves to the soda fountain.  It was not just one but two or three individuals that came out multiple times.  When I was leaving the restaurant, it all became clear to me. There were probably about 5 or 6 people in the kitchen, and maybe one or two were working.  Several girls were staring through the kitchen door observation window out to the parking lot where one of the employees was smoking a cigarette and checking out one of the cars parked in the dirt.  Most of the employee's cars were parked in such a haphazard way that it looked like a high school drive-in more than a respectable restaurant.  One employee is certainly active because he was also one of the ones that kept helping himself to the soda at the fountain.  It also doesn't help that the male kitchen help were not clean-shaven.  The kitchen help gets a grade of D- (I've seen worse and that's why it's not an F).\n\nService - I would have to say this was the only bright spot in the whole experience.  Our waiter, busted his butt to make sure our dining experience was good.  I know he was covering for the kitchen help because he was very apologetic and seemed frustrated at times with what was going on in the kitchen. I give him a grade of A.\n\nMy final thoughts:  I have done more than my share of restaurant work in my youth and I have been in the Customer Service field for over 20 years.  This experience was not a good one.  On the website I'm sure Sam Rosati would not stand for this kind of kitchen help or quality of food that I experienced on Saturday November 7, 2009.  Since the restaurant is not in the best of locations, it will have to survive by word of mouth.  It is not going to survive for very long with kitchen help and food like I experienced.\n\nRuss\n\np.s.  I'm not sure about those earlier ratings of 4 stars because this particular Rosati's was not open during 2008.",661,0
"Writing a review about this place is kind of like writing a review about a dentist. Historically in the 1700s, barbers/stylists were also dentists and surgeons. Get a cut and extract a tooth. Thank goodness I do not need dental work, but I had to make a difficult decision of selecting a place since my guy retired. That put me in shock since I've been with the man for years. We've built a bond. Why do you think Lebron James flies his barber with him as he travels.  \n\nSo I enlisted yelp's help, and let me just say, you pay for what you get. That's a powerful statement if you appreciate bang for your buck. If you are just looking for a cut and be on your way, you may not get to value the time it takes to educate in the art of styling. \n\nNext, the atmosphere. I'm not one to frolic in a spa setting, but I do appreciate being in a nice place versus a place I might contract lice from uncleanliness. So Fino fits the category of the former. I'm also more of a man's man. I enjoy the locker room feel of this place. It's like undressing at the gym after a workout, hot shower, sit in your towel naked  and watch ESPN for 10-15 minutes while your body recovers. It's relaxing! I do not need to feel any tension with the presence of women prancing around curling/coloring/straightening their hair and having their nails done. \n\nBravo Fino! Job well done and branding well done.",345,4
"Susihi was ok. Seemed not as fresh as other sushi places I have been to. Special/baked/deep fried rolls were below average in taste and quality. Service was good for the first fifteen/twenty minutes, but for some reason the waitresses and waiters completely stopped coming to our table. We would stare down the staff and I'd even motion them over and no response. If you want great service for half the time and below average sushi, this is the place for you.",102,1
"Awesome breakfast burritos. They're huge and have the perfect combination in each bite. We loved how you could pick from multiple hot sauce flavors. My burrito was the bacon, egg, cheese and potato.

"Me love long time.  This is without a doubt my favorite dive bar in all of Vegas.  The bartender is darn friendly and accommodating, and the beer selection is monstrous.

While not particularly healthy or gourmet, it's solid, yummy bar grub.  \n\nIf you're playing, they actually hook it up and take care of you here.  I'm looking forward to coming back soon.",115,4
"My husband and I came here this morning. It's a cute little restaurant but I found it rather dark in there. My husband had the carne asada crepe (can't remember the exact name) with guacamole, tomato sauce, Monterey jack cheese, and I had the Sunday morning crepe with scrambled eggs, potatoes, and cheese. My husband's crepe was soo delicious! We both loved it! Mine was good too but lacked a bit in flavor. I kinda wished I the one my husband got, lol. He also got the watermelon juice and loved it! I got the mango mimosa which was also delicious but I thought it was going to have juice in it with the champagne. It was more of a champagne with mango flavor. Overall, it was a great little restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. The service was also excellent and the workers were friendly. We will definitely be back again!",182,3
"We waited 20 minutes without ever seeing our server and during that time it took more than ten minutes for a busser to get our waters to the table.

"We arrived without reservation, but luckily grabbed a table for two by the bar. This restaurant is tastefully decorated and not lacking for details. Out server greeted us and let us know the sommelier was present should we have any questions. This a tapas-style restaurant and our server suggested 2-4 plates a person. The two of us shared three plus a bottle of wine and dessert and were definitely satisfied. Our first two plates were a variety of five tomatoes with truffle oil and the duck and arugula. Both were absolutely fantastic! To follow we had the beef cheek. I dont have words to describe this dish. The beef was melt-in-your mouth delicious while the sauce it came with begged to be sopped up by bread which soon followed - two types to be precise. \nOur dessert (although not necessary) was a strawberry shortcake. This dish was just ok, but it did have to follow those beef cheeks. I would have had those for dessert.\nOverall, I would recommend this restaurant, but be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment.",220,4
"I've had all kinds of dishes here from the Enchantment platter to the tequila shrimp to the lobster linguine special.

Take that as you will. \n-Portions are generous, come hungry!\n-Anything involving lobster or a cream sauce here is a winner\n\nCons:\n-Anything involving non-seafood meat is dry or overcooked in my book\n-I personally like higher sauce/veggie-to-meat ratios, but they usually pack their food full of MEAT\n\n:) Still love you Tavern.

"I've been making an annual trip to Vegas for about the past 20 years (I keep trying to figure out what it is that \""happens in Vegas\""...so far, no idea :-).  I have been thru the Luxor previously, and had even briefly (uh-hum) seen the inside of one of their Pyramid Rooms until last week, when I actually stayed in one.  I will say that the rooms are \""cool\"", with their sloping windows, huge atrium (that you walked across to get to/from the \""inclinators\"" which are now just called \""elevators\"").  My room had a view over the pool area, a comfortable bed, an older style wall a/c unit that kept my room comfortable, and a shower but no bathtub.  The shower was nice and big, but the bottles of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel kept sliding off the soap dish onto the floor, so I ended up just leaving them on the floor!\n\nAll in all, I was satisfied with my room, even without a refridgerator in it!  However, in the morning, I was awaked to the sound of hammering and sawing taking place, apparently a couple of floors above the room I was staying in (on the 13th floor).  The construction noise persisted, so I called the front desk who were very accommodating and arranged for me to move to one of their tower rooms.  The tower room was great, had an awesome view of the Excaliber Hotel next door (I felt like I was living in a fairytale)!  I really liked how the Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay to the South, and to Excaliber to the North, with moving walkways and various shops/restaurants/bars all along the way.  I got plenty of cardio in, and got to sample some alcohol at Minus 5, and some Krispy Kreme doughnuts an the food court area of Excalibur.  What shocked me the most was seeing the lines of people at McDonalds (in the Luxor & Excalibur)!  Really people, you go to Vegas and line up to eat at McDonalds???\n\nAnyway, the Luxor is a cool hotel, true it's not the newest hotel on the strip, but they are renovating the rooms in the Pyramid, and my room in the West Tower was great.  Only odd thing, the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub (which I was excited to try out), but I discovered that the hotel had disabled all of the jacuzzi tubs in the resort.  Nobody would tell me why, I'm guessing the reason might be \""shocking\""!",539,3
"Oooh! A fancy steakhouse!....Cynthia likes!! =) Ruth Chris is located on the second level of Harrah's casino level. If you ever get lost or have no idea where to find the elevators that would take you up to Ruth Chris, don't hesitate to ask an employee. Parked his car in valet because it was quick and convenient. \n\nThis place isn't cheap....the two of us ran the bill to about $200.00. But of course, appetizers, soup and salad and wine were ordered as well as our entrees + side dishes.\nI ordered the lobster bisque soup while my date ordered a wedge salad.\n\nLOBSTER BISQUE SOUP: My soup was delicious. Although...I think they used a mushroom based broth (if that makes any sense) because I don't like mushrooms and I can recognize that distinct mushroom taste. And it was certainly in my soup. Yucky but it wasn't unbearable.\n\nPETITE FILET MIGNON: The petite is 8 oz. and the larger size is 11 oz. My date and I both ordered the 8 oz. and it was PERFECT sized. OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!! The flavoring and seasoning they cooked their steaks with were perfect! Even though I ordered my filet (and any steaks) WELL DONE...it wasn't dried at all. Each bite completely melts in my mouth. You can tell the quality here is ON POINT.\n\nNOTE: Your steaks and any other entrees do not come with any other side dishes. So if you want mashed potatoes or veggies....you gotta order it. Each dish is more than enough to share between two grown adults.\n\nPOTATOES AU GRATIN: I'm a sucker for all potatoes. So potatoes with cheese melted on top? UMMM....THIS is like an orgasm in my mouth!!!! Amazing side dish! Must order if you're in love with potatoes like me.\n\nSAUTEED SPINACH WITH GARLIC: Don't be afraid of the garlic...there was only a small hint of the taste. Definitely not strong enough to leave any garlic breath.\n\nService was great the entire night. They were attentive to our drinks and kept checking back on us throughout the night to see how everything is going. The dessert menu was offered at the end of our meals but we were just too full. He recommended the banana cream pie? Sooo....perhaps you can give that a try?  \n\nAlso, this is a fancy restaurant. My date and I were dressed to the nines but I did see a couple people in very casual attire. Come on guys. Please dress the part. Don't come to a $$$$ steakhouse and wear something that belongs to a $ establishment.",586,4
"Having a last minute trip to Vegas, I decided to book it through hostelbookers for a cheap night stay in Vegas.  Since I was going in 2 days, all the rooms in Vegas were super expensive due to the Mayweather fight that weekend.  All the regular hotels were $100 ~ $125/night for the older hotels (Luxor, Excalibur, etc), I decided to try this out.\n\nIt was about $90 with taxes included for a one night stay (which was discounted from the regular price of $150).  I thought originally this was going to be a hotel/hostel place, since it was listed on hostelbookers but instead they were just renting out rooms using the hostelbookers website instead.  \n\nAfter checking in towards the early evening hours, there was no issue. The only requirement I told the staff at the registration desk was that I wanted a NON SMOKING room, I emphasized this a couple times before getting my room key.  The person said that it was non smoking for sure, so I proceed to the room (which was located in the same building as the registration desk).  \n\nWhen I got into the room, it smelled like cigarettes.  It was quite nasty, as I had a previous stay somewhere else where I got a smoking room, after sleeping there, the next morning, I smelled like cigarettes.\n\nI went back to the front desk to tell them that and they told me it was supposed to be a non smoking room and there was a sign clearly on the room door saying that.  Apparently, someone didn't really give a shit and smoked in there anyways.    I don't blame them, since they don't clean the rooms, they probably didn't know it smelled like that.  The cleaning staff should of done a better job cleaning it or converting that room into a smoking room. That was a mishap on that end.\n\nI managed to get the room exchanged to the adjacent building across the way, next to the parking lot.  This room was a lot better than first one.  It smelled like a regular room and it was clean.  One issue I had was that the bed lacked a thick enough blanket. It was quite thin and when you have the A/C on, it gets cold after a while when your sleeping. \n\nAlso, the position of the ACs for each room is located in the hall as you walk towards your room.  If it's on, you get this stream of hot air blasting your feet before reaching your room.  Imagine having 10 units on at the same time (which was a bit warm that weekend), all this hot air coming at you after driving for 8+ hours. \n\nIn addition to  having the AC that low towards the wall, when you sleep, the AC is blasting right in your face.  It might be fine for some folks, but I prefer to have it higher up, so my face doesn't get blasted all night.  You can easily get sick from having it that way as well.  I don't think I'll be coming back to this place, it was pretty ghetto.  The price for this place should be more under $50 for what your getting.  I did enjoy the free ice though and the plentiful amount of parking in the back!",709,1
"Johnny Mac's is a strip mall restaurant/bar one could drive by without even noticing- but you should take notice.  Most of the items we've had at Johnny Mac's have been fantastic and reasonably priced.  Another thing that makes this place is great is that it's smoke free.  Believe me, when you first walk in, you expect a cloud of smoke.\n\nIf you're going for draft beer, consider the $10.50 pitcher to share.  It is a good deal and priced better than buying individual pints.\n\nTonight we had the Beef on Weck special.  If you are not familiar with this Buffalo, NY specialty, it's thin cut roast beef on a toasted kimmelweck roll with a side of au jus.  Johnny's serves it with fries and a pickle.  I've now had this dish twice, and both times it was fantastic.  The meat could be a little rarer, but it is definitely tender and flavorful.  But, to me, this sandwich is all about the roll.  It makes the sandwich superb.\n\nWe also had the wings tonight, but they were out of the watermelon BBQ sauce I love and the wings were not crispy tonight.  I am not a fan of chewy skin on my wings, so I took a pass on the rest after one bite.\n\nAfter coming for dinner multiple times and take out (pizza) a couple times, I would definitely recommend it to others and will be back.",318,3

"Pour diner (for dinner):\n\nI dunno, the wait wasn't long and the food was abundant and mostly good.\nThe French onion soup was my biggest disappointment. Luke warm, underseasoned, and no juicy croutons or bubbling cheese.\nBread was of negligible quality too. Surprisingly.\nPork chops with the rhubarb chutney were my favorite! So tender and savory sweet. The proteins here are generally pretty decent.\nGlass of $9 red added a nice punch. Especially with the olives and cheeses they had.\n\nI was examining the crab legs when a guy nearby started asking the lady behind the counter about the availability of clams. He had a French accent. A lady joined him at his side and partook in the conversation about the clams (\""klehms\"").\n\nSo, apparently French fellows eat here. There is surely no higher seal of approval (??). Mixed feelings.\n\nThe buffet interior/\""architecture\"" is absolutely adorable.",205,2
I'll chime in to support most of what has already been mentioned - the place aesthetically isn't that great but they do have awesome wings.  I get the garic parmesan wings every time.  MMM MMM MMM Good!,48,4
"Because it was an expensive meal, our group of 6 expected a finer dining experience.  The osso buco was very good.  The shrimp scampi with pasta lacked flavor.

"We had some time (40 minutes) before our movie started so we thought it would be a good spot to grab some food, and it was not busy at all on a friday night so we thought that would help with time too. We go in and even though the place is empty we are sat in a tiny dark corner and left to look at our menus. We sat for about 10 minutes and then we had to get up and go over to the several girls standing at the hostess stand and asked where our server was, after another 3 minutes or so he finally showed up and took our drink and food orders, the food took some time but did show up. It was good and I liked the brick oven taste it had but then they messed up on (and again took forever) to get our dessert order. We only saw our server once, no refills offered on our drinks and it was all together a horrible experience, and late 10 min to our movie. Next time we will go over to toby keith's place a short walk up instead!",220,1

"I've never had a meal experience like what I had at Delmonico's. Me and a buddy were in Vegas for the first time and decided we wanted to go out for a good steak dinner. I asked for recommendations from people and settled on Delmonico's. I made reservations the Monday before the Thursday we went to dinner. I checked out the menu ahead of time and was not surprised to see the pretty high prices., I was confident though that we were gonna get what we paid for. \nWe arrived about 45 minutes before the reservation time and had a couple beers in the lounge. $6 for a Bud Light was pretty reasonable for this atmosphere. We were seated promptly at 7 and that's where things got impressive. The dining area is secluded, you have no idea you are in a casino, which is great. We were greeted by one of our 3 waiters and offered the wine menu. Neither of us drink wine, but I could tell the selection was awesome. \nWe ordered the truffle and Parmesan potato chips and bowls of the gumbo. Both were excellent, Emeril knows gumbo. I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my buddy got the filet. We also got the potato gratin and a twice baked potato. The sides are ala carte and family style. They were some of the best potatoes we had ever had. As for the steaks, they were both the greatest steaks we had ever had! No sauce is necessary for these babies. After dinner I had the banana cream pie, which was exceptional. My buddy had the cheesecake and said it was awesome. \nOverall I can not speak highly enough of the dining experie nce at Delmonico's. The professional staff, excellent atmosphere, and amazing food make Delmonico's a place I will go to again.",378,4
"Given the crowd at the door, It only took us 15-20 minutes to be seated thanks to the quick turnover and speedy service. Although one of my hosts recommended the thin crepe like pancakes that Pamela's is known for, I opted for a more protein based breakfast as I had been making pancakes earlier that week. I ordered the eggs and chorio which was spicy and juicy. The star of my dish had to be the breakfast potatoes with chopped onions. I could eat that with some over easy eggs and oozing yolk all day every day as long as my body could accept it.  I had a bite of the pancakes and was definitely a fan with the thin crispiness and sweet strawberry topping.\n\nDefinitely a place to stop by in Pittsburgh on a weekend morning followed by a stroll or grocery trip on the Strip on a carefree weekend morning.",176,3
"I always get a kick out of this place because you can put your drink on the ice covered bar and it still stays cold.  The smallest things keep me entertained!!  But I do love this bar.  Their vodka is top notch and they have some of the most knowledgeable and friendliest bartenders ever.  The atmosphere is chill and classy at the same time.  I love the decor, it's almost like you are back in Russia.  I would spend way too much time in here if I lived in Vegas!",109,3
"Lux serves great coffee. The staff is a little iffy - sometimes tending to be impersonal or even rude. But I have also had some great staff experiences there.\n\nUsually Lux is busy, so good luck finding a seat. The atmosphere inside is great. Local art on their walls is constantly rotating. There are tons of electrical outlets which encourages using their free wifi!\n\nIf you go during lunch time do not miss out on stopping next door at Pane Bianco for some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.\n\nLux's pastries are good and they offer a verity of specialty bottled drinks. If you're a fan of iced tea try it with mango syrup - it's wonderful and not very many coffee shops I've been to have the mango syrup. It is my personal favorite. Also I love their soy velvet (a soy white mocha). Their smallest size is much smaller than average coffee shops - probably 8 ozs. But it's great if that's what you're looking for. All their lattes come with two shots of espresso, so you're only paying for more milk and syrup when you upsize, so buy according to how much you enjoy the flavor of espresso. \n\nTheir drink prices may seem a little high, but they're worth it. Plus their menu is elegantly designed. Tax is included on the prices listed, which features price points either on the dollar or fifty cent. Purely simple!",303,2
"I'm from Pittsburgh, therefore Primanti's holds a special place in my heart. It may not be the best sandwich in the world, but it's definitely high up there with the best. \n\nHowever, I don't really want to focus too much on the food aspect in this review - service is the main point. \n\nWe visited on a Friday night around 10:30 and the place had a decent crowd and looked to only have one server. She came to our table and didn't even bother to say \""hi\"" - just a \""What do you guys want.\"" Thankfully I was a little tipsy from the Pirate game and sort of ignored her lack of customer service. When our food came she was still very rushed and didn't say anything to us. My boyfriend finally had to pin her down after waiting for our check for nearly 15 minutes to pay. She was extremely rude and asked him where the bill was. When he told her we didn't have it yet she said responded by pretty much saying she's not a mind reader and she had no clue what we had. Rude! What the heck is wrong with you? I worked in a restaurant before and have had a full dining room to myself- I know how stressful it can be, however it is never okay to be so blatantly rude to customers. \n\nI'm giving this location three stars solely on food. My chicken sandwich was great and a great value for how big the sandwich was. I wasn't prepared by how spicy the chicken was going to be, but I was totally cool with it! Me love spicy foods! \n\nSoooo bottom line, this place was only bearable because I was drunk and hungry. If I was ever craving a Primanti's while sober in the area, I'll get it go to.",393,2
"Blessing and a curse that while everything else is bustling on mill at 1AM, Bison Witches is slow and quiet. When I needed a break from loud music, this was a welcome reprieve. The beer selection is small, but eclectic. I don't see Big Sky Moose Drool in just any bar, ya know. Good to see they've got appreciation for all the Rocky Mountain Brews. \n\n$5 jager bombs, and they were actual bombs where you drop a shot glass into a cup. So thrilled to see it done right! Perfect margaritas weren't so perfect, but they were pretty big so I'll let it slide.\n\nThis is a chill bar that I recommend using to regroup during your late-night Tempe benders. \n\nWhat's that...it's a restaurant too? Maybe I'll get around to trying the sandwiches!",190,2
"Let's get to the point: if you stick to the specials, you can overlook the mediocrity because it's hella cheap. At $2, I don't expect a good margarita, and the $2 tacos are Taco Bell quality. But it's a cheap place to eat and drink in a part of the strip where cheap eats and drinks are becoming hard to find. So load up on $2 Modelos and cheap tacos here before you move on to another place on the strip.",102,2
"I had very high expectations for an authentic and original concept to come to Charlotte and shake up the food scene in the South Park area. My expectation's were met with much disappointment. While everything was not terribly horrible, the restaurant was an oddity, the atmosphere felt confused and awkward, and the service was-HORRIBLE.\n\nWe were greeted by the general manager opening the door, which was nice, but the hostess sat us at a horrible table, when there was literally no one else in the restaurant. With multiple seating options it felt a little ridiculous to be sitting at the first tiny two top against a wall-which just felt unwelcoming. With booths available you think you would want to make your guests comfortable. \n\nThe server was the master of up-selling, he brought us out a $6 bottle of Fiji water-and without even presenting it he opened it up and proceeded to poor. Where is the tap water, the other tables had it? He asked if we wanted sparkling water or still water-thought this was synonymous with tap water??He also insisted on \""guiding\"" us through the \""dinner experience\""-like I cant order and read for myself. After an odd monologue about Baku-he moved us across the dining room so we would be more \""comfortable.\"" That was kind of awkward but I was glad to have a better table. \n\nFood-\nThe calamari was amazing. The calamari was tender, served hot and fresh, with the perfect amount of seasoning, it came with sliced green chillis that added a nice kick of flavor. A little oily but this didn't distract me from enjoying it. 10/10\n\nIt went downhill from there-\n\nScallops with foi gras- Ok, they were amazing as well, but we waited 15 minutes between finishing the calamari and receiving the scallop. I say scallop because it was one scallop cut in half- you think you'd receive more for 19 dollars? It had a nice flavor but the foi gras was not substantial and by the time it got to the table it had melted away, also hard to cut with chopsticks. 6/10\n\nChicken Skewers with leeks- Ok- came out hot, had a nice smoky flavor from the grill-right amount of sauce, but where were the leeks? It looked like green scallions were substituted for leeks, and this didn't lend the same amount of  appeal and flavor you would experience with actual leeks. 4/10\n\nDuck breast Entree- Nicely rendered piece of duck, cooked properly, it had a smoky flavor and it was nicely done. It lacked seasoning and a sauce. It came with a small dish of chopped plum chunks-which added a nice sweetness but lacked the body of a sauce and didn't adhere to the duck because it was hard and awkward to eat with chopsticks.. This could have been an amazing dish if it had been served with a sauce and hadn't been so difficult to eat. 7/10\n\n-May I mention that our server suggested we order a vegetable to \""cleanse our palet.\""  So I assume this means before the meat course/main entree? We literally waited for 20 minutes after we finished the duck entree for corn on the cob. By this point the meal had ended- and waiting 20 minutes for corn felt silly. Also no one came by our table to ask if we were ok- the server literally disappeared  When he brought it out he had the audacity to say it eats like desert- by that point we just wanted a check and a box for the corn. \n\nOverall-Weird experience. The music was horrible as well-felt like I was at a graduation party. The ambiance felt confused and unestablished.Food was good, but the courses were improperly timed, dishes could have used a little bit of seasoning or at least the server should offer salt and pepper. Service was non-exsistant for most of the experience, the server was nice and \""attentive\"" at first but after he took our orders he spent most of his time doing side work making us feel abandoned and awkward- the restaurant was pretty much empty- you think you'd be a little more attentive. The service and experience could have been better-especially since the South Park area has a decent amount of competition for a new restaurant. They need to step it up if they want to survive. \n\n\nWouldnt go back. Overall- 5-10 \nNot worth the price :(",958,1
"Nothin to write home about.  \n\nHad the frozen hot chocolate.  They definitely use a higher quality hot chocolate (syrup, not powder based from what I can tell although they sold pouches of the mix).  \n\nI also like their parlor theme.  Cute place to hang out.",67,2
"I was really craving some good pho on saturday and so my friend and I decided to try a place we'd never been before. We came here and while service and staff were great, the food was... lacking.\n\nI am a huge pho fan, and was really surprised to see black pepper sprinkled on top of my food when I arrived. Then I tried the broth, it was like no pho broth I'd ever tasted before: it was bland and made me go \""what?\"" With every bite I took, I kept hoping it would taste better, but alas, it was just as disappointing every time.\n\nThe reason for the lonely little star though? I love tripe in my pho. Love, love, love it. There was only a single piece, and it wasn't cleaned very well at all. I took a bite and immediately tasted everything you should not be tasting when eating tripe and thought I would vomit right there at the table.\n\nI will definitely not be going back here. There is another pho place in the plaza which is a million times better, go there instead.",232,0
"So I've been here twice within 3 days and not because I wanted to.  I'm not a fan of buffets for my lack of self control.  LOL  Monday I brought my daughter and her friend for lunch.  Immediately you are greeted by all the employees \""Welcome to Cici's!\"".  Pretty nice little greeting I must say. The girl at the cashier asked \""how many\"" and I said 3.  As I started to ask about the child rate she handed me a receipt that said 3 adults.  I simply asked her what was the age for the child rate.  She in turn asked me how old the girls were.  I replied that both of them are 11 and in passing asked \""oh is the age 10 and under\"" and she replied back \""no its 11 and under\"".  She proceeded to look past me to help the next customer and I shook my head and decided to just dismiss that whole convo.  Challenging stupidity doesn't make for a good lunch with my girls.\n\nWe quickly found our seats and the girls were up and at em.  We each grabbed a tray.  A couple of the dishes I picked up were dirty so I just set them to the side. The pasta is one of my favorite simple things however when I got up there the pasta needed refilled.  I asked the girl behind the counter if they knew their pasta needed refilled.  She replied \""yes\"" and continued with her pizzas not even headed to the pasta to see what I was referring to.  Instead she addressed some \""regular\"" customers behind me-hence the immediate dismissal of the question.  Kinda awkward to say the least. Finally 10 minutes later it was refilled. Sigh.\n\nThey serve pasta salad, salad, soup, corkscrew pasta with red and white sauce, breadsticks & garlic knots, a plethora of pizza and a few dessert options.  Their  food is what it is....a really cheap family buffet.  With that said the pizzas leave a lot to be desired, don't have much cheese or meat, have a lot of dough but is all good for the carb-evore in you!  This place really should be named CiCi's CARB Buffet! Its a bread lovers dream! You seriously need to put in some cardio time after eating here.\n\nThe place is pretty beat up.  The walls, floors and tables are scuffed up and chipped.  Its definitely a place to bring all the children and your neighbors children.  You can tell they all have been here! LOL  There are TVs mounted up high that had children shows on them.  You cant hear the sound so I'm always not sure why restaurants even bother.  There is a small arcade in the back that the kids love.  There's a community board that has a few things posted but looks all greasy from little hands touching it.  Another dirty detail.\n\nNow while the girls were spending their couple dollars on the arcade I was checking in on my handy dandy YELP app on my phone.  While I sit there and observe the chaos around me, my eyes found there way up the wall in slow motion....  Eeek! The Health Department grade!  Like an elephant in the room-how did I miss it when it was right in front of me the whole time I was eating!  I can say I'm not surprised however at the same time I'm not even sure if I had ever seen a C Grade in person.  Hm. That's right Graded a C!  Thank goodness it was after we ate because that is a sure turn off to me regardless of the details.  I do watch Restaurant Impossible! LOL\n\nOn a side note, at the end of our meal the manager came over to ask if everything was to our satisfaction.  I decided not to bother to inform him of the awkward and lazy service from his employees.  I think the place is run with super young people with lack of guidance possibly.  He was just a baby himself-or I'm just old.  I beg to differ.  LOL  \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be back anytime soon.  This is only a \""when I have to\"" place to eat - category of Chuck E Cheese. LOL.  I will for sure be checking the grade next time though with curiosity of an upgrade! ;)",931,1
"Such a disappointment! I ordered my Fav-a carne asada burrito w/ cheese, sour cream & bacon. I know crazy!! I paid $9 for a burrito! Usually it's not that much at the other locations. So when I opened the bag of disappointment & saw the smallest burrito ever, well that left me sad. But the party just began cuz the taste of the ingredients topped off the dismal feeling put forth by this location makes me sad to say this location blows",98,1
"Not consistent, left me ill \n\nFor what it's worth I have enjoyed the food I've gotten at Burger Rush. I've been there three times but I won't be returning. The third visit left me with a stomach ache that kept me on the couch or in bed for half the day. This is corroborated by my friend whom I dined with and experienced the same symptoms the next day. (We don't live with one another and that was the only occasion that week when we were together, or ate together) Each visit it seemed as though the food was different, the burgers and the fries, but specifically the fries. (Ranging from soggy, to too much batter, not enough) These three visits to Burger Rush were within the first two months they were open, so I can excuse the inconsistency, but there is no excuse for poor quality food or poorly cooked food that leaves their customers with stomach pains. In addition, I was very disappointed that they didn't have sweet potato tots, which are on the menu but apparently they don't carry them (I've unsuccessfully ordered them three times ha). Service was mediocre, and often took a while to receive your food, specifically for a burger joint with a drive thru. I've waited 20 minutes for two burgers in their drive thru. Overall really disappointed, I live in the neighborhood and have a demand for a burger joint that's open past last call.  On the plus side, after a peek at the other reviews, it doesn't seem as though anyone else has gotten ill from eating at Burger Rush. Could have been isolated, but once is one too many, not taking my chances.",348,0

"I have visited this location about a dozen times now since they opened. Their sandwiches are good. I especially love their freshly-baked bread. Always plenty of staff behind the counter so service is super fast, a feature that keeps me coming back over Subway or other shops. There are times they are nearly done making my sandwich by the time I'm done paying for it. Service is usually friendly. Location is weird and slightly inconvenient to find.",90,3
"Let me break down the Clubhouse really simple for you.\n\nParking is a bitch, there is a huge office parking lot to the west (across the street) that I've never had a problem parking in.\n\nThe staff is all business, don't bring some shady looking ID (vertical AZ ID, cracked, peeling, etc) and expect to get your wristband.\n\nIf you need to use the bathroom and can get next door to The Horse and The Hound, do it. Their bathrooms are approximately 350% cleaner than The Clubhouse's.\n\nThe A/C isn't the best, so if you go to a show in the summer expect to sweat your respective nether regions off. Be ready to put your hair up, leave your pants (wear shorts) at home and hoodies in the car.\n\nThat being said, they have great bands come through. The bar is pretty decent and keeping the above caveats in mind will net you a solid experience.",211,3
"Stopped by for lunch a few weeks ago. The location is notorious for the changing restaurants, so I hope this one has better luck than the previous establishments. My mother and I ordered some ribs and a salad! The salad was okay, nothing to great, but the ribs were tasty. They had a certain kick to them! They were a little bit pricey, but their a hometown/small business so I don't mind paying the little extra.",91,2
"I wouldn't be so harsh on my review if this place wasn't a four star restaurant with a famous award winning chef. I expected a lot and was shocked at what was lacking.  First, the restaurant had no daily specials.  How does a restaurant of this caliber not have daily special entrees?? No fresh ingredients that was flown in for that week? No special entree that the Chef has created just for that day? Not a single special?? \n\nSecond, my friend had a steak and it was tough as hell.  TOUGH.  My jaw hurt eating it.  It wasn't overcooked, it was literally the quality of the meat, or perhaps they didn't know to rest the meat afterwards. Whatever it was, the steak was horrible and a fifty dollar steak should never be like that. What a disappointment.\n\nThird, my mussels were not fresh.  Unacceptable.  \n\nIt wasn't all bad, the duck pate and the braised ribs got rave reviews, but other than that and the service, the food itself was disappointing. I refuse to believe that the chef has been anywhere near the restaurant in recent months. If he was, someone of his background would never serve meat of that quality.",262,1
"I just attended a wedding here in early June. DO NOT BOOK it in the heat of the summer! Even though the fountains' ambiance gave it that babbling brook sound, it did nothing to offset the heat. I was amazed no one passed out! They tried fans on the sides but they blew so hard, no one could sit near them or hear anything.And even though we were moved into the reception area after 1/1/2 hours of pictures, the room never cooled off enough with the amount of attendees..To make matters worse, after the cake was cut, we were asked to relocate back outside for dancing so the staff could clean up. It was still over 100 degrees out there at 9 p.m.! If you are going to spend that  kind of money in the summer months in Phoenix, go with an all air conditioned venue for the guests to enjoy.And there were only two  female bathrooms available for guests to use, so there were lines often.\nNow on the positive,the garden was very nice although the roof of the reception area was dirty and made it appear dark.I will rate the food as o.k.because they ran out of lamb kabobs,one of the three meats offered along with chicken kabobs and roast beef , the salad was a bit wilted, most likely due to the heat ,and some of the other dishes were dry. and finally, the mashed potatoes they served were instant.I did not dare try the sushi table in that heat.The staff was excellent, very attentive,polite and pleasant. They were working very hard the entire time.",331,2

"Yes, they have a lot of beers on tap and that's why I gave it 2 stars. Otherwise, food was not good and the service was awful. Unless your going for the draft beer I would skip yard house. There are tons of restaurants in the area with better food, better service and beer on tap.",67,1
"The Tron is a Scream pub, which are magnets for students. This is probably to do with their winning formula of cheap pints, fully stocked bar, 2 for 1 meal deals and quiz nights. All Scream bars thus attract a throng of people after a gruelling day of studying is over, or even when a hard day of studying seems too much like hard work.\n\nI always enjoy my time in The Tron. The bar staff are friendly, there's usually a good atmosphere and, like most, I am attracted by their cheap booze deals. The food is decent pub fayre and the service is good, leaving no cause for complaints.\n\nIt can get mobbed at the weekends and it's not the kind of place that's full of Stiletto's with a backlit bar.

"As of today, this is still the best Greek / Mediterranean food I have tasted in Clark County, although I admit I haven't been to too many such establishments. It's a tiny, quaint little place with some fitting ethnic decorations on the walls and Greek colors over the tables.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about this joint is that it is very much a mom and pop establishment. The food is VERY home cooked and you'll taste it right away. The owner is a Greek lady who is generally a very nice host--but she may fuss a bit over Groupons-- just a warning. You'll also be pleased to find that the servings are quite generous. The wraps are all very filling and come with a heap of delicious seasoned fries. I barely finished the platter when I ordered it for dinner recently. \nThe greek salad is mouthwateringly delicious and she sure doesn't skimp on it. \n\nAs for the gyros, arguably the staple of any place with \""Greek\"" in the title, they are the best I have ever tasted. Seriously. You'll immediately notice a difference in the meat that she uses, as well as the authentic Tzatziki sauce that she puts in them. If you order gyros around town at casual fast food places, you'll very easily notice the superior quality of this one. I've also had the Kefka (kabob) and the chicken wraps which were both quite pleasing. \n\nYou usually spend about 12-14 dollars per person here, and I hope that doesn't discourage some of you cheaper yelpers out there. Sure, you could probably go get another gyro for half the price within a few miles but the extra few dollars are well worth it for by the superior quality of the food. There is a little bit of a wait, but take satisfaction knowing that it's time spent cooking and preparing your meal freshly.",401,3

"The Hanging Bat has barely opened & as my visit was over a week a go some of the things I'm dubious about with it may have been tinkered with in that time as I'm sure there's a learning curve being followed.\nThey certainly can't be faulted for going down the microbrewery route or introducing a further option for lovers of things non-Tennent's, especially in the location they've chosen.\nWhat they could do with though is having their pumps clearly labeled & not requiring punters to rely on the blackboard affixed rather closer to the ceiling than the floor. Their range of bottled beers is undeniably impressive but I'd be interested to see how many of the \u00a328 one they sell over the next twelve months. I'm also not totally sold on there not being any actual pints available  the most you can hope for is two thirds of one. Is this likely to fool people into thinking they're getting a bargain (you're not  prices work out at the upper end of the Edinburgh range) or have them unconciously drink more, faster? I don't for a minute actually think either of those things has been deliberately sought but they are possible consequences of the policy.\nA work in progress then that shows promise & somewhere I'm sure I'll be back in when a civilised drink's the order of the day.",292,2
"I was just thinking something about this mall and I just had to post this: I am generally not a fan of malls. I hate crowds anywhere so that probably taints my opinion of a lot of places.  My wife and I went yesterday. For a mall I guess it's pretty good.\n\nI've been coming to the Metro Mall ever since I moved here years ago. It was my favorite. I guess in some odd way I can't really explain it still is my favorite. Maybe it's nostalgia I don't know. that being said this mall has really gone downhill in the last couple years. Ok maybe longer. Much longer.... I know compared to other malls around the valley this is not much of a the happening mall  anymore. Like I said for some reason I still have a fondness for it.\n\nEven though this mall has declined in the number of stores that are open in it over the years there still are some decent ones left. Like Macy's, Sears, radio Shack, Spencer's, etc. ....\n\nMetro Mall is very clean, and brightly lite. There is plenty of parking, extra security roaming the parking lots during the holidays. I do wish they had better restaurants in the mall but with their decline over the years many of the better places closed up shop. However there are plenty of wonderful restaurants to meets every desired appetite and taste around the Mall (Metro Parkway).\n\nDuring the holiday's it's amazing how beautiful they got this mall to look  and how  busy it can get. Go there during the week (even during the holidays) and there's no crowds. Amazing!\n\n******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.

Our service was pretty good but a little slow and the she forgot several items.

"Little fashion boutiques are hidden treasures. If you're looking for something that's stylish and that's not entirely mainstream (many of the fashions *everyone* would find at the mall), Identity is worth checking out if you're looking for a unique pair of jewelry or different styles of fashion. It is a small boutique indeed, but even the smallest of boutiques definitely have some very unique styles that everyone isn't wearing.\n\nI can agree with the first reviewer that the prices are a little over the top. When I went in, there was a buy one get one free for jewelry, so that was worth it, but otherwise many of the clothes were at least over $30. Don't get me wrong, you *are* paying for the quality of fabrics used and the fashion itself (most garments are made from very fine and delicate fabrics), but at the same time... I feel as if I can find the same style in a Buffalo Exchange for half the price.\n\nIdentity has everything from jewelry, purses, blazers, heels, hair accessories, and more. If you're looking to splurge on a cute outfit that speaks your style, Identity should be on your list to check out.",252,2

"Ah yes, Thee Pitts Again. Its been a year since I have visited this place after seeing it on Triple D. I am always down for trying a new place and a new BBQ place? Shoot I am so there. Well lets just say that I was not overly impressed and Triple D let me down again. \n\nThe place was packed when we went but we didn't have to wait long for a seat. Service was really good and the young man that was waiting on us was on top of things but when it came down to the food, it was just ok. (At least the main course anyway) We ordered the onions rings as an appetizer and they were actually very good. The cornbread with the honey butter was pretty tasty as well. Now for our main course, we ordered the combo platter to share which had the chicken, pork ribs, beef ribs, brisket, pork shoulder and ham. I just remember the chicken which I think was pulled was dry, the ham being very salty, and the the ribs were fatty. :( bummer, but the sauce and the sweet potato were good. \n\nMaybe it was just an off night, who knows, but I haven't been back since to give it another try. I really wanted to like this place especially after seeing it on Triple D and seeing all the awards he had won. There are other BBQ places in the area but unfortunately Thee Pitts Again is not one I would personally recommend.",299,1
I love this place. We have stayed here several times.. It big quite and has everything that you need. Also like the fact that you don't have to go through a Busy casino to get to your beautiful room and the view is amazing.. I just Love it.. I got to say. for some reason the bathtub is always broken.:( But I could deal with just the shower tho.. LOL,82,3
"Elizabeth Square = FAIL.  We recently just moved out- thank God.  It was one of the worst apartment experiences ever.  The most recent issue that we had with Elizabeth Square is that they charged us $280 to replace the carpet.  When we called about this- they said that due to stains (which were already there when we moved in) we are charged with replacing the carpet.  Crazy how we would get charged for replacing carpet when we were probably the 5th tenant that lived on those gross carpets.  They just decided that we were the lucky ones that would pay for someone else to have new carpets.  I could go on and on about how terrible this place is.  If you are a college student then this is the right place for you- if you can afford it.  The fire alarm goes off in the middle of the night just about every month- no matter what day it is...I am assuming someone wanted to pull a prank and watch everyone else stumble out of their apartment at 2:00 in the morning and sit for an hour until the fire department comes and checks everything out.  You have to watch were you walk in all the hallways and stairways because you just might stumble on dog poop, throw up, left over pizza, and food.  Beware where you park because you just might get your car hit by some crazy drunk person that lives at Elizabeth Square.  This one was a doozie- 4 cars were nailed literally...like pieces of their cars going up the parking garage- causing tons of damage because someone was driving too fast through the parking garage.  You cannot even go to the pool because it is like a frat party, people are shot gunning cans of beer in the pool, booty humping, and people are there that do not even pay rent.  Security is consistently compromised because everyone leaves the outside doors open- so anyone off the street can walk into the apartment building.  Try to move in on a Saturday and everyone and their brother is also moving in...you can barely get into the parking garage.  It is a cluster mess.  The worst part about it is that it was so expensive to live there.  We paid over $1800 in rent for a 2 bedroom that was not functional at all.  The closet in the second bedroom was not accessible- because the door was in the way.  You had to shimmy yourself in between your clothes to close the door to get to your other hanging clothes.  The place is awful- whatever you do not live there.  Go next door to the Metro...Elizabeth Square is not worth it.",542,0
"Went here to get an inspection done since I had tires put on about a year and a half ago. I had to get my inspection done by a Goodyear or firestone so I decided firestone since I've been here before even though I don't ever trust this brand.\nI honestly think I was stupid and have never worked on a car before. First they failed my inspection for a headlight supposedly being out. (It was a fog light) not a headlight. Just trying to make an extra $30 I'm sure. On top of that they said I needed new drum and shoes on the back. \""They are shot\"" is what the front desk guy said. Said I had to replace them before they would pass inspection. This is where I think they think I was stupid. They offered me $50 off right then and there to do them, so I wouldn't ask any questions. I declined so I went by the auto parts store and got everything for $100 instead of the $400 minus $50 they wanted to do. I take all wheels off since I was going to rotate tires as well. I get the drums off the back and and compare the drum and shoes to the new ones. Almost no difference. They needed to be cleaned but that's it seriously. I have pictures if you think I'm lying. I hope the shop knows who is writing this and to make it clear I had a 2008 ford focus. Took it to my mechanic and passed with flying colors. What a joke firestone. Don't lie to your customer by putting on a piece of paper drum brakes very concerning. I WILL NEVER BE BACK :) instead try whiteys auto near old town. Honest people and competitive prices. Trust me they are worth it!",371,0
"Very awesome restaurant in all respects: good food, good service, good environment, etc. I had French just like three times before. Base on my limited experience, I always thought French comes with very small portion. I ordered the steak and my friend ordered seafood crepe and fish. They are all in huge portion, especially the steak! And they are delicious!!! The hand cut fries and French bread are great! \n\nIf it's not too cold, try to seat outside. It's really romantic and you get to see the strip. \n\nI would give it a 4.5 star.",128,3
"A group of us ate dinner at MOzen during CES week.  We changed our reservations 3x and they were very accommodating.  I must say, the experience wasn't what I hoped for. The Mandarin Oriental is such an elegant & high-end chain that I expected much more from their restaurant.  MOzen isn't fancy, which is totally fine, but their prices didn't justify the fare.  \n\nThe menu is all over the place.  Some would call it diverse but I call it awkward.  They have Sushi so there's your Japanese option, then Indian dishes for another Asian feature, then randomly you see a Caprese salad and Osso Bucco. Didn't know Italian food was somehow related to Asian fusion.  I had Osso Bucco at a fine establishment the previous night so I wasn't tempted to order it again but I found it interesting to see on the menu. \n\nStumped & dissatisfied w/their selections, my fianc\u00e9 & I decided to order sushi and small plates to share rather than an entree.\n\n--------------------------\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll = 3 stars\n* average spicy tuna roll. Menu states that it's blended with spicy chili aioli but I couldn't taste it.\n\nTempura Shrimp Roll = 3.5 stars\n* surprisingly better than I expected. It was crunchy but not overdone w/batter.\n\n72 Hour Kobe Short Rib = 2.5 stars\n* loved the edamame puree but the short rib was way too fatty. I know fat gives it flavor but I don't want 50% fat on such a small serving of short rib.\n\nCalamari = 3.5 stars\n* served with 2 dipping sauces - marinara and saffron-dijon aioli. Better than average but nothing to rave about.  Could've used some seasoning.\n\nBlackened Albacore Tuna Tataki = 4.5 stars\n* my favorite selection in the entire evening.  Fresh & flavorful Albacore Tuna and nice presentation. Sauces complimented the tuna well.\n\nLychee Smash = 3 stars\n* delicious mojito-style cocktail but it didn't really do it for me.  I think it was $19 and for that price, I expected some kick.\n\nLychee Martini = 3 stars\n* for my 2nd drink I decided not to refill the Lychee Smash and ordered a typical Lychee Martini.  It wasn't on the menu and our waiter said he'd have to check if they can make it. Really? Anyway, apparently they can make it but it was so frothy. Never had a frothy version of this martini before. It was ok and same price as the 1st drink. I should've just ordered wine.\n\n--------------------------\n\nOur bill came out to ~$550 for a group of 4.  This is a bit much for an unsatisfactory experience.\n\nDim lighting, amazing views of City Center, and culinary displays of food may be the only justification for their prices. In that regard, MOzen deserves 5 stars.  I read some good reviews on their breakfast so that may be the only time I dine here again.  Pass on dinner.  It's mediocre and overpriced.",726,2
The atmosphere was inviting and well done and the noise level as appropriate for conversation. The wine list was excellent but by the glass was a little short for prices. The food was cooked as ordered and portions generous. The Key Lime pie was made with real Key Limes and was best we've had in the valley. Will repeat although a little bit of a drive  for us.,78,3

"A friend of ours was getting married at the Hilton back in October of 2010. My husband and I decided to stay at the Hilton as well. I have a couple complaints, but my major one is the bed size request system. When I booked the room, I had reserved a king sized bed. When I drove in from Santa Barbara (probably got in at 11:30PM), I was told that I would be having a Queen. This confused me as I had reserved a King. According to the hotel, it;s on a first come, first serve basis. Basically, regardless if I made a reservation  yesterday or months in advance like I had, if other people check in before me, I could not get a King. Personally, I think this is a crap policy. IF you reserve a King, you should get a king. We were only staying for two nights, and they said I could move rooms, but not that night, I could for the next day. We weren't going to get adjusted, pack everything up the next day, move rooms, get adjusted again, and then leave so we just stayed in our room. They didn't offer to compensate or anything. They only offered the room switch after I keep complaining to the management. And I wasn't the only one with this issue. Another woman was complaining about the same thing when I was complaining at the front desk. \n\nMy only other qualm is that it seems like you have to walk VERY long distances to get anywhere, and the layout is confusing. \n\nBut the room was sort of nice.",336,1

"I loved this place when I lived here and I always make sure to stop by and bring some friends here when I visit. The sushi was the BEST I have ever had until recently when I brought my 2 friends here for a belated Birthday dinner.\nThe presentation was always something to look forward to but not anymore, the Chef just slapped it on some dishes with no flair or care, the sauces that I always brag about was missing or in a thicker consistency and the wonderful ponzu sauce was missing. It's been a wonderful 10 years but unfortunately I will no longer be coming here again or refer it to anyone else.",129,0

Just go ahead and write down where you are when you stop your car... Not only is there a deck under the mall, there are multiple decks around the mall...

Mmmm... Haagen-Dazs... Is it bad that the first thing I think of is the ice cream?  I mean, if I'm walking around, I'm burning calories, right?  I also love the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory... The caramel apples really do perk me up... They also have quite a few restaurant options inside the mall: Cheesecake Factory, City Tavern, California Pizza Kitchen and Maggiano's to name a few... \n\nShopping?  Guess, Bebe, BCBG Max Azaria, Banana Republic, Aldo, Aldo Accessories, Sephora, Francesca's Collections, Nine West, Victoria's Secret and Express... All fabulous stock with nice staff...

"Located inside Aria.\n\nService:  3 stars\nCleanliness:  5 stars\nFood:  2 stars\n\nI love Thai food so after looking at the menu I didn't hesitate to ask to be seated.\n\nThe ingredients they use are fresh, but unless I came on an off-day everything is WAY TOO SALTY.\n\nI ordered the Tom Yum soup with Tiger Prawns and Basil Pork over steamed rice.  I couldn't believe how salty everything was, it completely overpowered any other flavors (e.g. lemongrass, basil, etc).  I wanted to wash down everything with water, but the waiter only came back once to check on me.\n\nGiven the number of choices you have in Las Vegas, I would avoid this place.",171,1

One standout for me was the sliders they have available! The Calamari is something you can pass on, but everything else is up to par with the taste and pricing of a place like this. \n\n4*'s for the drinks and vibe, not quite 5, because the food is ok, no WOW factor!

"Francais plus bas\nWe had a little get together with friend at work and order large plates of Sushi of all kind from Ichi Sushi. At the beggining I was quite worried. The last time my employer had bought some, it felt like eating a sushi with overcooked rice, no seasoning, bad product. Enough to make you stop eating sushi for 1 month. However this place is definetily ok. Good bargain and great variety too. It is Sushi on the Cheap side of sushi so you can't expect nothing more than average\n\n\nOn a command\u00e9 un plateau de sushi au boulot pour c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 puis je ne mentirais pas que j'avais tr\u00e8s peur d'avoir les m\u00eames sushis que la derni\u00e8re fois il nous avait apport\u00e9.

"Blech. I had a coupon in the mail for a free pizza rustico, so my husband and I tried this place one night. I ended up getting one of the thin crust pizzas, and it was awful. My husband got the baked ziti, and there was virtually no sauce on it, so it was very dry and bland. The service was also pretty poor. We did get the pizza rustico to go, however, and when I heated it up later was pretty pleased with it. But I think that might be the only good thing on the menu.",116,1
"Horrible service. Horrible food. Meals were delivered to the table at separate times not all at once. They forgot a dinner. A party of 4, each eating diner alone.

"This remains the only authentic Japanese sushi restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. It has been here since 1982, and the chef is 40-year certified preparer - the real deal. I spend a good deal of time in larger cities - like NYC, where you can find good sushi on every other corner and I can say - as an advanced sushi connoisseur (I've been eating raw fish since I was 2) this place is the right place for the advanced palette. There will be things in the back that are not present on the menu so as not to scare away the average customer - but they will have everything that they can obtain safely - simply ask. \n\nSure, it's going to be expensive. You have to pay much more for quality in a land-locked city, and Pittsburgh, though what I like to call \""cutely diverse\"" does not have the array of resources for quality sushi without a price. Ask the chef here and he will tell you that most of the seafood he has comes in from a very reputable atlantic source - think New York.\n\nI would recommend any handroll, and the specialty roll. Order Amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) when in season and you will be a happy camper. The oshitoshi is well seasoned with salmon skin and a delicious soy mixture - not too salty. And the green tea ice cream goes well with a spoonful of red beans.\n\nENJOY!",301,4
"We've been trying to use our Living Social deal to this place for a couple months now... we finally had the chance on Saturday night.  My take on Melting Pot has always been that the cheese and the dessert are awesome - but that I could pretty much do without the meat course in the middle.\n\nSo we started with the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, which was really really good.  The wedge salad with bacon and peppercorn ranch, also good.  Then we got to the meat course.  Without turning this into a novel, we discovered that one of the shrimp that had been cooking in our broth fhad not been de-turded.  That's right, it had been cooking with the rest of our meat, in poo-broth.  \n\nSo, there goes the appetite, and after bringing it up to the waiter - and his discussing it with the manager - they were \""gracious\"" enough to take a $5 beer off our tab.\n\nI'm sorry, but serving poop to customers, should pretty much be a no-no.  Especially at those prices.  I kept thinking of the line from one of my favorite movies, The Jerk, \""You would think, at these prices, you could keep the POOP off the food!\"".\n\nI digress... suffice it to say, we won't be going back to The Melting Pot.",297,0

It honestly is not what it tries to portray itself to be. Sure, it's lovely but that's probably it. Small and overcrowded dance floors are definitely a no go for a good time.

It's like it's partner, LAVO, it really is not one of the greatest spots in Vegas to go out dancing. \n\nThe good thing, for ladies, is that there is an open bar up until 10:30 pm!

"The wife and I really love this place. We were both very happy when Whole Foods finally opened and have been going there regularly ever since. We both find that they have distinct products that cannot be found at any other store in Charlotte. They also play up the organic products a lot, if that's important to you. They have a great selection of fruits and vegetables, as well as seafood and meats.\n\nI think that my favorite area is the cheese section due to the overall selection and the fact that they offer samples of pretty much anything for you to try before buying. Oh and they serve beer and wine right next to the cheese counter that they also allow you to walk around with and shop while you imbibe. They also have an in house cafeteria area for a variety of ready to eat meals to go. The staff is always energetic and upbeat. The one knock is the parking lot which can be a nightmare at peak hours, especially with all the people who have trouble parking their big SUVs. Even with the parking situation, it won't be keeping us away.",219,4

Honestly.. It's a one stop shop!  I needed shoes and found not one pair but two pairs; one of which were on clearance!!

I was able to sign up for their membership (which is totally free for entertainers FYI) and I was able to get an additional discount!!

"I love the golden nugget. It's a great place to stay and have fun. I'm giving the place 3 stars because of there sportsbook. I have been here for the last 3 days and have placed bets over $11,000 and only once have they offered me a free drink coupon. The people in there who work behind the counter are not friendly and act like your bothering them when you want to place a bet. The tickets I've come back with that are winners they act like they don't want to pay me. Like I'm taking their money? What's up with that? It's sad that I now had to go and sit inside the casino hosts office that is located inside the Keno area and complain. I talked to the manager of the sports book who's name is tony and he said he was surprised as to my complaint. But I informed him I was denied to place a $3600 wager on baseball by the black girl at the counter so I said ok and walked across to Binions horseshoe and placed my bet there.

"Great food for the price. Have been twice now both at lunch time. One during the week and then again during the weekend. Very busy both times. During the week, the service is great, fast and friendly. The food was cooked to perfection. Went on a Sunday, and although the food was just as good, the service was a bit slower. However, the food was just as good. \n1st visit - Had the grilled fajitas. Homemade and very good. Comes with beans and rice. The rice was fluffy and didn't taste like Phoenix water.....which most Mexican restaurants serve. The beans tasted as if they were made just minutes prior to serving. All you can eat chips and salsa made the whole experience worth it.\n2nd visit - Had the grilled chicken salad burrito. Extremely fresh and so very yummy! It also came with beans and rice and both were cooked just as well as the 1st time. It did take forever to get our check and the to-go drink we ordered, but all in all it was worth it.\nWill go again.",223,3

I am a huge fan of Tryst and the service they provide there.  \n\nTryst had two problems:\n1.not enough bathrooms\n2.not enough stripper poles\n\nThey seriously solved the hell out of both of these problems!!!  Stripper poles disguised as very large chic light fixtures and more restroom stalls than Giant's Stadium.  The whole club is so stunning, no doubt it will be the number 1 spot in vegas.",108,4
"Great place.\nGreat deal. \nA friend and I were able to stay here for a week (Mon-Sat) for $400- total! \nYes..thats it...$400-!\nOf course we decided to go right after labor day and everything died down and all the bratty screaming crying kids were back in school.\nThat said..the place was still fairly crowded.\nThey have 2 pools......well 1 pool and 1 lazy river.  I didn't get to check out the river but the pool is a nice size! I was able to get 1 day of sun (since it was raining most of the week).\nThey have a general store with clothes and drugs (aspirin etc.) and drinks and alcohol.\nNothing was really overpriced.\nEveryone was nice and accommodating.\nRight next door there is Tahiti Joe's (Restaurant/Bar) and a 24hr Dennys!\nCan't beat that.\nOur room was nice.  The bed had tons of pillows (which was great!).\nThe bed was nice and comfortable.  Plus since Tahiti Village is mostly a time-share place, there was a small kitchen w/ a sink and refrigerator.\nI would definitely stay here again..its right down the street from Mandalay Bay and the famous Las Vegas sign.",282,3
Awesome. Outstanding service. Quality sushi. I am coming back again and again.,17,4
Not good the dessert was really bad ! The food was ok nothing g memorable .. Only good thing about this place is customer service! Won't go again,32,1
My son loves this place but not me. My son is only 4 and I can't really sit down without some kid trying to take his coins. So as he gets older and able to hold his own ill be more comfortable with this place. But it's def inexpensive though so that's a good thing.,67,2
"L'Avenue is one of my favourite Montreal dining experiences. Judging from the line up I waited in, it's also a favourite of many others. They offer delicious food for every meal, including a coveted breakfast and delicious and creative lunch and dinner options. I was especially enamoured with their sesame and tofu salad. Unfortunately, the veggie burger was a bit mealy and bland. \n\nI would also imagine this is one of the cooler places to go in Montreal for food. Even their weird heavily curtained entrance seems to shun the outside world. The lighting and decor is awesome, especially in the bathroom. It basically feels like a red lit cage with various art on the walls and intense movies playing on a TV in the wall by the sink (Party Monster was playing while I used the facilities). On that note, if you take kids here, you may want to make sure they pee before arriving.",185,3
"Great food and great folks! \n\nWe really enjoyed ourselves at Weeziana gumbo and more.  My wife had the Shrimp Po-Boy that was overflowing with shrimp and sprinkled with their Weezisauce. The sauce is sorta like a removable but spicier and better. \n\nI had the fish basket (sole) with fries and Weeziana and a small seafood gumbo with shrimp crab and lobster. This was a good bowl of gumbo with a nice dark roux. \n\nIt was our first time their and everyone behind the counter treated us like family. (No, the good way) \n\nThe meal for both of us was just under $25. BONUS! \n\nThe only thing that they need is a bigger sign so you can find them. They are in a food court next to a car wash. \n\nI highly recommend this place.",192,4
"In a word: underwhelming. I'm saddened and frustrated, really. BLD is a cool place with a fantastic pedigree that I want so badly to like, but it just won't let me.\n\nToday's breakfast was my second visit. The first was for lunch shortly after opening. It was an unmitigated disaster. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at that time, but can't avoid Yelping at this point.\n\nHad the short ribs Benedict. Although the eggs were poached nearly perfectly, they were covered in a bland red wine Hollandaise that looked like melted Silly Putty and lacked the citrusy brightness that a good Holalndaise should have. The short ribs were pot-roasty, rather than the velvety melt-in-your mouth delight that you'd expect. Overall, the dish was under-seasoned and wan, but you couldn't complain that the short ribs were too rich.\n\nThe side of potatoes and onions was good with the exception of the fact that the onions were inconsistently cooked; some were crunchy while others were soft and beginning to brown. I'd prefer better browning and a nice crust, but seasoning was spot-on here at least.\n\nMy wife had the Spaniard scramble, which arrived looking more like an omelette gone bad than a scramble. The linguica provided the only seasoning; sadly it was underrepresented and the rest of the dish needed salt.\n\nMy latte was great, and at a $0.50 premium over brewed coffee, can't be beat.\n\nOn both visits, the staff has been a disappointment. Today's server was clearly trained NOT to ask how things were. Either that, or she was oblivious. She didn't return to check in once during our meal and delivered our check silently. The hostess was cute but clueless. I forgot my morning paper in the car, and when I went outside to get it, she welcomed me for a second time when I returned. She did an admirable job of pretending she remembered I'd already been seated in the half-empty restaurant when I told her I had a table, at any rate.\n\nAs a big fan of Cork, BLD has been a tremendous disappointment on two visits. While I'd like to be a regular at one of the spacious booths every weekend, I guess I'll have to settle for a trip to Cork every few months instead.",509,1
"The ladies that actually work at the location are awesome. They are nice and try to keep your mind off the pain while they are doing your treatments. Treatments are effective and you notice results quite quickly.  The office is clean and organized. \n\nHowever, I will tell you NOT to sign up with this company.\n\n1.  Awful scheduling system. If you need to reschedule your appointment or cancel you have to call their corporate head quarters which is not even in Nevada and speak to a representative. \n\nForget even calling to let them know that you are going to be five minutes late because they will not even let the office you are going to know. Which has happened to me already. I was running five minutes late and called their 1-800 number spoke to a representative. She said that she would contact the office in summerlin for me to let them know. I got there and they told me that I had missed my appointment and that I would have to reschedule. I explained to her that I spoke to some one at corporate but on her end there was no communication. So, the lesson is when you make any appointments with them you better get there and time and don't reschedule.  \n\nAnother instance is when their machine went down. A technician called me at 7pm and left a message I called them back only to get an answer machine. It took me 3 days to get a hold of someone at corporate this included emailing and leaving voicemails. They make it seem like it was my fault and couldn't get me in for another 2 weeks because they were already booked with appointments on all the other days.  Don't call me at 7pm and tell me that I need to reschedule after business hours and not even be there to answer the phone when I call back five minutes later. \n\n\n2. Once you sign any contract with them its set in stone! There is no grace period for you to cancel, get a full refund, a partial refund, or a break in contract fine! I've called and argued about this with them and got no where! so ladies, make sure you double and triple check the type of treatment you are getting and the cost before you do anything because you aren't getting your money back. \n\nI signed up for their 3 package deal. Brazilian, underarm, and leg and have been getting treated for these three areas since Feb '13. Everything was fine. Went into my appointments and have been getting appointment reminders stating those exact parts. I called today to reschedule my appointment for the Brazilian and the girl on the phone basically told me that I did not have this package and I only signed up for full leg and face and if I wanted to do the additional two it would be an extra $500 to add onto my existing contract. Which is ridiculous because I know what I signed up for and have been paying for. She then goes to tell me that I have been getting this treatment (brazilian and underarm) for free since feb. I then asked her so you're telling me that since FEBRUARY '13 of this year for the past 7 months there has been no communication between your office and your corporate office. she said that office didn't do their research and at this time we can not continue doing treatments for your brazilian or underarms.\n\nI am so pissed off because now I am left 1/2 treated in those areas and they are not going to do anything about it when it was their mistake. \n\n\nso to recap, its a great deal because they have payment plans which makes laser treatment affordable and cost as much as getting waxed. If they have a groupon that is the best way to handle this company. \n\nThey have left such a bad taste in my mouth that I will never do anything again with them once my contract over.",813,0
"I used to really like Ticoz -- like 3-4 years ago. In fact, I'm surprised I hadn't already reviewed it! Loved the drinks and had two favorite entrees: the grilled burrito with fish and the coconut curry rice with chicken. Both are still on the menu and neither are as delicious as they once were. In fact, they're both kinda gross now! :(\n\nThe grilled fish burrito contains breaded fish and the breading texture is mushy inside the burrito. The flavor is weak.\n\nThe rice is skimpy on the chicken and you are given the option of if you want it spicy or not. It used to just have a nice mild spice to it. Now? Now, it is sweet! Blech! And, if you make it spicy, it's still more sweet than spicy.\n\nSorry to say, I'm in NO rush to go back.  :(",197,1
"I am originally from Charlotte, and was back in town visiting family and friends and a friend of mine suggested meeting here for tapas and drinks this evening.  I could not wait to write this review.\n\nI have not encountered such poor customer service in a very long time, and that's saying something, as I currently live in New York City.  The hostess who \""greeted\"" me was incredibly rude.  I use the word \""greeted\"" very freely.  Basically, she looked me up and down expectantly as I walked in the door.  When I said nothing, obviously expecting a \""Hello\"" or a \""Welcome\"", she proceeded to sigh and grunt out a \""How many?\""  When I explained to her that I was meeting someone and pulled out my phone to text my friend to ask her if she wanted to sit inside or out, I was told, very rudely and abruptly, that the restaurant was \""obviously very small\"" and that she would not seat me  until my party was complete.  Fine.  I understand that many restaurants have this policy.  I was making no complaint.  There's no need for such an attitude.\n\nA bit taken aback by her demeanor, I asked if I could wait at the bar, towards which I was waved with a scowl.  When my friend finally arrived, I tried to settle up with the bartender (for a single seltzer), and he said it was no problem and not to worry about it.  When we approached the hostess to claim a table, she looked at me very accusingly and said, \""Well did you settle your bar tab?\""  \n\nI've worked retail, I've worked food service - I know people have bad days, I know these jobs can really suck sometimes, but there is no excuse for attitude like that.  Especially when I did nothing to provoke it.\n\nThe waitress was competent, but not particularly friendly or helpful in the slightest.\n\nFood was fine, nothing incredible.  And the red velvet cupcake was dry and infinitely forgettable.\n\nI think the management and staff here should seriously rethink their approach to customer service.  Treat your customers well - they're the one and only reason that you're in business.\n\nI will never, EVER come back here.  And I will never recommend this establishment to anyone.",497,0
"Thanks to my bestie, I am hooked to death on their chicken strip basket that comes with a mini sundae of your choice!  In fact, just typing this is making me hanker for it.  \n\nThis is the only DQ close by to my area unfortunately, but it is a big one and very nice.  \n\nI must say though, I have found that the younger kids working here seem to hate having t make the DQ trademark coil when they pump out your ice cream.  Not cool!  :-)",112,3
"So, have you ever been so hungry you needed two onions worth of onion rings? How about a salad the size of your head? Or for the finale, pancakes that hang off all edges of your plate? \n\nPeppermill is definitely for the Adam Richman (Man Vs. Food host) in all of us. One would think with quantity, quality suffers but Peppermill definitely proves that adage wrong. Me and my sis always order pancakes, bacon, and the fruit&granola bowl: all are fantastic. The fruit&granola bowl is about the size of 2 banana splits. Pancakes are HUGE, over 12\"" in diameter (at least) with a fluffy sweetness to them that beg for just a tiny amount of syrup when you dress them with the AWESOME \""stripper\"" sugar sprinkles.\n\nI definitely love this place. The blue neon and comfortable seating and long raised walkways turned into foliage.........somehow makes me believe Peppermill used to be a strip club in a former life.......but who knows ;-). \n\nService is great here: quick, friendly, and very personable. It's reassuring to know that in a city built on transient party goers, at a place centered on the strip, people still remember your name.\n\nGive this place a try.",270,4
"The Phoenix Art Museum is a total treasure. You have to go there when you visit because it has so much inside, all interesting and all educational for young and old.\n\nIf you love Indian rugs and cochina dolls, the Phoenix has more original and beautiful examples than anyone else. And if you want to buy some, they are available in the Gift Shop for a BIG, BIG price. Real, authenticated Indian rugs are worth a fortune these days.\n\nYou can take tours and the tours are wonderful because the tour guides really love their stuff and are glad to share it. You can go over and over again and not be bored, it's that much fun. Plus, it's air conditioned and anyway you can get out of 120 degree heat in the summer is worth it.\n\nGo, you'll be glad you did. Feed your head, will you.",187,4
Great market feel with awesome food. Went here a few times and it was always packed although we wanted these dumplings that was sol there and they had sold out both times we went to taste them so that was disappointing.,44,2

"Probably the best guacamole I've ever had and it was made to order table side. Simple ingredients, but incredibly tasty.  We also had Duck Carnitas Empanada: duck, foie gras, orange, habanero, oregano, mushroom, and queso oaxaca and pork shoulder tacos with a pineapple glaze served with handmade corn tortillas. The tortillas were placed on top of a large brick to keep them warm. We also enjoyed a side of fresh corn made with butter, chile paprika & cotija. It typically comes on the cob, but we made a special request to have it shaved.\n\nVery hipster & trendy vibe.  Right up my alley.  What a great looking group of people dining at this awesome establishment, except none were Asian.  Yeah they're lacking with the Asians in Arizona.  At any rate, I can totally see Bobby Flay dining at this joint.",182,3
"I am not really reviewing the food per se...everyone has had Roberto's, and everyone knows you can find better Mexican food elsewhere.\n\nBut when Tacos El Gordo is closed at 3am, this is the first place some people think of when they want salty mexican food lol.\n\nWe ordered the old favorite, the carne asada fries...which come in a huge tub for about $7-8.  They are huge, and two hungry people can pound em out and not need more.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't busy, so the food came out fairly fast, but their was a little bit of food on the ground and the bathroom was a mess.  They probably run a thin crowd at night, but somebody trashed it and it wasn't cleaned by the time I got there.\n\nIt is a solid place to eat late, but if you are coming down here during the day time, you can do a LOT better",202,1
"Outrageously priced wine list. Aging machos deliver a somewhat efficient but rough service. Food is slightly above average. \n\nOnly bright spots were the tomato and asparagus risotto that I ordered, the fabulous greeter girl and the overall upbeat vibe of the place.",56,1

"Much like general stores that are sadly long gone, Monroe Hardware has it all! \n\nStaff is knowledgeable, patient, and quite friendly.\n\nWhile this isn't a place where I'd buy larger items (toilets, for example), they have a fantastic tool selection - with two lines of tools: cheaper \""throw away\"" tools, and better, American made, tools.  Likewise, they have smaller items, gadgets, etc., that are much better quality (though similarly priced) to what you'd find in big box stores.\n\nThey also have a nice selection of fair priced clothing, including Carhartt.\n\nI haven't priced out their selection of power tools, but again, they favor the better, quality, long lasting, brands (e.g. Echo, Snapper).\n\nJust wished I lived closer to Monroe Hardware :).",185,4
"The main terminal, Terminal 1 is easy to get around and navigate. The new terminal, Terminal 3 is ridiculous. My parents were arriving at gate D40. Living here in Vegas, I know that is part of Terminal 1, so that's where I parked to pick them up and help them with baggage. Wrong.  Apparently, Any airlines listed on the billboards around the airport, arrive into Terminal 1, yet their bags are claimed at Terminal 3.  As a person picking up passengers, there is no way to get to Terminal 3 unless you get back into your car and drive over there.  There are no messages on the arrivals screen indicating which Terminal passengers are claiming their bags at.  Upon leaving last night, the United website indicated departing Terminal - concourse D....well that would mean Terminal 1 because there are no D gates in Terminal 3.  Wrong again. I had to drop them off at Terminal 3 to check their bags in with United, and after going thru security there at Terminal 3, they took the tram over to Terminal 1 to depart. Is this confusing yet?",233,1
"5 STARS because I was really impressed with with the manager.. I guess an employee failed to come in during the busy \""Grand Opening\"". She came to every single table to notify them and also checked up on how everyone and their meals were doing, without being overly bothersome, lol.\nOf course our server was attentive and friendly as well!\n\n5 STARS to the food! \nItems ordered :\n- White Sangria : if you like strong sangria this is the drink for you. They got me at \""papaya\"" but wasn't a fan, imagined it to be more on the sweet side.\n- Mandarin Orange Tangerine Mimosa : Absolute FAVE! Glad my friend got it! Sounded too orangey but it's the perfect blend! High class orange juice, with alcohol, with a little bit of pulp! \n- Almond Brioche French Toast with Almond Butter & Coconut Syrup (made in house) : DELICIOUS! Three thick pieces, moist and very flavorful! Dusted with powdered sugar, topped with coconut almond custard, and comes with raspberry & mixed tropical fruits.. The Almond Butter and Coconut Syrup were just extra icing on the French toast! \n- Belgian Waffles : nothing to special with these waffles, topped with fruit and chose almond butter with maple syrup with it, nonetheless still a good waffle!\n- 36hr Braised Short Rib Loco Moco topped with Lentil Gravy, comes with Eggs to your liking, Fried Rice, & Crispy Onion Rings : NO KNIFE NEEDED! Extremely tender, seasoned well, great textures with the crispy fried onion, fried egg and fried rice (I think I said \""fried\"" too much lol), and overall a great loco moco! \n\n4 STARS to the long drive out there and the water cup with no ice \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af..\n\nStill a great experience!

"I called in my order. The lady taking my order was very rude. Sent my Inlaw to pick up the order that was said to be ready 10 min before he arrived. He first calls to tell me the lady said I did not order wings, I defiantly did because she made sure to rudely correct my \""small order\"" to \""8 piece\"". Five minutes he calls to say something is messed up with the order and neither of the pizzas are half cheese half pepperoni as I ordered. I told him forget it and just take those because I was not going to have him wait even longer. All around very disappointed with the disrespect and lack of attentiveness when taking my order.

"This Marshall's truly has everything....not mention great bargains and great prices. This is one of the few I have seen that sell furniture....paintings... glass sculptures.....rugs....and brass pieces for indoors and outdoors. They also have patio furniture which I imagine is a big seller out here in AZ.  This store is called \""Mega\"" for good reason because the store is huge and spacious so you can move around easy and shop. However I was very disappointed that they don't have a good selection of travel bags or laptop bags.....I have seen much better selection at other Marshall's that were not even as large as this one.

"Since my first Sprinkles experience in Newport Beach, CA I've been addicted. Unfortantely for me I was attending school in Iowa where I experienced severe Sprinkles withdrawal. After graduating one of the major advantages while debating packing up and moving to Arizona was being within a few short miles of Sprinkles. No lie.\n\nThe staff is friendly and are always welcoming. After becoming a regular the staff has even begun to remember cupcake preferences and are helpful in suggesting new flavors.\n\nThe cupcakes are amazing. Everyone I introduce to Sprinkles becomes instantly as addicted as I had on my visit to Newport Beach. I have even found myself anxiously awaiting the various seasonal cupcakes they introduce each month.\n\nWatch out for the lines sometimes, primarily on weekends and when certain events attract visitors to the Phoenix area.

"We stayed almost a week. I actually got married 5 years ago in the \""wedding Bells Chapel\"" beautiful; however, we did not stay here. Naturally I thought the hotel would be beautiful and amazing as well. I was wrong. The appear to be understaffed in that the front desk hardly answered the phone. We had to consistently call for toilet paper and clean towels. The fridge did not stay closed completely so we had to double check to make sure it was closed so food wouldn't go bad. I read other reviews that said it was amazing and had a 24 hour pool.... This was not our experience. I have stayed at. Resorts before and this place does not make the cut. The staff was generally friendly; however, the service left much to be desired. I don't believe the place had sufficient staff to accommodate the vast amount of people this weekend. In order to provide quality service they should correct this immediately or not try to accommodate too many large groups they cannot provide quality service to.",208,1

I'm sorry I didn't know what \""platinum, gold, or silver\"" ment.  It's your job to help people and answer questions. I very calmly called this woman out about her behavior and her response was; \"" I always act like this.\"" I should point out this woman was easily 40 years old not a teenager!!

Although it was very busy, they got our party of 5 (with two toddlers) seated within 10 minutes.  The chips and salsa kept on coming and kept the kiddos happy.

"This place is nice if you want to chill out with your friends, enjoy the sun and pools and drink a few drinks!\n\nMy visit was on a Sunday, it was a Bachelorette party weekend so we had been partying all weekend, there were 12 of us. We had a cabana it came with the usual stuff everyone else has mentioned, a fruit platter, some complimentary water and red bulls and a 500 minimum to spend.  It also had a big tv which was perfect to watch the Laker vs Oklahoma City game GO LAKERS!! \n\nWe laid out, swam, watched the game and relaxed. It was a great time.  \n\nWe ordered some pizzas, tacos, club sandwiches and a few other things everything we had was good. \n\nWe also ordered a bucket drink which came with straws for everyone to drink out of, it had 3/4s bottle of liquor in it - it was very refreshing and had us all feeling good! Note: you can ask for cups to use for individual drinks instead of drinking from the straws which is what we did. \n\nThe only thing I would warn folks about is that when you sit down in the cabana they automatically authorize your card for 500 bucks. Then when they close out your tab they charge the 500 on your card, so basically this can be an inconvenience for some because the authorization for the 500  does not usually fall off your account till the next business day or more. I am not sure if this is the usual way it is done or if our waitress just did the authorization/charge wrong. But anyways, just an FYI! :)",354,2
"You know the Lens Crafters slogan, \""Ready in about an hour\"".  I was waiting at the mercy of the glasses gods, not really in the mood to shop, so I decided to talk a stroll to the other end of the mall for a glass of wine.  I considered each of the different restaurant options, but with the main goal in mind, wine, I opted for Maggiano's.  \n\nThe rest of the mall was sparse, but you would never guess it was a Tuesday night upon entering.  The joint was hopping.  I found a vacant seat at the bar and grabbed their wine list.  I usually start with a white, but my mood was askew due to the onset of cool weather and early sunset.  After a brief study, I requested a glass of Meiomi Pinot Noir.  Score!!  Now, what to do with my hands while I sit here, but of course, an appetizer!  All of my friends can attest that I've been on a calamari quest of late.  Not surprising, I opt for the calamari.\n\nWhile I'm kicking back sipping my savory cherry berry juice, the fellow next to me, a tourist from Connecticut, strikes up a lively conversation.  I discover he works for the Travel Channel, has an exact opposite wine palate from me, and we were both at the same event last Saturday (the Lee's 9th annual Wine Experience).\n\nPerfecto!  Little golden rings cooked to lightly crunchy perfection arrive.  Pair them with Maggiano's famous marinara that suggests nuances of garlic, onion, and basil and I'm one happy camper who forgot she was waiting on anything.  The Lens Crafters notification call comes and goes, but I'm not ready to leave just yet, so I order up another glass of wine.

"The Happy Hour at Kona Grill is definitely hard to beat!  The variety of food specials offered are amazing and there is something for everyone.  Their variety of drink specials is very good.

Their sushi and ahi tuna (cooked rare) is my all time favorite.  The wait staff is professional and very attentive.",104,3
"My wife and I frequent this local bar very often as it is close to home and Happy Hour prices are nicely done..... Always great service.. we usually sit on the patio... great place to go and hang out for a few after work, or on a lazy weekend afternoon.....had the Mediterranean Wrap with Fresh steamed Veggies( don't laugh we're on a fitness program) it was very good for splitting and was fresh and pleasantly tasting... goes to prove you can find healthy food at a local bar lol..............  Been going here off and on for 12 years wont stop!!!",120,3

"It's been over six months since the procedure. I wanted to give my teeth a generous amount of time to settle as much as possible so I could give a fair review. Hopefully the details here will help educate others so they can have a better outcome than I did. \n\nThe Situation: I had two molars with large, old metal fillings that needed to be either re-filled, or likely crowned. I had no pain, no infection, no bite issues, perfectly functioning teeth, just needed to be replaced to prevent future issues. I was going to go with traditional crowns. But my boyfriend had gone to Dr. Miller about two years ago for Cerecs, the \""one day\"" ceramic crowns. They are supposed to save precious tooth structure as they are really bonded onlays instead of wrap-around crowns, and supposedly don't require the shaving down of the tooth that traditional crowns do. I called Miller's office and got a consultation. He was very high on the whole Cerec technology and so, did not discuss any downside to the Cerecs. I decided to give it a try.  \n\nThe Procedure: Cerecs are NOT like traditional crowns. You are permanently bonding ceramic material to your tooth, so it has to be perfect, which involves grinding out the old fillings and prepping the teeth, dusting titanium dioxide powder on the tooth surface, digital 3-D cameras, designing the new onlays with a computer then cutting the onlays in the machine (waiting time), then the first fitting, then baking (more waiting time), then fitting again, build up, bonding, and finishing. And the material is ceramic, not porcelain like traditional crowns, so it cannot be polished once the surface is adjusted, so the surface is not smooth like a real tooth or like a traditional crown. This is important. \n\nBetween the constant pulling on my lip with various tools and the rough treatment during the grinding out of the old fillings, for the first time in my dental patient career, I ended up with a bruised and raw inner lip, badly scraped gums around the new onlays, really messy. Because it took so long in between the first numbing and when they actually bonded the final onlays (he overbooks), I had to be numbed up twice. \n\nFOUR HOURS after I arrived at his office, he was finally done. In pain and pretty shaken up, I was wisked up to the front office and promptly seated in a chair and asked for my credit card. No, \""how are you?\"" or \""how did it go?\"" I think they didn't need to ask as I suspect they already knew that it usually doesn't go very well.\n\nThe Outcome: After the first adjustment is when the severe jaw pain started. Miller said that he would do \""whatever it takes\"" to get the bite right. I came back a second time and found out what he meant...he started grinding down the teeth AROUND the crowns, including teeth that were no where near the area he worked on. Then my bite was REALLY off.  I told him to just stop. Why was he grinding down my other teeth when the only things that changed in my mouth were his two crowns? He pronounced his crowns as \""perfect\"" so it must be that all my other teeth are the problem? Really? He's a nice guy, personality-wise, but this was ridiculous.\n\nThe Aftermath: Because of the bite now being really off, the jaw muscle pain escalated to my throat and neck, along with the tooth pain. I was referred to another dentist from a good friend who really helped me ease the muscle pain. He did not criticize Miller, but nor was he pleased with what he saw; not the margins, the anatomy of the teeth (they are almost without any edges for biting), nor with his grinding down of my good teeth around the crowns. \""It's not like a haircut\"" he said. \""They won't grow back.\"" Luckily, the pain has subsided, but the wide margins will remain for good. Bottom line: Be very cautious with Cerec technology and the dentist who administers it. Or better yet, just go traditional if you can.",867,0
"Ok, so the first time I went to Nachobot I was blown away. First they were open at 3am, second they sell nachos. Not just regular nachos but bomb ass nachos. You can imagine much to my surprise, that when i went there a 2nd time they were not selling nachos. I thought i was the victim of a cruel joke, but nope they didnt have nachos on the menu.

"I stopped by here for lunch because I didn't feel like chipotle...maybe I should have gone to chipotle anyway....I ordered 2 rolls, the 911 roll (this is nine eleven, not nine one one) and the Lion roll.

"I preface this by saying IKEA is an experience not a store, and if you go there expecting to spend less than 1 or 2 hours of your day you will be sadly mistaken.  The first time I went into an IKEA (not this one) all those years ago I had no idea what I was getting into, and after 3 hours of wandering around blindly was scared, lost, and searching frantically for the exit.  It was terrifying.  Since then, I have been back countless times and have a sincere love/hate relationship with it, of which I will share with you here.  So without further ado, grab some popcorn and get comfortable--It's a long read, but hopefully an enjoy able one!\n\nThis IKEA has an extra large parking lot like all of them, so even though you may have a bit of a walk from the door, you can always find a spot.  Honestly, as crazy as Phx drivers are it's probably safer to park farther out and take the sidewalk up the middle.  You're only playing Frogger twice that way, instead of dodging every car whipping into and out of the parking spots as you walk by them.  Pro Tip: Text yourself where you parked.  Trust me on this one.\n\nThis IKEA is set up like pretty much every other one we've been to.  You walk in and immediately take an escalator to the second floor, the \""show room\"" area and cafe, assuming you have no little monsters to drop off at the play zone first.   Yes, they have their own kiddie daycare area.  \n\nThe show room is full of ideas and constantly undergoing changes for new ones.  This is where you walk around and almost wish you had a small 400 square foot flat because of all the amazing ideas they give you for rooms with no room, all while thinking about their crackballs--i mean, meatballs.  Then you remember this isn't Sweden, (or Paris, or London, or NYC, or California, or anywhere else you might actually have only a 250-400 sq ft flat), and move along.  At this point I must note the sheer irony of such a large store, catering to such small homes and apartments.  They also have options for larger rooms, including my dream home library set up and always on display, for which I am currently not in a living arrangement conducive to such things.  Rude.  You also spend this entire level dodging scores of customers wandering around aimlessly, stopping in the middle of the aisles, and generally being irritating.\n\nAfter wandering around the show room for an indeterminate amount of time, if you're lucky, you find your way to the stairs down to the first floor.  This IKEA purgatory.  This is where you become Hamlet and ask yourself, \""To meatball, or not to meatball, that is the question.\""   Yes, those famous IKEA meatballs are within visual (and smelling) range, and it doesn't matter if you're hungry or not.  If you've never had them you wouldn't understand.  I'm not honestly sure if that would make you lucky or unlucky either.  I've been to IKEA on more than one occasion solely for the meatballs.  I am not ashamed.  Don't get me started on the chocolate cake.  It's a slice of heaven, and though it's large enough to share you won't want to.\n\nShould you take the stairs down to the first floor, you reach what we refer to as the \""Oh no, it's a maze of boxes and accessories, and the crazy people from upstairs and the parking lot are driving around shopping carts from hell\"" section.  I'm not joking.  Normal shopping carts have two pivoting wheels up front, and two locked position (typically forward) wheels in the back.  This allows for superb handling and control, and makes sense.  Not IKEA's shopping carts from hell.  Imagine loading potentially 100+ pounds of things you love but had no idea you needed onto a cart with 4 spinning wheels.  FOUR. SPINNING. WHEELS.  Now imagine trying to navigate it around a corner with a boatload of forward momentum (which is equal to mass times velocity), and with oddly shaped items and boxes that extend outside the boundaries of the carts in all directions.  I assure you a cart full of heavy things has plenty of momentum, which you can think of as destructive, wrecking-ball like force.  It doesn't take a Physicist to realize it's probably not gonna go in the direction you want.  Watching a T-Rex making a 90 degree turn at a full run and wiping out completely isn't an entirely inaccurate description.\n\nIf you survive the parking lot Frogger, the show floor maze, the trance-inducing meatballs, and the shopping cart driving T-rexes, you then proceed to the final level of hell--the check out lines.  There are always ample cashiers and lanes, including self-checkout lanes, yet they manage to have lines out the wazoo.  Count on standing in line for at least 10-15 minutes, even if you only have 1 or 2 items.  That may be a conservative estimate.\n\nAt the end, you emerge frazzled, tired, scared, and get to relive the parking lot Frogger experience on the way back to your car.  You get home, love all your stuff, and can't wait to go back for more stuff and ideas.  But mostly, probably for the meatballs.",1187,3

"I have a couple of issues with this place, so I will start with the food first. Myself and my wife met a couple friends here for brunch last weekend. I made the mistake of ordering the \""Potato Hash\"", which turned out to be one of the worst things I've ever eaten period. It's a simple breakfast of eggs over easy, sausage gravy and hash brown potato's. My plate came out with two eggs that had been cooked so long that they were both hard and dry. There wasn't a lick of moisture left in them. The server noticed that the eggs were ruined, and promptly had more made for me. The sausage gravy was terrible. It was some weird super oily concoction that neither resembled gravy nor sausage, which made my burnt potato's even worse. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish. My second issue was my reservation. I made a reservation three days in advance for 11:30am on the patio through \""OpenTable\"". The day before my reservation the restaurant called to confirm everything for the next day. When we arrived, the hostess quickly seated us inside. I explained that my reservation was for the patio. She told us to wait and she would go find out. Several minutes later she came back and informed me that since I made my reservation through \""OpenTable\"", that my request couldn't be honored. WTH? I was told that if you want to sit on the patio, you need to call the restaurant direct, even though on OpenTable there is a box for, wait for it, special requests! Fortunately since I have no desire to return to this typical chain restaurant, I wont need to call the restaurant direct. P.S. I only gave it two stars because of the speed at which the server saw the two hockey pucks on my plate and corrected it.",380,1

"I just wanted to put this out there so if you are thinking about driving clear across town to visit one of these stores(like I did), you do so with a little more info.\n\nFirst let me just say this store is a great little boutique run by a local family.  They are very nice and welcome everyone as they walk in and chat everyone up.  The merchandise is all really unique and they only get 1 or 2 of each size, S,M,L, so you are not likely to run into someone in the same dress..gasp!  Also all the stores have different stock.  Oh, and great prices too.\n\nFor me though, I am 5'10 and a size 8.  Everything is way too short!  I am not into flashing, so this is definitely not for me.  I went in looking for some fun shirts, but they mostly have dresses.  If you are 5'7 or shorter you will just love this place.\n\nOne last thing that I did not see posted nor was it verbally said at purchase, there are no refunds.  They only give store credit.

"Every time I come here the campgrounds seem to have more amenities. There are more covered awnings over the picnic tables(although there are many sites that  are  still uncovered) and now there are little wooden benches around the fire pits of each campsite.\n\nThe pit toilet restrooms have solar panels on top so they power bright white lights inside that help you see in the dark night. Pretty fancy stuff for a bare boneseque campground. You should check out the camp host's solar set up. Impressive!\n\nThere is running water outside the bathrooms to fill up if you run low and your phone will get cell reception in certain areas. At night you can see the Luxor's beam of light shooting high up in the Vegas sky from the campgrounds which is kind of a comforting in a strange way. Nice to know that if you want to party with the people it's a short drive away.\n\nThe close proximity of the fancy schmancy Albertsons which offers decent pre-made sushi and a large selection of craft beers makes campground meals pretty posh when you can easily make a run for steaks or salmon to grill up for dinner.\n\n$15 a night. 2 cars per campsite and as many tents as you can fit into your tiny little plot. As this campground tends to cater to climbers you will often see up to 5 tents crammed into one site. People from all over the world come here to camp and climb. Ive met many people from  New Zealand,Japan, Germany, Switzerland, France and Canada. During shoulder season the campgrounds seem to be completely taken over by Banff Canadians. Good thing Canadians are friendly as we've asked to share a site of some strangers but now friends because the campgrounds were full.  They let us squeeze one more tent on their site.",376,3

"I'm with Ashley A. on this one. First time to this salon but I won't be back. \n\nWent to have my legs waxed. Was actually able to secure a next-day appointment which was awesome. But the interaction with Marianne was odd, uncomfortable, and at times, scary. \n\nWhen I walked in, she poked her head out and said her wax was still warming up and it would be a few minutes. That happened several times. I had to wait nearly 40 minutes. When she finally came out to get me, she explained it was new wax, she'd been having problems with the machine, and there was a power outage earlier. She spoke so fast that I can't remember what else she said. Wish she'd called me ahead of my scheduled time to tell me about the delay so I could have done something productive with those 40 minutes. \n\nWhen she finally escorted me into the salon room, she started rambling about a homeless guy who'd stolen her business computer so she had to get a new one. Then said he was out to get her. It was seriously weird. Especially weird she'd be telling a new customer all these things.\n\nWhen she finished the waxing (and her odd stories), I pointed out several areas where I could see hair. She went over those again but said sometimes the wax pulls out only half the hair so you're basically left with stubble. I don't know if that's true or not but I was okay with just getting out of there. Fast.\n\nWhen I went to pay, just like she did with Ashley A., she said she couldn't accept a credit card because her computer was new. She suggested I sign up for some service (kind of like paypal) and submit payment that way. When I inquired about the service, she said she wasn't able to pull it up on her computer. So she told me there was an ATM nearby and I could go there. At this point, I was convinced wherever this ATM was, so would there be someone waiting for me. Yes, the paranoia had completely set in. \n\nUltimately, I went to a bank nearby, pulled out cash, drove back over to Naked, handed her money and high-tailed it out of there. \n\nI don't know what is going on with this woman but things just didn't feel right.

"I would love to see this bar succeed.  I think a couple of things I feel they could do better.  \n\nA couple of criticisms -  \nFood:  Flatten out the chicken for the chicken sandwich.  Makes it a lot easier to eat and stays on the roll better.  \n\nService/Waitstaff:  Although I think the service is over all good.  They aren't that exciting.  Often times I go in there and other than my order, I literally say 3 words to the bartender.  It's the bartenders job to keep people coming back.  They need to strike up conversations to make the visitor feel that they are important and create a fun atmosphere.  Also you will never get the night crowd if most of your waitstaff at night are men.  It's sexist to say it I know, but this is reality.  Zipps is crowded for a reason.  It's not that they have the best food in the world but they have a nice looking waitstaff.  \n\nAtmosphere:  That Jukebox needs, I stress NEEDS to be on at all times. Music is the key to conversations, mood, and attitude.  Without it, it will suck the life out of your bar.  One of my visits there were with 3 people at the bar and no music playing.  No one was talking. No one looked happy.  I threw in a couple of dollars in the jukebox and saw a transformation that you wouldn't believe unless you were there.  All of a sudden you have people talking, laughing and when other people came in you could instantly see them digging the vibe.   Flanny's is pretty big concrete and airy.  Meaning there isn't much to deaden the sound.  So if there isn't any music playing it's awkwardly silent and all you hear is a sports game on the speakers.  I guess you could say, well put some money in the jukebox then.  Most people are not confident enough to be that first person to enter in their song selection.  So in reality by not having the jukebox playing you are actually losing commissions on your jukebox sales.  Assuming they are getting commissions.  Either way people will leave when they are bored.\n\nI will keep going back to Flanny's for sure. But it would be nice to see them continue to listen to their visitors.",510,2

We went in on Good Friday and there wasn't a soul in the store.  We ate a full meal and still no one came in.  The wait staff and owner seemed relieved.  I think this place does amazing business during the day.  Not to mention, the lovely waitress told us stories of how she took 3 parties the other night.\n\nThe food here is amazing.  My wife and I shared the smoked fish platter (which is $10 less than chompies and almost twice the size) My dad had the liver and onions which to him is food for the soul.

My only complain would be the unnecessary scoop of butter (or some kind of rub alike) on the top. \n\nThe price was pretty decent in comparison with other steak houses.\n\nRemember that it's a new place so they have to work in tuning things up but all in all, it's a great addition to Chandler and I'll definitely go back.\n\nMaybe next time I'll sit a the bar to review that section of the place.\n\nCheers.",328,3
"We used to come here a lot when they first opened. Great outdoor patio area with some familiar bartender ladies from the strip. Live music, drinks and good happy hour apps. Some nights this place would be crawling with cheesy timeshare salesmen and desperate cougars...sooo NOT cute but makes for some mild entertainment.\nMango Madness martini was good & came in a little shaker, don't fall for $12 blue martini...you're paying for glow stick. Fave apps include ahi, margarita pizza, chicken skewers, not bad for bar food.\nStill one of the best happy hours though.\n50% off drinks & apps 4-8pm and located in Town Square so you can leave and go somewhere else if you're not feeling the vibe.",159,2
"Meh.  In my quest to visit EVERY brewery in Wisconsin, I had to stop at Capital Brewery.  I previously tried some of their beers at the MKE Brewfest and was semi-impressed by the new Imperial IPAs so I wanted to give some of their other beers a try.  I don't know if it's because we came on a day where there was a 5K or what, but the brewery was pretty much closed except for the beer garden and the little store inside.  There were no samples or flights offered and you could only get a pint for like $6 outside.  Bah.  We wanted to try something new so we had an Autumnal Fire and the Appleanche Dopplebock.  We weren't impressed with either one.  Frankly, the Appleanche was just weird.  It smelled like an apple cider and tasted like an average ale.  The Autumnal Fire was decent but nothing special.  I totally committed alcohol abuse and threw half of my beer away.  *GASP* \n\nSadly so, I expected more from Capital and don't think I'd stop back in next time I'm in Madison when there are breweries like Ale Asylum nearby.",256,2
"A great place for brunch and quite inexpensive too! I love the freshly-made Bosnian bread and the cevapi, though the green salad that came with it was lackluster. The Bosnian coffee that I ordered with the meal was strong and was the perfect beverage for the brunch. Service was friendly but slow, which was surprising since there was only one other table that had diners during our visit.",81,3
"Just a so-so dim sum eatery.  Small selections of what is actually dim sum  and even at happy hour prices not priced well at all.  Lots of other choices on the menu, but if you are going to call yourself a dim sum place have dim sun.  The Bao buns were miniature, shumai (?spelling) was on the cool side and a bit dry.  They didn't mess up the shrimp.  Clean and fairly efficient wait staff; only one spoke broken English making them seem standoffish.  Won't go back.",116,1
Felt like we came home to a spotless hotel room. Very professional and a FANTASTIC job for a out of this world good price. 3 ladies did a deep clean in 3 1/2 hrs and the house has never been cleaner. Thanks for the great work! We will be calling again before Xmas and may even consider a monthly agreement.,73,4
"the music was good, but didn't knock my socks off.\n\nThere are TONS of tickets - so no need to rush out and get them in advance - decide the day before or morning of, and get tix from your hotel concierge.\n\nA few good songs, if you are from that era - but I didn't recognize most of them.  The best set (or most interesting) was the last one in the first half, when you had the perspective of being on stage with them-that was pretty cool.\n\nIt wasn't really much of a story; the plot was more like a second thought used only to link the songs together.  Maybe I am just not a broadway person, but it's hard to get into stage overdramatics.\n\nI found the choreography very repetitive, but then again that's probably the case with groups.\n\nThe audience tended to comprise mostly older folk (50+) who I assume are more familiar with the music.",212,1
"If I could award 6 stars I would.  Probably one of the best collections of pinball anywhere.  They have one of the two Pinball Circus machines in existence. Need I say more?  The cool things:  Bottled water in a vending machine - .50 cents.  The crane games have toys you can actually grab.  It isn't just pinball, they also have EM (Electromechanical) arcade games from the 60's and 70's.   Tim is a nice guy, a bit odd and stand-offish to strangers at first but he soon warms up to you.",130,4
"I cannot believe the high ratings this place had. Granted, I got it to go by the slice, here is my story:\n\nI was nursing a pretty sick hangover. It was around 3pm. Staggering back to my room at the Luxor, from my friends room at Mandalay Bay, I passed by Slice of Vegas, and was drawn in, if by nothing but the fact it would be quick and to go. There was no one in line. I placed my order, as did about 10 people that lined up behind me. It wasn't until all 10 had been placed that cashier started to dish out slices from the case which I had until this point figured had been for display only. I mean why else would it have not been served as soon as I ordered it? About 20 minutes later, everyone's orders placed she began throwing the slices out. my room was a brisk 3 minute walk away, and by the time I arrived the slice was cold. It didnt even look appetizing. Didnt taste any better than it looked. It had that concession stand pizza taste, only older.\n\nMuch better options for a quick bite to eat, maybe you have to get the whole pie to not have a horrid experience?",263,0
"Bon service. La cuisine est correcte, sans plus",11,2
This place is a joke! Margaritas - BLAH! No alcohol in them. Chips/Salsa - BLAH! We complained to the waitress and she just blew us off. We didn't even order a meal...we just left. I will never go there again. What a waste of money!,63,0
"Not sure why I intuitively hold fancy restaurants in the middle of big casinos to such a high standards.  When I see $$$, I expect to be wowed.  The food quality did not match the price tag.  There was nothing special or unique about the presentation of the food.  The only wow factor is that they charge $9 for miso soup and $12 for two pieces of salmon.  You can get far better food for way less money.  Though we did not order any of the sushi rolls, they seemed relatively creative as far as sushi rolls go.  The staff was helpful and pleasant and the food came fairly promptly.  They focused on trying to sell us all of the spicy sushi rolls.  I am guessing this is a specialty for them.  Glad to see that other Yelpers have had somewhat better experiences.",172,1
"I'm not sure how fair it is to rate Tivoli VIllage since it's only 1/3rd finished, but I suppose I can always update it. This place is definitely beautiful in it's architecture, but I am anxious to see what other stores are going to pop up. The only store that really caught my eye was Charming Charlie's while the other boutiques are old news to Las Vegas because these aren't their first locations. My favorite part of TIvoli Village is the kid's park with a yogurt place right next door! Unfortunately, I don't see many other reasons to visit until it is completed.",133,2
Crappy service and the food was terrible,9,0
Wow. Awesome place. Small - great casual atmosphere. Great local beer in tap (didn't catch the name). Started with the Spiedini appetizer. We contemplated ordering a second dish of it as it was so good. The came the pizza. We ordered the wiseguy - with mushrooms. It was phenomenal. The one pizza was more than enough for the two of us. Highly recommend this place!  You won't be disappointed.,91,4
"Service was good, everyone was friendly and the sushi is good and the prices are great! The happy hour is a good deal. The outside area needs tending, clean Windows, sweep up cigarettes and wipe down tables and chairs. I would still come back...",52,2
"won us over the first girls' brunch we had there. I am not even a pancake person but you better believe I get a pancake every single time I go. Don't forget to ask what the pancake of the day is! \n\nThey recently revamped their menu.. I know it was recent because I went a week ago and it happened in between then and Saturday morning. They added a ton of delicious stuff. I tried the caprese eggs benedict a little worried I made a terrible decision. Alas, the food came out and I did not make a terrible decision. The egg was cooked perfectly. Execution: flawless. Devour time: 4 min. \n\nThe only thing I hate is the wait time but I guess that is a good thing..for them. Always packed. They just implemented a new system to let you know your table is ready though; they text you which is great.. You can go walk around the shops while you wait.\n\nDon't forget to try a beermosa.",212,3
"We have gone to this Pizza Hut in the past and were not satisfied with the service. When we first moved to our house, this location and the one at Lawyers & Margaret Wallace both argued as to which location was supposed to deliver to us! We didn't feel like leaving the house last night and decided to give them another chance. They were 20 minutes late, the pizza and wings were cold, and the customer service was terrible! I will not be ordering from this place again. I am really surprised this location has been in business as long as it has.",117,0
"like this place. I particularly like that it is NOT the typical Mexican refried beans, with blobs of cheese kind of Mexican place. Instead it seems to be more Southern Mexican food with Black beans (my favorite), and even things like \""Fried RIPE Plantains\"" something you usually only find in Cuban or Salvadorean or Honduran restaurants. So thumbs up for this place. And the Margaritas are great. Just not a huge fan of the high chair tables that make up most of the restaurant. Doesn't make it very convenient to go there with young kids. but they DO have some regular tables with normal chairs too. so if you bring kids, make sure you reserve one of the lower/normal tables ahead of time.",150,3
"Wow! I am so glad Miss Alison suggested this place while we were in town. She's vegan and they have plenty of options for her. We came here with friends for dinner after Day 1 of selling at Handmade Arcade. We got there just in time since it got packed shortly after we sat down. There was a slight language barrier, so instead of getting the chicken with crispy noodles, I got tofu, but you know what? I didn't even notice until 5 minutes after eating and then I looked across the table at my friend Jessica's dish that clearly had chicken and we had ordered the same thing. Oh well. I don't regret it at all. It was delicious and I ate every bite. Also the vegetable gyoza we started with was very tasty. Will definitely add this into my rotation of Pittsburghian restaurants I hit up when I am there. I heart Pittsburgh!",185,3
"There Pizza was delicious, I thought it was a little pricey for 4 Pizzas with one topping we spent $70.00 The person that took our order, could not speak very good english, in fact he was rude. I would not recommend this place to eat at all. Find another restaurant in the Village.",67,1
"Edible Arrangements are a great gift for somebody who likes great food, and ideal for somebody who doesn't need more stuff. The fruit looks tempting and tastes delicious, with or without the yummy chocolate covering. \n\nI have ordered twice from this company, both times online. In each case, delivery was prompt and the gift was oh so welcome. Edible Arrangements are now the go-to gift for me to send a couple of people in my family.\n\nPrices are kind of high, but I actually end up spending less for an Edible Arrangement than I would for flowers or other gifts. And I know that the Edible Arrangement will be enjoyed--I can't always say the same about clothing, household gifts, or even flowers. \n\nA word about ordering something perishable that you will never see: This business has delivered exactly what I ordered, even though I was ordering from out of state.",187,3
"I have had to downgrade my rating after numerous trips there. Today was the straw that broke this camel's back. I was there before the lunch rush. There was one other customer, she was being helped.  The three other employees ignored me for a good two minutes.  One was absentmindedly playing with her phone.  I ordered the chicken vegetable faro soup and a vegan chocolate chip cookie.  The service is just so hipster, I'm-too-cool-to-work vibe that I honestly can't take it anymore.  Every transaction with every employees is just cold and unfriendly, but yet I still feel guilted to write in a tip on the tip line.  Got back to my office to eat my soup, and it was nearly all watery broth.  What a kick in the teeth.  At least my cookie was good...",177,1
"We love to go here and sit at the sushi bar or if we're with a group we do table service.   The basic rolls are all terrific -- as are the more exotic. (We liked the Chop Chop/Lake Mead Roll/Johnny Roll(no rice on Johnny - wrapped in cucumber!). The Honey Roll is deep fried and fabulous -- just let myself have 1 piece and savored it!)  Outstanding service and terrific sushi. Just a great choice if you love sushi -- even if your budget, like ours, doesn't allow frequent sushi indulgence. (They have some special rolls on a promotional menu.)",126,3

"Copycat is a great place to go to fulfil all of your photocopying needs!\n\nSituated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh, Copycat is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to get to. \n\nCopycat has been a bit of a life saver for me these past few years as I have frequently come here when I needed to urgently photocopy something and the University library was closed. It costs around 10p per sheet of paper to photocopy, so it is quite pricey, but if you are in a panic to photocopy something, this is the place to go. \n\nAs well as photocopying, Copycat also does printing, designs, labels and Shirt and rubber stamp prints. The staff are really friendly and helpful here as I have had numerous problems trying to work their photocopying machines and a very lovely lady showed me (to my embarrassment!) exactly what to do.\n\nCopycat is a bit of a walk from the University so it isn't the handiest of places for students to get to, but if your photocopying or printing need is urgent, it is the ideal place.",237,2

The owner and the staff are really nice people but my emotions from this place has ranged from not bad to this sucks over the last few visits.\n\nThe last time I was there my burger and fries were gnarly bad. The fries were not cooked and tasted like oil and the burger had me thinking what was I thinking by coming here for lunch.

Went here for the Bloody Mary bar but the breakfast itself was delicious!! This is such a good choice for breakfast/brunch in Vegas that isn't a buffet.  I got the special of the day which was lemon crepes with blueberries and homemade whipped cream.  Will definitely be back here!,61,4
"This place use to be a Wendy's for years since I lived down the street. Still, they made it look nice on the inside (they have a drive thru!) and they even had a man playing his versions of classic rock songs on guitar which was nice. The Hostess was also our server and she was super nice (Go Erin!). \nWhen a girlfriend of mine and I walked in we saw the specials for the day and when I saw avocado curry I was sold since I'm addicted to avocados. We got the lettce wraps which was good (wish it didn't come with iceburg though) and got it simply because it came with I believe their sweet and sour sauce AND the peanut sauce. LOVE peanut sauce.\nFrom what I saw, they had a full bar. Beer selection was good, nothing on tap though which makes me a sad panda. I had to order the thai tea which was very good and tried the thai coffee, also good.\nAvocoda curry was amazing! Though when I got the bill I was sad to see that it cost $18... I understand that when they say it's the special, it means that they don't serve it on their everyday menu.\nI'll most def be back, very good place!\nP.S. Came on a Monday night.",273,3
"Very nice interior design, but I think their menu isn't that great. It is very limited, pricey, and the food quality doesn't live up to the price you pay for your meal. We came in as soon as it opened, and the service was very sluggish. I was always running low on water, and I had to battle for the watress' attention to get a refill (when we were practically the only people there). \n\nI ordered their crispy calamari tossed for $8.00. It was mixed with black peppers. It was good, and the gave it a different flavor to the typical calamari appetizer. I also ordered the chicken milanese with arugula salad and asparagus for $14.00. That was ok. The breading on the milanese was indifferent and I only had 4 pieces of asparagus (and I love asparagus). \n\nI think my experience was just a one time only deal. I just feel like the service didn't make up for the quality in their food. The hostess seemed confused , on top of being on her phone upon checking in. The manager was nice enough to offer us free dessert, and I thought that was a very nice gesture of him.",257,2

"Yum! I came here with my boyfriend and a couple of friends from Namibia (southwestern Africa) for the lunch special. $22 prix fixe with an appetizer, entree and desert.\nI had the crab cake (extra $), the shrimp sagnaki and the walnut cake. The crab cake was delicious with a smooth mustard emulsion and gigantes beans for a little texture. The shrimp sagnaki was nice as well, though it could have used a little more feta. The walnut cake was amazing. I was ready to pop because of the richness of the previous two dishes but I got through about 98% of the cake. Moist, tasty and with a frosting that didn't over power. I want some now!\nConsidering one could easily spend almost $22 on a drink in this town, getting a meal of this caliber for that price is incredible. \nFor folks for whom money is no object Milos has a fish market set-up where you can pick through Mediterranean-caught fish (caught yesterday!) for market price.",214,2

"Been a member for about 3 months now and so far so good.

"First visit--January. 4  star review. Please read the most recent review, further below...\nREALLY surprised about this place. First off--the decor was swanky and the servers were young(-er than the usual diner folks). The menu was short--which is a good thing--and the prices were very reasonable.\n\nI ordered the 2 eggs (scrambled), with hashbrowns (homemade!), meat (bacon) and coffee. The eggs were fluffy, the hashbrowns were delicious, and the bacon was very tastey.\n\nAnother of the group ordered the blueberry pancakes--which were both delicious and pretty to look at. Cake-like, but crispy on the edges, delicious.\n\nThis diner is open 24/7 and is in a great location!\n*******************************************************************\n***Re-visit 3/13/11, ONE STAR REVIEW\nOk so after a fun night at a couple of bars and a good nights sleep... we headed (with a group) over to Queen City Diner, excited to revisit and have some of their delicious food. Um... I really wish we would have gone somewhere else. I give this place less than a month to stay open. Here's why:\n\nWarning sign #1: No cream for the coffee. They ran out and didn't have anything but 1% milk.... sounds like their distributor isn't delivering for a reason--they might not be able to pay their bill? Anyways--no cream for coffee isn't something that should EVER happen in a diner.\n\nWarning sign #2: Understaffing. Why in the world wouldn't you be full or even overstaffed at a downtown diner the day after the largest bar crawl in the world????\n\nWarning sign #3: Everyone was \""new\"" and that was the excuse they gave for poor service, long wait times, running out of coffee (yeah they didn't have any reserves), and the kitchen screwing up orders.\n\nWarning sign #4: Loooooooooooooooooooooooong wait times. Some of our party waited OVER 10 minutes for their DRINKS to arrive. And they weren't \""busy.\"" Our food took over an hour. Did I mention they weren't busy? Also--when they finally brought out the food, they brought out everyone's EXCEPT for one persons.... oh yeah, it's because the kitchen forgot to make that order.\n\nWarning sign #5: The kitchen screwed up at least 4 of the 9 orders... and when they were delivered wrong--the staff IGNORED us. And they never bothered to bring the hashbrowns that I ordered even though they were reminded over 5 times.\n\nWarning sign #6: The food quality was... poor. The last time we ate there the food was excellent--thick cut bacon, fluffy eggs, homemade hashbrowns, delicious and light pancakes.... this time--the bacon was obviously cheaper and thinner (and had less taste and they served less of it), the eggs were \""meh\"" and NOT fluffy, the hashbrowns (which someone else gave me a taste of since they never brought me mine) tasted like the frozen patties you get at the grocery store that they just put in a food processor (not the best). Oh did I mention there was no cream for the coffee?\n\nWarning sign #7: When the time for the check came--I spoke up (again) about our orders STILL not being right--the fact they never delivered my hashbrowns or my boyfriends biscuits. We were going to get a \""discount.\"" WHen the waitress FINALLY brought us our checks--I was shocked--a measly 10% that didn't even cover the cost of my MISSING HASHBROWNS. When it was pointed out to our server that I was not happy about this, and that I felt that after this bad experience that there should definitely be more of a discount, I was ignored. I shouldn't have paid them, I realize that now. \n\nI was completely astounded at this place today. Several people got up and left--one couple was very angry (their orders were also messed up AND they waited a long time). The thing is--they HAD the staff today... but it seemed only one person was doing the work--our poor server, Hannah (bless her heart). HANNAH--you might want to find another place to work, just a tip, you're a sweet girl and a good waitress, unfortunately the rest of the staff is what made run around frustrated today! The shift manager delivered food... but mainly stood around and watched Hannah hustle around frantically as she was the only waitress working... along with what appeared to be a bartender/drink lady person who didn't bother to make coffee, refill drinks, or help make any drinks like it appeared she should have been doing. Oh and she was constantly rolling her eyes and frowning. I think this lady and the (un) friendly greeter should both be doing something else besides customer service. \n\nMy tip? DON'T GO HERE. It's overpriced for the quality, you'll waste a LOT of time, and you will not be treated well as a customer. I will NOT ever go back to this place. Sorry QC Diner--but your presentation today was absolutely pathetic.",1122,0
"Getting ready to leave on a flight home the next morning, we would get a small snack and drink at Chili's which was located a block from our hotel.  Have gone to our neighborhood's Chili's which I consider just an average restaurant.  We sat in the bar area.  It was just before 4 pm and the waitress came back and said that it was Happy Hour and the appetizers were $4.99.  We ordered 2 - one flat bread pizza and some kind of nachos.  I was surprise of the size of the plates.  We were totally satisfied.   The service and 2 of the staff we dealt with were so nice.  Can pay electronically from the table which we really liked.  Highly recommend for a snack or bar drink.",162,4
"This place has the potential to be great but they need to work out the kinks in the kitchen and better train the waitstaff first.  Dined here Saturday night with another couple and the meal was pretty awful.  Service was good from friendly waitstaff but they don't know enough about the menu to be very helpful.  We've dined all over the world but still had questions about the eclectic menu; our poor waitress had to go back to the chef several times to ask what ingredients were or how things were prepared.  Our bruschetta app was burned black and our server kindly returned it to be refired - but really, burned toast is a very easy thing to quality control and it never should have left the kitchen.  Other entrees experienced similar problems.  Overall, not worth it.  I hope they fix things before they ruin their own reputation because it's an ambitious enterprise.",185,1
"I'm another who wanted to love this hotel, but just couldn't.\n\nI'll spare you the minor details (unhelpful personel/ rude bartenders) and get to the nitty gritty.\n\nUpon first entering my room, after a long wait to check in, I headed straight to the bathroom to relieve myself. As I was looking down, I was astonished to find dried urine marks on the toilet. Yes, housekeeping took the time to fold the first sheet of toilet paper into a nice, little, pointed tip, but decided cleaning up the last guest's misfire, was not top priority...gross. \n\nLater, I hop into the shower and find mold at the bottom of each corner. This surprised me even more than the pee stains. This was not something that was overlooked once, but habitually. That shower hadn't seen a full cleaning in MONTHS... really gross. I don't even want to think about how often they actually change the sheets. *cringe*\n\nOk so the housekeeping staff needs to change their eyeglass prescriptions, but how is the room service?\nThis is something (among many other things) that I really appreciate about the Venetian, which has exceptional room service. When I pay $25 for a sandwich, I expect it to be at least a few steps above something I'd get at Chili's. The Mandalay however, did not fulfill this expectation. Late one night, I ordered a corned beef reuben, which I looked forward to for the entire HOUR+ that I waited for it. \""Man, it's going to be so good\""...NOT. Fucking terrible. The meat was so tough, I couldn't even bite through the sandwich. \n\nThe final straw came when I went to pick my car up from valet. It's a push start, so the key doesn't need to be in the ignition to drive. This apparently caused too much of a mental overload for the valet service. One of the drivers must have tucked the key in his pocket and forgotten to tag it. I waited close to 20 minutes before I was informed that they could not find my key. They then proceeded to try to convince me that I had not actually turned in my key. After assuring them multiple times that I'm not a fucking idiot and that I had turned in the key, the driver had an epiphany of sorts and proclaims \""oh, I bet I know where it is\"". Great, thanks genius. He headed inside to the lockbox, where they had apparently stored the key, because somebody was too lazy to backtrack and figure out to which car it belonged. \n\nI'm GIFTING this place 3 stars, seeing that it's not a total dump and actually has potential to be a great hotel. But considering the poor service, all the fees and overall price, Mandalay Bay leaves much to be desired. I'd rather pay the extra cash to stay at the Venetian (my default Vegas hotel).",632,2
"Was at Surrender for MDW to see Calvin Harris, bought prepaid tickets which got us in fast, despite arriving at the scene at 11:30pm. After entering the club hassle-free, the excitement quickly dwindled. \nThe concept of having 80% of the club outdoor is nice, however the implementation was poor. Calvin Harris was playing at the indoor portion of the club, except no one was allowed on the dance floor except if you purchased a $3000 table. Why even let people in if you don't allow anyone on the dance floor? Waste of money on cover, and it wasn't like the cover was cheap either; $100 for guys and $40 for ladies. Go somewhere else to have a  good time.",163,1
"Two words:  Chocolate martini.  Yes, this place has good food, live music, and the most eclectic mix of people you'll ever see in Scottsdale, but I go there for the Chocolate martinis.  Where else can you watch football, listen to reggae music and have wings all in one night?  If you want a place where it's always the same, this isn't it.  I've heard 80's music one night, reggae another, and country yet another.  The place is always busy and if nothing else, it's a great people-watching place.  The bartenders are the best and the food is good.  Check it out if you're in the neighborhood.  Is it worth driving out of your way for?  Probably not, but it's a solid place to go if you're in the area.",185,2

"Terrible food, slow service with attitude. Don't waste time or money on this place. Ordered two appetizers, both disgusting. The smell and taste of old grease was awful. Ordered a coke and beer. The coke was just soda water. Told the waitress and she said, \"" I know, we are busy.\""  How about serve us water and say the coke needs to be changed. I guess they are use to serving SLOP.",90,0
"My recent lunch at Del Piero was pretty lackluster. The restaurant, a small eatery inside the Queen Creek Olive Mill, the Valley's first working olive farm and mill, attracted an older crowd (people in their 40s to 60s).We even saw someone wearing  a colorful muumuu,  which served as a loud reminder that we were in the Q.C. and not the O.C.\n\nThe options at del Piero are slim -- paninis, sandwiches and salads. There's no soda fountain, but the eatery serves up iced tea, lemonade and the hard-to-find Jones flavored sodas. My panini was blah and didn't wow, but I enjoyed sampling the olive bar. Be sure to try the large olives stuffed with Feta. I could have filled up on these alone! If you're up for a road trip (it took us nearly 40 minutes to get there from Tempe!), Del Piero is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays\nthrough Sundays. It's  $5-$9 sandwiches, paninis and salads",236,1
Went for the All you can eat sushi for $25. Salmon skin was outstanding. Does not include all the rolls but does include sashimi. Will definitely be going back. Some else posted a picture of what is included from 2012 but it is the same in 2014.,64,4
"Watch out I hop here comes babystacks!! I rarely go out for breakfast but when I do , it better be good. Baby stacks was just that, great pancakes fair prices and huge portions. Had the banana pancakes full stack which were amazing. Syrup is sweet but not too sweet. The full stack was gigantic and was enough to tide me over for the whole day. The place gets VERY crowded on the weekend but it's great food so that's to be expected. All the staff was very friendly and provided prompt service. WILL GLADLY GO BACK for their red velvet pancakes.",119,3
"It has been 10 years since I attend HOB Gospel Brunch and I took my friend who had never attended and we were both blown away. Now there are some glitches but first the outstanding points:\n\n1. The food - it is yummy Southern home cooking - from the waffles to the made-to-order omelet station to prime rib to huge already peeled shrimp. The coffee is good as well as the mimosas.  The bread pudding was to die for - and there were plenty of salads, sides and I really loved the Mac and Cheese.\n\n2. The music - it is unbelievable - the energy, the love, the power. It inspires me and I didn't want it to end. The show is interactive and you just want to get up and dance.\n\n3. The atmosphere - you can carry on a conversation and still enjoy the music. You do sit family style and meet some very nice people. Com'n it is like going to church - you really don't need your own table.\n\nNow the glitches:\n1. Seating - originally I was seated at a table designed for 2 which had 2 additional chairs added to make it seating for 4. Once the drinks were brought, I knew I would be eating off my lap. I did look around and saw some empty seating (this was 1:30 so everyone had been admitted) and they did move me. However, seating for 2 is seating for 2 - at $40 a person, who wants to eat holding their plate or off their lap.\n\n2.Service - now this is not the servers' fault - everyone was moving - more help is needed. I had to have my friend go to the bar to get our refills and the plates stacked up at our table of 8. Again, I am not faulting the staff - HOB - you need to add a few more - even part-time.\n\n3. The Wait - be prepared to wait with long lines. I loved the waffles but it was truly the longest wait I ever had for waffles. \n\nI would still go back - I did give it 4 stars - but be prepared for long lines and see about sitting on the main floor instead of the second level.",476,3
The food was okay. The crumb cake they serve hot was amazing but the eggs Benedict was just average.,22,1
"I usually LOVE Carrabas, but this location won't be seeing me again anytime soon. \n\nThey were out of crayons and had a cocktail menu that was only 3 drinks deep. Sound like a good combo to you?  No crayons? No drinks? Don't they know what a mom needs?! :) I asked for a drink list. They stared at me confused and pointed to the 3 drinks. \n\nOur server was most likely new. We were at a round table, yet he leaned over the entire front of me and my full plate to fill my husband's tea, placing his armpit neatly over my face. He didn't bring bread or silver wear until we asked. But he was nice, which IS important. \n\nIt's been about a year since I've been to a Carrabas. Not only have the names of some entrees changed, but so have the portion sizes. Down with size, up with price. Nice. My husband always enjoys paying $16 for a handful of pasta and pasty sauce. \n\nI got the Caesar salad. Limp, room temperature, gross. Not typical of what I'm use to from this chain . Also, the spices they put on the plate with olive oil for the bread was super salty. \n\nMy youngest was offered broccoli but they came back to say they were out. It happens. The kids pizza was bordering burnt - 0.5/4 slices were eaten. \n\nWe ALWAYS get calamari. This time it was fried too long. I think we got the bottom of the bag because the pieces were tiny and extremely greasy. Shiny greasy. Grease. \n\nYou know that awesome lemon butter and pepper sauce they serve with the calamari? It was unrecognizable. Like a small bowl of yellowish brownish oil. Kinda looked like Papa John's new garlic crud (not the nice creamy one from the 90's), but still tasted ok.  More grease. \n\nAnyway, when I am spending money that took me more than a day to earn, I really want my money's worth. Didn't happen. Won't give them another chance. I worked hard for that bill! \n\nAs always the bread was good. My Coke was good. \n\nThe tiramisu was super good. 2 stars good. I really want another piece.",512,1
"I was hoping that the new location, with the potential of the off-street patio, would be better than the old one. The coffee is okay, though neither good nor hot.

1 star is being to generous! My dog just left the groomers and I am pissed! Her nails arent trimmed or filed!

"Is this becoming a nationwide trend? It's apparently the age of the chain gastropub. And I gotta say, I like it.\n\nCulinary Dropout is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts conglomerate of restaurants; the original Culinary Dropout is in Fox's homebase of Scottsdale. I can haz franchising rights in Texas?\n\nI'd heard good things about Hard Rock's atmosphere, and while that mostly disappointed, Culinary Dropout was a fine time. We made reservations for 9 people on a Saturday night, which were completely unnecessary. The restaurant was about half-full, though part of the reason is it's huge with a great, casual patio.\n\nWe immediately got a free serving of Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue--delicious--a result of a duplicate order. Great start. I was mostly drawn to the impressively diverse, if pricey, beer menu. Woe is me; instead of embracing diversity, I ended up sticking to the very delicious Joseph James lager all night. There's some good stuff on there, and if you've lost all your money gambling on the tables there's also a \""paper bag special\"" for $3. Our waitress described it as Bud Select or something of that ilk; we stayed away but I found it cheekily fun.\n\nMenu prices are quite reasonable after getting eye-gouged by the Vegas exchange rate. The Meatloaf--my choice, was exceptionally large and quite filling. Ends were more than a little burnt, but I enjoyed the \""meaty\"" part and enjoyed the sides. The Shaved Prime Rib Dip got huge raves from our waitress, who was excellent all night, as well as my fellow diners who ordered it. The Fish & Chips and 36-Hour Pork Ribs were called as decidedly average.\n\nIt's a really great ambiance, and if the Hard Rock had more of the \""zoo\"" atmosphere that I was promised, I think the night would've been even better. As it is, it's a short cab ride from the strip and was still a great time regardless.",438,3
"This is the neighborhood Foodland that has the bare necessities needed to sustain a pantry or for when the next snowstorm of the century is a day away and you only have minutes to get TP, bread and milk. \n\nThe bakery here is tops, small selection, but really well made specialities. Huge brownies, iced and moist. They are easily 5 inch squares,  topped with things like Oreo cookies, nuts, sprinkles, and other yummy delights. The best thing I found is the individual pineapple upside-down cakes. Perfect for one person, these are just like the big ones, same buttery cake, same crunchy edges from the brown sugar melting as it bakes, and that almost candied pineapple that has bece one of my favorite desserts of all time.\n\nTry the foccacia dripping with evoo, fresh basil and tomatoes and mozzarella cheese, you'll never buy pizzeria pizza ever again. Take a few home and pop them in the oven and enjoy. \n\nI come here when I need the staples of the pantry like eggs, milk, even a pound of ground beef. The deli isn't the greatest but it will do in a pinch. Good rotisserie chickens too.",251,1
"I was in Vegas with some high school classmates who had never been to the U.S., and they wanted an \""American breakfast.\"" Wanting to get away from the strip and who my visitors a piece of Americana, I Yelped a breakfast place and came up with Mr. Mama's.\n   To begin with that others have said, the servers and managers are all extremely friendly. We were greeted when we entered and wished well on our way out, which made the place inviting and great for us out-of-towners.\n   As a southerner, I ordered my safe but telling biscuits and gravy. The gravy actually had sausage in it, and the biscuits were good, but it was not the most outstanding version I have had. I know that one of my foreign friends ordered the same thing, and he was happy with the experience, which just shows that the dish does not disappoint even those who lack expectations.\n    One of my other friends ordered the California omelet, which looked traditional and delicious. The omelet was made with four eggs, sour cream, and a healthy portion of avocado on top making it a very appealing dish. My friend ate most of it, so I assume that it was not bad.\n   If you decide to go, just know that it serves very traditional but basic American breakfast foods.",273,2
"The casino is ok, but I usually prefer to gamble in the Bellagio. Stayed in a room in the pyramid my first night and the ceiling was incredibly low - felt like I was in a cave. \n\nSecond time, I stayed in a tower room - infinitely nicer, but still not nearly as nice as most other hotels. However, it was on the cheaper side and who really spends that much time in their room when in Vegas? The bed was comfy and that's all that really mattered... past that, I was out gambling. \n\nDidn't get a chance to check out the pool, but it looked nice. \n\nAlso, the club - LAX - not quite my favorite club... overrated & the design was just horrible. Only go if you plan on getting bottle service - otherwise there's no room to dance and you're just surrounded by tables on all sides and if you're 'lucky' you'll see the mind freak...",205,2
"In full disclosure, I have never actually been to the Scottsdale Gun Club.  And after my attempts to contact them, I doubt I ever will.\n\nMy husband went with a buddy before Christmas, and talked about a membership.  The memberships are expensive, and I wasn't sure he was serious about it, so I considered purchasing a gift card online.  I wanted to make sure he could use it for range fees, and not just merchandise, but could never speak with anyone there.  Neither emails nor telephone calls were answered.  When I gave up, my mother decided to try her hand at it as well.  She called two different numbers on their website; no answer at either, and the calls were not returned.\n\nSo maybe this is a great range.  Maybe they have a great store.  But one thing is certain.  Their customer service is non-existent, and my husband's foolish dream of shooting together (as opposed to at each other) and buying me my very own gun are over if it means I ever have to step foot in this place.",227,0
"As your standard restaurant, Atria's has no personality: the food is blah, the service is eh, and nothing is really all that memorable.  The patio and it's proximity to the ball parks are its saving grace.  \n\nNow, let's talk about when we reserved a room for a bridal shower...  We had a fixed menu for a group of about 50 ladies.  I understand that.  But when the bride asks for no tomatoes, you as a server do not say, \""No substitutions!\"" in your meanest voice.  Lighten up, it's her day.  I ended up just taking the tomatoes off for her--and just chalked it up to another maid of honor duty.  The server also kept clearing the bride's drinks while she mingled.  This was annoying, but at least we had paid a flat fee for drinks, so it wasn't the hugest deal.\n\nOverall, the server for the bride's table was just awful and kept treating us like little children.  Yes, the table was the bridal party and the bride's cousins.  Yes, we are all under 30.  But we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event.  The servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers, aunts, great aunts, and grandmothers were polite...even when my near-senile grandmother started yelling about bandits.  Later, another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that, \""he just must be on his period.\""\n\nWhile Atria's is fine for a glass of wine before a Pirate's game if a table is open outside, I certainly would never book it again for a private function.",370,1
"I love the atmosphere.. I wish I wouldve sat at the bar area, it looked pretty cool. Pretty good American food in Vegas to experience while on vacation. The drinks are cool, fun to look at.

Semi overrated.... friends ordered large platters around $15. A $20 order and would give you left overs for tomorrow. Didnt seem like they had as many toping offers as rumour has it. First time for me there so ordered $11 sampler.. should have been $5 it was small and just plane poutine. The cheese wasnt even melted as the gravy wasnt hot enough. Their crushed fries are the good and sweet potatoes. Small glasses of water with super slow and unorganized waiters.ambience was basic and blah. Something to try once and order the full big meal and decide yourself if its worth it. Im not going back.,134,1
"We had dinner as a family. Two people had chimichangas and really enjoyed them. One person had the pork tacos with pineapple and they chowed them down. I had a small bite and they were really good. I ate the chicken enchiladas. I had a choice of red, green or mole sauce. I chose mole. It was a bit sweet. I would try the green next time. The bummer was that they don't give you chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants do. Plus they were very skimpy on the guacamole that came with the chimichanga. Good food and good service. We will be back.",130,3

"The hubs and I stayed here four years ago, back when we could still call ourselves tourists, and The Plaza was a straight up dump.  Twelve seasons and thirty five million dollars later it's more like a butter face girl with a mall department store cosmetic counter make over.  Sure it looks better, but you can still tell under all the frills it's might not be something you want.  There is a strange mix of old and new in here and you can point out right away what has been there for a while.  \n\nI'll start with the old.  Thirty year old chandeliers stick out in a otherwise completely redone elevator vestibule.  Painted doors and hinges that stick in their frames next to poorly placed designer wallpaper.  Tiny bathtubs sit with shiny new faucets and tile.  Light switches and plates stained yellow from decades of smoke pop out from an almost completely renovated room.  There was a threadbare blanket tucked neatly between two new sheets instead of a comforter on the bed.  In the sports book you could walk between the new carpet of the casino that is a gray blend with red flowers to the old green carpet with shapes printed into it.  The buffet is now a sushi place, the layout is pretty much the same, but instead of the buffet line you have the sushi counter, but they kept the silverware.  Even the casino has mix of old barely working poker machines sitting pretty with shiny new reel games with fancy bonuses.  The worst of the old, the parking garage.  It looks like any day it could crumble to bits.\n\nThe new fabulous things are choices.  They have a sushi place, coffee joint, A Hash House a go go, a cupcake stop, Subway, a McDonalds opening soon and of course Oscar's steak house which will be arriving shortly.  There is an Italian place that is so poorly advertised that I can't be sure if it's open yet either.  Another thing that was missing those four years ago; ROOM SERVICE!!!  Yeah, it's probably not that great and is not twenty four hours but it's another choice.  They also house the only bingo joint in downtown.  Check in has moved from the second floor to a small spot right inside the domed area.  It kind of sucks having to walk from the garage all the way through the casino and then back to the tower with luggage in hand.  It would really accommodate someone who is being dropped of by taxi though.  The parking garage isn't in the best of shape, and being downtown, where you can walk anywhere you need to get to, one may not even need to rent a car if you choose to stay here.   \n\nOverall the experience was a good one.  The rooms are still missing a few things like a remote, hair dryer, chairs for the desk and some decorative pillows.  I wish there was a extra pillows or a blanket for the bed as it did get cold overnight.  The room was basically clean and we got a great deal for the night at twenty eight dollars on expedia.com.  I have booked another stay for a friend and I as a girls' night out for a weekend rate of ninety five bucks so you can see there is a big swing in the rates.  I think the best deals are through their own website, but only if you are booking at least a two day stay.  With plenty of dining options and tons to do on Fremont street, the Plaza is a great anchor to spend your vacation checking out the cool side of town.",736,2

"A couple days ago i ordered from daddy's and like normal was confusing. ( i order with two other girls i work with usually) we gave the credit cards over the phone, then when the delivery man was got here (who was very nice) with our food he said he had to swipe our card on his machine, and apologized for the confusion. I got my bill and it seemed really high for just a sandwich. my sandwich was supposedly $7.95 and my bill when he got here was $14.53, seems weird right? well.. i asked him about it , he had no idea so i called the restaurant  to ask, the woman on the phone \""maggie\"" was rude right off the bat, gave me the impression that she was pissed i was calling to see why my meal was so much, she insisted in telling me that she had charged my bill for deliver which she said was $2.50, Okay so i told her that still seems high to me and i said im doing the math right now and i was really over charged, she said \""okay so your good?\"" i said no hold on a sec, she says \"" okay whatever bye\"" and hangs up on me... so lets break down the math\n\nSandwich $7.95\ntax (8.1%) $0.64\nDelivery $2.50 ( mind you we work right across the street) literally\nthe only reason we get delivery is because she wont take our cards if one person goes to pick it up.\n\nso total come to $11.09\n\nso i was right still don't know why it was $14.53... so I call back the restaurant to talk to the manager and explain the situation. Again \""maggie\"" picks up the phone, i asked her if her manager was there and she said no, and says that she can help me, i go on to ask her when is a good time to call back so i can talk to him or her and she continues to insisted on me telling her the problem. First of all, i never said there was a  problem. (guessing she knew who it was) Anyways she is completely and utterly rude to me about not being able to give any kind of information out about him or even what the managers name was. i even asked for an email i can send of some sort. None. so i said thank you i will try calling back another day. about 10 minutes later the delivery man come in with 3 dollars, said that they did over charge me, by $1.50.... uhh ya no  but i was already so tired of this i didn't say anything and he said that he double it for me. I told him thanks and i appreciate it. He continued to apologize for the girl who he said was \""supposedly\"" new. i know shes not i order from them all the time. The service is awful there. Point Blank Period. I would hate to ever give them another dime of my money, since now i know she probably over charges me all the time. Good luck to anyone with a complaint ever getting it fixed. Maggie or whoever the women is there (i don't know if she gave me her real name) get an attitude check. otherwise i will never order there again.",699,0
"Wow, what a great restaurant.  I live in Manhattan, so naturally I never thought I'd be raving about a restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Veg paella was out of this world. Only $10, which wouldn't cover the tip on an equivalent meal in NYC.  Outstanding service (but I came at an off hour). Indoor and outdoor seating were equally popular.  Large selection of vegetarian entrees.  No complaints.",90,4
"If I could give no stars I would. My family placed an order to be picked up and were told to be there at 7:20. We get there and I sit waiting for the food until 8!

Didn't bother going back and moved on to our meals. My honey glazed chicken was average, edible. My husbands sweet and sour chicken was so soggy it was disgusting! Couldn't even eat it.

"Location is the ONLY reason I go to this gym and I've been going to this location and others for the past five years.  This past fall, I had gone to the gym after a few months hiatus.  I was on the treadmill for 30 minutes then went back to my locker.  It was broken into.  My purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or Smart Water.  I guess the robber must have seen what I drove (hint: it's probably an inside job )  There were only 2 staff members on site, both young men-no women on staff (hint: hint: it's probably an inside job then) A police officer did come and I reported the robbery which was the 3rd in two weeks!  The next day, I spoke with the manager.  The same speech he's probably have told others, you can tell the bottom line is the only thing he cares about.  I lost everything plus a $100 bill which was my b-day money and I've spent over a few grand for membership.  I did receive a refund for 3 months but still REALLY!  'Well you shouldn't leave stuff in the locker.  These people go to gym to gym.  We have signs that tell you not to leave items in the lockers\""...ummm it was locked and I've been going here for over four years and have never had an issue until now. If you are having robberies, you NEED to tell people not just a sign!  Plus one of the staff told me they were having major issues this past fall...umm that's not someone from the outside that's a staff member doing the robberies!  I found out last week there were MORE robberies!  So if you are looking for a gym, move on and go somewhere else.  It's not the cleanest gym but I like the sauna and that's about it! And then I get a call that they found my purse and calendar in a locker.  The manager never followed up with me and when I got my items they were sfuffed in a drawer and the staff member didn't even seem to care.  I think it's time for a new staff and management!",469,0
"Since my first review I've been back twice- once for breakfast and once for dinner. For breakfast my bf and I had a local coupon that was $10 a $25 purchase for breakfast, so first off that was a really good deal. We showed up on an early Monday afternoon and there were some people but it wasn't packed (thank God). Our server was great, checking up on us often and in a friendly manner. I ordered the Rosemary Chicken Hash (again) which was wonderful (again), and my bf ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The entire time he was eating he had the greatest look of pleasure on his face, very much a foodgasm.\n\nFor dinner our group of 4 showed up on a Monday night and the place was almost empty, perfect for us. I was very excited to try dinner at Hash House and was not disappointed. My bf had the Chicken and Waffles again as well as his sister, her bf had some sort of bowtie pasta (I can't remember the name but it looked good), and I had the Farmer's Pasta. HH certainly knows how to make innovative and delicious dishes. My dish had chicken over angel hair pasta with corn on the cob, potatoes, barley, and spinach, with all of this sitting in vegetable stock, and griddled parmesan cheese on top. The stock really made everything stay moist and it was delicious. I got full and had some leftovers.\n\nOnly negative about our dinner experience is that our server was in training and it showed. I asked for a Root Beer and got Dr. Pepper instead... kind of hard to fudge something like that up, isn't it? He also poured a can of Guinness into a glass as if he were pouring water, so it was all fizz for quite a while. IMO, all food servers should be required to know how to pour beers properly. Third strike was how inattentive he was; he did not check up on us and we had to flag him down to replace the incorrect soda as well as take a simple request for some pepper. I am glad these were minor infractions and did not ruin our meal nor experience. We did leave him a tip though that implied \""you need to work on some things.\""\n\nEveryone loved their food and had leftovers to take. We also had a coupon that was $25 off a $50 dinner order. Not only is the food delicious and at reasonable prices, but they also offer great coupons in the mail. This is just the cherry on top for Hash House and we are certain to keep coming back.",536,4
"I went here this past weekend to see DJ Icey who spins breakbeats. First, I have to tell you I was really, really excited to see him as I've never gotten to see him live. \n\nHis set was amazing, but there were two main complaints. First, the sound system and secondly, the fact that you couldn't see anything he was doing behind the decks. I really wish Myst would PLEASE realize that those of us who come here to see the DJs don't want to see some tripped out screen saver playing a loop on the only TVs where you can see the DJ spin. This isn't a rave in the middle of the desert, although if it was, I guarantee you it would be a lot cooler. Since they elevated the DJ booth to the second floor (mistake #1) they've had to put screens up so you can see the DJ spin. The other times I've been, the screens have had a constant feed of the decks without stupid visuals playing, which has been great. This time though, I couldn't see shit, just screen savers. I don't like to get pissy about stuff like this, but really, I'm kind of annoyed. When you pay $10 or $15 bucks just to get in, and more on drinks, you really expect top quality production and most importantly, to see the DJ! wtf?! There's only two things I care about when I go out to see any DJ...First, that I can somehow see him/her spin,  that's f*in obvious, and secondly, that the sound is decent. For a venue like this, the sound should be banging. \n\nMyst gets a big fat FAIL for both. The distortion was really obvious this weekend, and probably more noticeable because everything was so bass heavy. I'd think for a club that pulls such amazing talent, which probably rakes in a decent amount of  $dough$ each weekend, they'd spend a good chunk of their budget on getting the sound system up to snuff. Yet, it seems like they've invested thousands into the seizure-inducing lights but a LOT less in any type of sound upgrades. I mean, can we get mother f*in bass bins up in there? It's not a rock concert venue, we don't need more treble, trust me. In fact, the sound was so distorted, I had to cover my ears at one point because they literally felt like they were bleeding. This is a venue for bass-heavy electronic music, and it's a shame when you can't even hear the full range of the music on a gigantic system. It has such potential to be a great venue, minus the lame crowd, because the space is beautiful. I just don't get it. Really, I don't. Each time I go back I'm more and more disappointed.",610,1
"Last time I went to Metro Pizza was a few years ago and didn't blow my skirt up. Coming from back east its hard finding decent pizza here. When you are used to a certain quality its hard to change. Its on par with eating fresh pasta every day and then suddenly only being able to eat Spaghetti O's.\nOn this visit I really enjoyed myself though. I ignored prices (hard to do when they are so high) and went with the Olde New York pie. Really, really, really good. I ended up forcing myself to eat more than I should have because it tasted so good. Not really the NY style that I am used to but it was very good. The server was very nice and the place is clean and well kept.\nThe only negative is the price. Ok so I let myself go this time and put out the $23 and change for a large pie. Will I do it again? Probably not. If I had money to blow I would eat there all the time, so for you rich kids out there go for it!\nAlthough I may go back to try the Mac & Cheese as Matt C seems to love it.",240,3
"Vegan-friendly and GOOD. Enough said. I had a chai latte with almond milk (they also offer rice & soy) and their vegan breakfast burrito.

"I worked at a Best Buy throughout my college career, so I know all about what the employees go through with the upsells, accessories, warranties you name it.  Yes they aren't on commission, but not getting berated by your higher ups is commission enough sometimes.  \n\nI came in the other night because I was eligible for a phone upgrade this week and wanted to check out some of the accessories for the iPhone I had been keeping an eye on.  I told the guy in the wireless department I was just checking out accessories when he said he could put everything together for me and set it aside for the next day.  He entered my phone number into the computer and it turned out I was eligible to upgrade right away!  I already had a case and screen protector, and it turned out if I bundled it with a car charger it was a considerable savings.  He went through the motions on the warranty sales (including the \""buyback\"" program) and was very upfront that this was merely information that he was required to tell me (which I understood), and I in no way did I feel I was being excessively pressured. \n\nWhile the whole transaction took nearly an hour (I had signed up for $50 off through an online promotion they had last month), I was happy to wait since I was sure I'd be stuck with my broke down POS android phone for at least another day.  I was very happy with the experience, and would process my phone upgrade through this Best Buy again in a heartbeat.",317,4

"Quite possibly one of the unprofessional baseball organization I've visited. The announcer didn't know how to pronounce the opponent's player's names, let alone the 51's players names. The concession stands had lines that people were cutting in right in front of ushers, yet nothing was being done. Lines were also slow. Ushers also didn't seem to care if someone was sitting in the seat you paid for. I had someone in my seat and the usher just told me to find another seat. Won't return to watch this team next time I return to Vegas.",123,0
"We went there last night and it empty, service was stretched, food was not very good at all. Naan was frozen mass produced not made in store, Samosa again were frozen mass produced. Water had moldy taste to it and business seems to be struggling to stay open.\n   Lentil soup was ok but really only a few old carrots and I couldn't find a lentil, Salad is useless would rather have had some papadums, with some chutneys. Menu is incredibly limited portions were tiny and prices were high. Naan was rationed out one piece at a time. Waitress was coughing and not covering her mouth, silverware was gritty and all in all 35.00 for two mains and a bowl of rice, just drank the water.\n  It is so sad when I see people keeping places open that should be closed, bring people in and charging more for less does now make for return customers, just makes a funny conversation ride home.

"Let me preface this review by telling you, I'm the biggest Chipotle fan there is.  I visit them whenever and wherever I can.  I love it so much that I've been a long-time (small) shareholder of CMG stock.  So it pains me to say that I'm not sure what the deal is with this Chipotle, but the staff here just seems a bit off compared to other locations.\n\nFirst, nearly every other CMG I've been to around the country takes great pride in cleanliness.  On my last few visits to this one I've had to wipe my own table clean on more than one occasion.  \n\nSecond, they just do not seem well-trained.  My wife made the mistake of ordering a margarita one night and the guy working had to scrounge around for the materials and even ask a co-worker how to make the drink.  Another example, yesterday, my son ordered a cheese quesadilla and the crew basically forgot about it and what resulted was an overcooked crunchy slab of goo.  \n\nLastly, their speed lacks a sense of urgency you find at the other stores.  Again, on yesterday's visit, the guy working who was our first point of contact..you know the guy that grabs the tortillas or bowls based on your order?  Well, he had to change out the bean containers with fresh beans.  This process caused a huge bottleneck because none of his co-workers down the line from him felt the need to jump in and help him either with the beans or with getting us started.  What was a relatively short line of maybe 6 people quickly grew to one reaching the door for no good reason.  \n\n\nI would hope Mr. Ells makes a visit to check-in on this location and somehow rights the ship.  Until I hear different, I'll stay away from this store and go to the one at Power/Ray or Val Vista/Baseline.",416,1
"It would get less than 1 star if possible.  \n\nWhen this branch on Eastern in Henderson first opened they appeared to make an effort to please the local customer base.  We have tried it three or four times.  We have not been here for a couple of months.  \n\nOh my, how fast it has become a has been.  No more tries at this particular site.  \n\nOne order was wrong and the waitress was admittedly 'sorry', enough to offer to 'take care of it' without us asking.  Her idea of taking care of the matter  was to write a note on the ticket \""Wrong omelet, but ate anyways\""... it was half eaten because we were looking for the ham, when we realized it was a mistake we notified the waitress, who did little but write a very rude note and attach it to our check.  \n\nThe other order was served incorrectly also, but- with much delay- corrected.\n\nWe left without finishing half of either meal.  We left a small tip anyways for a small effort.\n\nThe cheery serving staff that was here at the opening has left behind a rather bland, unpleasant staff that is only half interested in making this site as homey as other ones.  \n\nWith so many offerings in the Las Vegas area for breakfast, it would be a better experience to give your business to a nearby alternative, in fact, any nearby alternative.",308,0

"Work at townsquare and was there for lunch and it was a terrible experience.  Let's begin.\n1: Ordered buffalo wings and they were raw, I cut into one with a knife and it started dripping blood.  Manager apologized telling me he wouldn't charge me for the wings that were raw and I didn't eat, like he was doing me a favor. (I sent them back and cancelled the wings all together) \n2: My co-worker ordered a french dip with no onion and they brought one packed with onions but my burger had zero onions.\n3:Other co-worker ordered a salad and didn't come with any dressing at all. \nWe were offered a free dessert for the terrible experience and I asked them to just discount the cost of the dessert from our bill, our waiter was not too happy about that and said \""we are not charging you for the wings already what else would you want us to do?\"" No sh$&t you actually thought I was going to pay for food I didn't eat?  They ended up applying the discount to the bill but it had to be the worst place in townsquare I have ever eaten at.

"Loved it!!!\n\nWe went there last Friday night to be romantic and it definitely did the trick. I had never experienced a BYOB restaurant before and after experiencing it first hand I am hooked. We started the evening with the fillet Mignon tacos and they were fabulous, the perfect start. I had the chicken breast. It was stuffed with goodness and was served with squash, corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. A drizzle of pesto lined the outside of the dish and was the perfect accompaniment. My husband has the salmon as was very impressed (I don't do fish so I can't go into more detail). For dessert we had the four berry tarte, it was warm and the perfect end to a fabulous meal. They serve the type of food that continues to come up in conversation throughout the evening, in a good way.",171,4
"This California Pizza Kitchen, located in the newest shopping center on Las Vegas Blvd S, Towne Center. The service was quick and efficient, the waiter was attentive. The only problems I had with this location was, that my meal felt rushed because the waiter was not only attentive but it seemed like he was trained to \""turnover\"" his tables quickly. I had the Barbeque Chicken Pizza which was good, but they were light on the barbeque sauce. Also I had a Raspberry Mojito that was very watery, and my dessert was just average. Overall, this restaurant has potential if they just slow down.",123,2

"We went last week specifically for the summer signature pancakes.  I know not to expect the real entree to look like the pictures on the menu, but when I received my peaches with raspberry sauce pancakes there were only 2 slices of peaches on top.  My mom and husband both ordered the strawberry and banana ones but one had generous toppings and fillings while the other was very sparse. Hard to believe the dishes made it out of the kitchen looking the way they did and the waitress should have been too embarrased to deliver them.  This is definitely not the first time we've left this restaurant unhappy but this was the most extreme case.   Not to mention the waitress CONSTANTLY said \""awesome\"" while we were ordering.  Not very professional.",151,1

"I've been to two different Burgatory locations, Robinson and the waterfront. I will say the quality is consistent between locations. The food is good and building your own burger is fun, but I don't think it's spectacular to the point that everybody raves about it. \n\nOne great thing is there are a LOT of options when it comes to building your burger. There are a variety of bun types such as brioche, wheat, and gluten fee.  (or you can go naked ;) ). You have an interesting variety of meat options including chicken, bison, beef, elk, crab. The meat variety is impressive.  They also have a variety of rubs, sauces, and cheeses to put on your burger. I definitely have to recommend the spicy ketchup. There are times that I could get Burgatory just for that heavenly spicy ketchup. They also have a variety of standard and more interesting toppings as well. You've got the typical lettuce, tomato, opinions, etc. Then there are the fun toppings (that cost $1 extra) like onion straws, cage free eggs, maple cured ham, and applewood smoked bacon to name a few. \n\nAs far as the burgers go, despite the impressive options, they did not live up to the hype..or price. I was expecting something life changing during my first burgatory experience, and that's not what I got. \n\nI will say that the milkshakes are amazing. Being a milkshake enthusiast, I'll dare to say they have the best milkshakes I've ever had. The big straws are great for drinking up all of the big chunks of delicious goodies they put in your shake! I'm a very big fan of the caramel pretzel shake. A lot of places really screw up Carmel pretzel shakes with an overpowering amount of caramel and almost no pretzels. Burgatory uses a pleasant amount of caramel and throws in some nice BIG chunks of pretzel. The milkshake is the best part of any Burgatory meal. If you don't finish, they put the rest in a to go cup for you. \n\nOther than the milkshakes, I don't find the food to be anything special. It is a very fun atmosphere in the restaurants, though.",471,2

Local discounts are offered so I meet with friends here often. They have a great selection of beer and the nachos are fantastic. The bartenders are friendly and the wait staff is also.

I said, \""there are only 6 adults and 4 children.\"" He (I believe the owner) just shrouded his shoulders and said, \""that's our service charge.\"" $19.25!!!! - that's an extreme charge for servicing water refills and collecting empty dim sum containers.

"Items Selected:\nBlueberry Lemonade\nMocha Frappe\nStrawberry Smoothie\nHoney Toast\n\nLocated in a nondescript strip mall with a simple black and white banner serving as the only indication of its existence suffice it to say that Caf\u00e9 Darak is all the rage with local Yelpers, the Korean-style shop serving up a variety of coffees, teas, frappes, and desserts in a setting conducive to conversation and relaxing amidst shabby-chic furniture, kitsch decor, and even a pop-up canvas Volkswagen bus.  Best described by the term 'precious' with stamp cards hung on the walls and toys delivered with each tray of drinks it was to the sounds of Velvet Underground that we entered the small store and although the only ones placing an order as a few customers lingered to utilize the surprisingly slow Wi-Fi the pace of the service was leisurely at best - three drinks and a dessert necessitating nearly twenty minutes' wait and rousing wonder of what would happen in the case of more business.  Left to rest as Lou Reed rambled overhead when drinks finally arrived expectations were perhaps slightly inflated and although the blueberry lemonade proved both tangy and natural neither the strawberry smoothie nor the mocha frappe were memorable in the least - a subpar blender delivering a crunchy iced experience that could not be sipped through a straw with bland flavors harkening subpar fruits and cheap chocolate sauce, respectively.  Largely unimpressed by the beverages along with the substantial wait it was thankfully in the toast that Darak found a bit of solace as the crunchy bread yielded a pliable center gilded with honey, ice cream, cinnamon and sliced almonds but with the rest of the desserts made elsewhere and the rest of the experience largely lacking I'd be hard pressed to justify a reason to return with two Sambalatte locations serving up a better vibe, larger variety, quality baristas, and a true in-house pastry program without all the twee and time waste.",402,1
"I have never been so angry after eating at a restaurant. This is my first yelp review since 2009 but I had to start with this place, our experience was just awful. \n\nWe arrived at 8:45 WITH a reservation. The place was half empty yet we were sat in a back room on the second floor with two other couples. There was no music and the tvs were off so it was fairly awkward. The rest of the restaurant looked trendy, but this room seemed like just a place to have staff meetings. We asked to be moved to one of the five open two-tops we could see in the main room below but we were told that they were already reserved. Only one had been filled by the time we left at 10:00.  \n\nThe server was completely clueless about anything on the menu which is surprising for a place this expensive ($200 for two people). He was unable to answer basic questions about the food and drink menu. The service in general was terrible, when we left the hostesses just started at us and didn't say a word, and the two valet guys did the same as they watched us try to hail a cab. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best. I ordered the lamb loin chop which was ok but very small, definitely not worth $38. My girlfriend got the prime strip steak which was not good. The menu said that it came with pickled peppers, but a $45 steak that tastes completely like pickles? Are you serious? Also, it came pre-sliced which was a bit of a surprise as well. \n\nThe waiter recommended the tasting menu yet when we ordered the first course a la carte he informed us they were all out. Why would he even suggest something if it wasn't even available? We got the oysters instead which were great, but they were raw; thats more of a testament to the quality of the oysters than to the chef.\n\nOverall the food was terrible and the service was even worse. I would recommend avoiding this place at all costs. $200 down the drain. Definitely will never come back here.",452,0

The restaurant is always clean and the service is good. i like the fact that they have opportunities to support local fire departments.\n\nAt this location the new manager Ryan here gave us excellent customer service.

"Big Guy's is a cool little neighborhood sports bar.  A fun place to catch a game and have a drink with some friends.  The bar was slammed on a Saturday night, which it probably should be considering game 7 of the NBA Eastern Conference finals was on ESPN and Big Guy's hosts Saturday night trivia.  There really is a lot going for this bar, but some little things add up making it fall short of being a great place to go.\n\nFor a sports bar, the beer selection is fairly limited.  There's an awesome selection of bottles, but only six beers on tap.  The beers that are on tap are pretty good (three are four peaks beers, bud light, sam adams, and guinness), but I would expect a sports bar to have a much bigger selection. \n\nThe food is all decent, but still falls short.  My girlfriend and I tried the ultimate nachos with chicken.  The extra $1.75 for a small side of guacamole is a little ridiculous, but that's not my complaint.    What made this dish less than ultimate is the processed cheese that topped the plate.  Wow, that's just wrong.  I know that Velveeta melts better, but for what I paid for this, some real cheddar (or another another cheese) would've been much appreciated.  We also had the chicken sliders.  The pretzel bun, the chipotle mayo, and provolone were good.  The chicken wasn't bad, but could have used seasoning. \n\nThe waitress was as nice as can be and handled a table of more than a dozen people quite well.  She told us that she wasn't allowed to split checks for a group our size (a really dumb policy if you ask me), but ended up doing it anyway.  I don't get why they wouldn't want to split the check.  If we were all one tab, the server would just have to split up 10 credit cards.  Doesn't make much sense.  The tip would probably also be less because we'd stick with the automatic gratuity.\n\nThere are a ton of TV's lining the walls.   We were stuck in the back corner of the bar by the bathrooms, but it was not an uncomfortable spot.  They apparently take reservations, which seems odd for a sports bar, but I guess its nice for people to guarantee they can seat big groups when there's a big game going on.  The menu is pretty extensive for a sports bar, so if we return (which will probably happen soon since we won a $25 gift card playing trivia) maybe I'll find something to eat that I'll fully appreciate.",573,2

They have just about everything - seafood, duck, lamb, plus the standards.  They try to be inventive but usually are not too adventurous - still, the meal satisfies.

"We were looking for a family-friendly place to use a Restaurant.com credit on and chose Pecan Grove.  I have to say it was pretty awful.  The only thing good about it was our server, who stayed on top of things and got our orders correct even though half of the menu was no longer available to order.  The restaurant was dirty, the salad bar way off in a corner in a dimly lit back area of the place and the host made sure to tell us about his history of seizures and that this was the only place he could work because it was close to his home and he can't drive.\n\nI do not recommend anything at all that we ordered, which included mini corn dogs and bacon mac & cheese for the kids, chicken picatta (which was smothered in a greasy sauce and covered in an abundance of capers) and the cordon bleu sandwich (which grossly included honey mustard smeared all over it, making it inedible for my daughter).  But hey, on the bright side, I'm sure these won't be on the menu much longer as they continue their \""overhaul\"" as our server put it.  \n\nBottom line, don't go here.  We were so disgusted by our meals that we didn't even give the pie a chance, but judging from the other reviews, we didn't miss out on anything.",288,1
"Ever have an upscale bratwurst? Well, my friend, are you in for a treat. Pair it up with Wisconsin's staple cocktail, the Old Fashioned and you have yourself a great little bar/restaurant. The decor is super cool as well... I was impressed with the back wall behind the bar with all of the really sweet vintage beer signs and with the comfy leather booths. We were in here with a group for a nice relaxing dinner one night and then again a couple days later for some pre-wedding reception drinking and dice throwing. When you pop in here, you have to try the deep fried cheese curds, they are the best I've ever tasted. Easily one of the best additions to the capital square I've seen in years. Next time I'm back visiting my college town, the rumor is the walley sandwich can contend with the best Louisiana po' boy sandwich any day.",186,4
"Only a fan of the drinks and music, haven't been too happy with the food.  However, for the price, the food is fine.  I'm just really impressed with the music I've seen here and how there is never a cover.  I was skeptical about this place when it first opened, but the staff has changed over for the better and the tap selection has improved as well.  Long live Tempe's actual downtown, the Apache Corridor.",98,3
"Only stayed here for a few hours.  Seriously.  We decided to go to Vegas a night earlier than planned and got there around midnight.  Rooms were big, clean, and great for the price we paid.  There's a monorail stop right outside and we got free shots from the tequila bar downstairs.  We slept well in the comfy beds and would stay again if we needed somewhere cheap and convenient.",86,2
"Ok beer selection. Cook looks like the bride of Frankenstein and never wore a hair net or gloves when making the food. Bar service was awful, no personality and very slow.",36,0

"if you love food, then you'll love this place. END OF STORY!\n\ni came here with a group of friends for a saturday brunch. sure, there was a line and the price was a little high, but i had to try it out after hearing SO much about it. and yelpers, i was beyond satisfied. the food was prepared exquisitely with the finest of ingredients. the dishes were constantly replenished and the selection was ENDLESS. here is just a glimpse of what i consumed during that 2.5 hour meal (only my favorite dishes): scrambled eggs, french toast, smoked gouda cheese + crackers, smoked salmon, cream/tomato based pasta, sushi, sashimi, pad thai, mashed potatoes, fillet of fish, naan.....ok, that's all i can remember but there was a lot more. the desserts were also incredible. the dessert section was a mini bakery/ice-cream shop in and of itself. just so freakin' awesome!\n\nso to some it all up: extravagance. if you're ready to indulge, this is the place for you!",229,4
"I saw Rick Moonen's RM Seafood on Top Chef (Season 6 Restaurant War) and had been looking forward to try this place. We went there for Thanksgiving dinner and had a great time. The restaurant was casual and not too intimidating, the waiters were all very friendly (flirty might be a better word), and the food was sustainable, simple, and delicious. \n\nWe started off with the Butternut Squash Soup with lobster, pumpkin seeds, and pumpkin oil and Rick's White Claim Chowder. The butternut squash soup was to die for, the lobster was so fresh and the pumpkin oil went very well with the soup without making it too heavy. The claim chowder was good but it was a little salty for both of us. \n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, we ordered the Brioch Crusted Baked White Fish and the Wild Cobia & Niman Ranch Pork Belly. The wild Cobia was buttery and flavorful with the pork belly though I think I've had better pork belly. The white fish was very light and delicate. It was very fresh and well seasoned. \n\nFinally, we got to finish everything off with the orange creamsicle with homemade tangerine sorbet, panna cotta jelly at the bottom, and slices of tangerine toped with drizzles of vanilla bean oil. The dessert was quite creative and very refreshing. I would love to have it again. \n\nSo would I go to this place again? I definitely want to try some of the other options on the menu, i.e. Anchor Steam battered Fish n Chips and fried chicken. And I can't wait for the formal dining room to be open upstairs.",352,3
this 1 star is for the service alone!  they wouldnt sit us for some f'ed up reason.  we walked in and were offered inside or out and when we said outside she said well its pretty sunny we said umm ok inside she then said it will be 15 minutes.  mind you there was not one soul indoors.  another 2 ladies walk up and got sat right away!  really?,87,0
"I must go into detail and raise my rating of this hotel. It is absolutely perfect. The staff is perfect and I have had about 10 stays here and it just gets better and better. The Wynn, The Hotel, and the Four Seasons need to come and take note of what true 5 star quality is. You will not be disappointed.",72,4
"I gave one star because it won't allow me to give zero and also the servers tried to be nice...  I went here with my friend and we did the all you can eat.  The first roll we got had crab in it but they didn't say it was deep fried and it was the worst tempura I have ever had, also they put this shredded papery stuff over the roll, Ive never seen that before so idk what it was but it did not enhance the sushi, it made it gross.  I also got an eel and avocado roll and it tasted alright but they drenched it in a sauce that seemed like a watery teriyaki sauce and every grain of rice was literally soaked.  My friend got a spicy tuna roll which she normally loves but this one was like a paste of tuna and tasted so horrible she couldn't eat it.  Also it was suppose to come with eel on top, which they ran out of and didn't tell us. But with the all you can eat, you have to finnish what you order or pay extra for what is left over so she stuffed some into napkins.  It cost us $50 and we both felt sick after.",245,0
"We had high hopes as we headed out to Zappone's for dinner. We are big pizza aficionados. We brought our son, daughter in law and grand baby with us. We both ordered the pizza margarita. We were very disappointed. I give them one star for using fresh buffalo mozzarella, but other than that, it was bland. The sauce had not a lick of flavor. The pizza was almost a liquid, melted mess. It had no flavor at all. The crust was probably ok, but without any flavor in the sauce it tasted like nothing. Each pizza was $18, for cheese pizza. I had hoped with all these 5 stars it would be like Pizza Bianco, but alas, it was not. The waitress was very nice and the establishment was clean. That's about it. Also we ordered the Caesar salad. Again, no real flavor at all. Sorry Zappone's. We really wanted to like you.",194,0
"Went here for some late night eats, and to check out what they had for Vegan offerings.  Spoiler: I wasn't terribly impressed, especially for the prices.\n\nThey DO have a special diets menu (points for that), including separate sections for vegan, nut-free, and gluten-free dishes.  The staff also seemed very well-informed.\n\nWhat WASN'T great wasn't even that they didn't have any real vegan dishes (just pizza and pastas that they left the cheese off of).... it was that the dishes just weren't executed terribly well.  We got the mushroom pizza with truffle oil and penne with chunky tomato sauce.  The pizza crust was great !!! Perfectly cooked and tasty.  The pizza was covered in a mushroom pate of sorts, and was all right, but I didn't really taste any truffle oil.  The pasta was terrible.  Not sure who decided that the very simple tomato sauce should be flavored only with a buttload of marjoram, but that was a pretty bad decision.  Who likes marjoram that much?? Certainly not me, nor either of my dining companions.  And it was a pretty small portion.... thankfully, as I hate wasting food.... for $20.  \n\nThe omnivore of the group had a Caesar salad and pasta with meatballs that he quite enjoyed (apparently they spared the marjoram on that dish).  We also got some pretty good wines (by the glass).  \n\nThe service was great, even though it was quite packed; no complaints there!\n\nSo, if you're vegan and looking to eat at Wynn, all the restaurants have at least one vegan option... and this is probably far from your best option.",368,2
"We ordered delivery from them tonight and we are so disappointed ! \n\nCoconut soup is too creamy,the flavor is there but its texture is too thick for soup.\n\nPad thai noodles were mostly vegetables , and it's kinda bland, and there's baby corns. WHY is there baby corns in my pad thai !!?!? Ugh !!! I would make a wild assumption that their cook is not from Thailand because this is not how an authentic pad thai should taste like. \n\nCurry fried rice was also bland, luckily we have sriracha at home. Again the curry fried rice is not authentic neither.\n\nWe will not order from this place again, sorry.\nFor those of you looking for an authentic or even great taste thai food, this is NOT the place!",166,0
"I went to Wild East today for a quick lunch and was wonderfully surprised by the full flavor of my Szechuan Chicken.  The Sweet and Sour soup was also yummy.  The prices were very, very reasonable.  Can't wait to go back and try the sushi!",58,3
"I visited this place the last time I had gone to Vegas. You can tell that not many people are going to Vegas with the way the economy is. But when I stepped into the restaurant... it was still packed with customers. I will give this place 5 stars for several reasons....#1 they called me the next day to ask how my experience was...I like that. #2 The meal came out to us so quickly, even with all the other large groups sitting around us. #3 The portions were so large that I couldn't even finish the leftovers the next day! #4 The choices are excellent because they offer a few twists on some everyday dishes. Try the truffled mac n' cheese.. to die for! You can also request to have your steak prepared with gorgonzola cheese or Oscar style- with crab meat, asparagus, and bearnaise. Yum! Don't go if you are on a diet.. you'll have plenty to eat when you go! Also don't bring less that $200 if you plan to order steak and drinks....this isn't Outback or Applebees...",232,4
"Probably the worst dining option in the MGM Grand. Went with four friends for a casual lunch, and each one of us were dissatisfied with the service and food. Avoid this place.",37,0
"I wish I could give this place a good review since the food itself is usually good and they have some decent deals.  But the fact is that make far too many mistakes with their orders:  Once they only brought me 25% of my actual order and more than once a driver would forget something, promise to return with the missing item and then abandon me.\n\nBut the main reason Papa John's has lost my business is because the Phoenix Director of Operations, Christina Carter took it upon herself to send me a homophobic email describing gay people as vulgar and stating that I should take my business elsewhere.  Prior to this, I had boycotted Domino's Pizza for years because of the company's antigay attitude but never in my entire life have I ever heard of an employee of a company (much less an upper manager) directly targeting a specific individual customer and telling them \""We don't want your kind here.\""\n\nI notified both the corporate office and this store of Ms. Carter's actions and neither place could even be bothered to do so much as to issue a minimal apology, implying that the company itself fully condones, supports, and encourages Ms. Carter's reprehensible actions.  If you give Papa John's your business, just be aware your pizza will be topped with hatred and bigotry.",276,0
"The ladies were very nice and caring to my two cats, but I will not be going back here.  The prices are unbelievable!!  I called to ask about an ultrasound for my pregnant dog and told the girl on the phone she is at 35 days( too early for an x ray).  She said they don't do ultrasounds and that she would make an appt for an x ray.  When I asked the price, she said $300 plus a visitation fee.  I called the vet down the street from me that's within walking distance and they said they would need a $40 visitation fee and that the x ray would be $120 at the max- most likely only $60 for one frame. Talk about taking advantage of loving animal owners and charging more than double what it should be.  I called one more vet just to reference, and they too said $60 for an x ray.    \nWhen I took my cat in for her de claw,  they tried to throw in an extra $200 worth of tests and services that were unnecessary.... All they want to do is sell you a bunch of crap... And they do not care about your pet-- they only care about your wallet and how big of a hole they can burn in it.  By the way,  those photos that are uploaded on yelp are laughable...",288,0
I hate leaving bad reviews but this one deserves it. I spat out half my choices. They even managed to stuff up the ice cream. I'm not a fussy eater at all but this place is bad. Tough n chewy covered in sauce to make it edible.,55,0
"I desperately wish I could give this beautiful lakeside spot my highest rating but unfortunately our dinner there last night left much to be desired. Although we were seated almost immediately after arriving (a big plus in my ravenous state), there were no specials to choose from & we weren't given any recommendations for cocktails even though I, for one, was definitely interested. I ended up ordering a white wine I'd never heard of because, surprisingly, there was no chardonnay on the drinks menu. I thought a white would pair well with oysters on the half shell which it did but I was never even offered a second glass, even after wolving down the oysters (which were delicious). Anyway our main courses of salmon and lamb met with mixed reviews. My fiance said the salmon was fantastic (I did have a small taste & it was admittedly good), however the lamb was nearly impossible to cut; it was so bone-ridden & veiny. I actually had to have it recooked beyond the degree I would normally want it cooked just so that I could attempt to cut it. I'm not sure what the problem was but for starters it was nearly all bone and precious little meat. I dare say unacceptably small proportions for a $28 dish. To boot, I got my dish back just as my partner was finishing his meal so it felt like we barely even dined together (you know how it goes with oysters, they are gone in 2 minutes flat). For desert we ordered my favorite, creme brulee. We also ordered expressos (decaf since it was already very late). Years ago I studied & worked in France for a total of five years so believe me when I say I do know my creme brulee! Although this one was unarguably delicious, I would think for a restaurant of this caliber they would know that the carmelized top should be much, much thinner than it was. Suffice it to say that you shouldn't need more than a whisper of a tap of your spoon to crack it, not a sledgehammer. But it was delicious nonetheless. Just not 100% authentic which I would have expected at a restaurant of this caliber. All in all, I left on the hungry side, altogether far too sober side (neither of us were offered seconds, even my big burly boyfriend) and the bill was still $120 (with tip). Ouch. Definitely pricey for the amount of food. I do love & appreciate that we have a fine French restaurant in Madison, however Sardine needs to step up their game. At least my Westie is happy with the two little lamb chop bones he got to enjoy today!",545,2
"Me likey!!  Let's be honest...I think the real reason I liked this place is because it felt like I was walking into my grandma's kitchen.  She is old school italian and has some of the same creepy black and white photos of random Italian families hanging on her walls...And her house has the aroma of garlic 24-7.  :)\n\nNo, seriously...I was impressed with Zio.  I don't eat Italian out very often because I prefer homemade sauce and pasta.  I am an Italian food snob because I come from an italian family...sorry, just being honest.  But, Zio was pretty decent.  \n\nI liked the atmosphere...as I described earlier..I expected grandma to walk out of the kitchen at any moment.  It is a low key, casual environment...which is great.\n\nI went with the basic angel hair and meat sauce with meatballs dish.  It was very good.  The sauce was a little tangy and maybe slightly too salty for my taste but it was good and homemade so I can't complain.  The meatball was very good as well.  It was also homemade and had a lot of flavor.  My dining partners tried the Penne Vodka and the Salmon Piccata and they were very impressed.  The vodka sauce was a little runny but it still had great flavor and a ton of fresh cut garlic so that was awesome. \n\nThe bread they serve with your meal was very good but I will say the herb infused olive oil was a bit bland.  We had to add salt and pepper so it didn't just taste like vegetable oil.  I am questioning if they ran out of olive oil and just served us something else.  Not sure...\n\nI hear the pizza is the way to go with Zio and I will definitely be back so that will be the next thing I try.  But, overall, I think it is a good, down-home, authenticish Italian restaurant here in Charlotte.",427,3
The first thing I noticed while walking upstairs was that the banister was sticky and filthy . next the fire alarm went off numerous times and the games shut off. management never announced what was happening and approximately how long the situation would last. You would have thought that they would take this opportunity to wipe down the machines and vacuum the carpet. You would be wrong.The service is poor. As I am writing this we have been sitting on the patio for over 45 minutes with no one coming out to ask if we would like something.  The tables outside haven't been cleaned either. The bar wasn't any better. Customers had to clean up from previous patrons. Not sure if they were just having a bad night or if this is the norm.,154,0

"Where do I start?  They closed poker to focus on stealing from their guests.  They have charged our credit card now for over 4000 total and for \""damages\"" to the room. We did break one lamp but they took it upon themselves to go shopping with our card and remodel their piece of u know what rooms.  It's so ran down that I'd rather a motel six.  That's why they closed down poker and the rain.  This place should be demolished.  After two days of calling and promised returned calls, not one person can explain why my card is getting nailed.  Lowsy staff also.  Only one person in that place is awesome.  Her name is Stacy and she is actually a room service manager.  If you ever read this Stacy, get the hell out if that hell hole and go somewhere classy because you have class.  Everyone else just keep working at the palms and u can go down with it",201,0
"I ordered the Titanesque, and it was true to its name! Gigantic platter with poached eggs, toast, sausages, ham, baked beans, French toast (pain dor\u00e9), bacon, roasted potatoes, delicious but impossible to finish.

"I've been to Mundo twice now, and highly recommend it.  It is a bit pricey, but well worth it.  The service this time was not great, but the food was fantastic.  I had the sea bass, which was amazing.  It came with vegetables and was quite spicy, which I like.  When it arrived it was still wrapped in the paper pouch in which it was cooked, so that was a bit of a mess.  I get it...  It keeps it warm and tastes very fresh when you open it yourself.  But then I had this big piece of soggy parchment on my plate.  I had to ask a waiter to take it away.  Otherwise, the flavor and texture were superb.  Despite the messiness, it's a dish well worth ordering.",166,3
"Good place, friendly service, free wifi with tables and chairs to hang out for a while.  The staff welcomes you when you walk in and when you come to the counter the greeting is even more welcoming.\n\nIts Starbucks so the drinks are pretty much the same as any other, however, the music selection here is good and the atmosphere is warming enough to make you want to hang out for a while.\n\nThey get a good crowd that flows through here every day and they allow you to hang as long as you like.  Its nice to have a place to go hang out in for a bit and have anything from just a cup of water to a coffee drink.\n\nMy son-in-law comes through here just about every morning and he has NEVER complained about the drive through or the service, so this place has to have an amazing group of managers with an amazing work environment and stafff.\n\nI can say that my experience here, I see a friendly staff who all get along with each other, they take a lot of pride in their work and the environment is one of a place one would enjoy working.",235,3
"Came here with my family for my mothers birthday and it was very delicious. I love how their portions are made for sharing family style. Prices are reasonable and service was great.

"Definitely stop by Tix4Tonight to get the 50% off (certain) entrees. Yes, there's a separate menu for this but it's still quite a good selection and includes their best stuff (so it's not a downgraded menu). I don't feel that we were treated any different at the restaurant for having that voucher. But I do think the reservation times are limited if you get it, T4T will make the reservations for you when you purchase the vouchers.\n\nIf you are seated by the window, it's a nice view.\n\nService is good. We had Moon our first visit and he was great. He was extremely nice and even offered to and packed our leftover bread for us (some waiters look down upon that and would rather throw it away- I don't like to waste food). Second visit, we had an older man who was also quite nice.\n\nThe food is excellent. We have to get the escargot, it's delicious. We've also had the lobster bisque and that's good too. Going forward, I will always order the prime rib. First trip, I had the surf and turf which was fine and my BF ordered the prime rib. They gave him a huge, and I mean HUGE portion. He usually prefers steak over prime rib but after reading the yelp reviews, he went with the recommended prime rib and was not disappointed. He thought it was really good and even went as far to say it's comparable if not better than Lawry's. So on our next trip, I got the prime rib and he tried the chilean sea bass. Of course, the prime rib was delicious and he thought the chilean sea bass was too. We had leftovers and heated up the prime rib in the microwave at the Signature the next day, and it still tasted delicious even after being re-heated in the microwave.\n\nI think they have a pretty good wine selection (don't really remember exactly). I just remember that we got a bottle of wine that we enjoyed (Titus Zinfandel) so we were happy.\n\nSo... Excellent value with the 50% off vouchers, good food, and good service, I'm definitely coming back.",472,4
"As a local couple in Las Vegas we like to try different upscale restaurants throughout the city.  My husband is a serious \""foodie\"", a great cook and I am one of the pickiest eaters anyone would ever meet.  We tried the steak house at Arizona Charlies on Decatur last night and have to say I was very disappointed.  It started off good but went down hill fast.  First we were seated in the back, by the kitchen even though the entire restaurant was empty except maybe five tables.  We overlooked that.  We were attended to quickly by a very nice and informative waiter who gave very good advice on what to order and drink.  The Chef salad he prepared in front of us was amazing and for me to say that since I generally don't eat Chef salad is definetely saying something.  He recommended an amazing red wine and great steak for my husband and the sword fish for me as well as a drink.  The food was good but the sauce over the swordfish reminded me of the sauce in chicken pot pies so I scraped it off.  At this point we had decided he was going to be tipped VERY well but then.....we looked at our completed plates for 20 minutes with not one bus boy to clear the table and no attention by the waiter even though he walked by us at least ten times and kissed the butts of the patrons seated in the next booth.  By the context of their conversation they ate there weekly and were well known.  They consumed all of his attention which I am assuming because they are weekly clients and great tippers.  What he doesn't know is that when we find a local restaurant we are also great tippers and will visit often and refer people. We eventually asked the bus boy for our check and at that point he took some of the plates from our table.   So what could have been one of our new local steak houses will not be visited by us again which is too bad because the food was good.  \n\nTina Highberger",413,2

"When dining out, I am a big fan of steak, and great service...Fleming's offers plenty of both.  \n\nHaving dined at Fleming's on more than one occasion, I can confidently say that they know how to cook a steak to your requested temperature.  At these prices, this should go without saying, but plenty of chophouses still don't meet this criteria.\n\nAll side dishes are a la carte, and on the large side, so I'd recommend sharing.  The potatoes and vegetables are always great dishes.\n\nMixed drinks are poured well, and not priced too crazy, relative to the entrees.  My staple, a Jack & Coke, was $7.50...I've paid more.  The wine list is extensive if you so choose.\n\nService was excellent, if a bit methodical...could be a bit more personal.\n\nFour stars instead of five, because everything is just done well...nothing stands out as above and beyond, especially at this price point.",222,3
This place was pretty good. We got two dinners take out and the food was cooked well and completely. It was not too salty.

"We had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Gault this past weekend. The hotel itself is beautiful and meticulously clean in a great location (close enough to everything while still being quiet). We were lucky enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to an apartment room which greatly exceeded our expectations-- while minimalist in decoration, the room was both cozy and luxurious. The staff was also outstanding, offering friendly greetings and opening doors for us each time we passed through the lobby. Our rooms were promptly cleaned each morning, and the turn down service (with surprise champagne and treats the first night, as well as water bottles) was a treat after a long day of exploring the city. We were also pleasantly surprised to find that the valet had left cold water bottles in the car for our trip home! Overall, I can't rave enough about this hotel which made for the most perfect, relaxing long weekend in Montreal. Hope to return soon!",185,4
