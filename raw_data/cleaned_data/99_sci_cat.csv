Brains can be very different, yet overall I think understanding the organized communal side of human beings and why it’s important to care for life brings us to the logical side of the argument. \n\nHowever I wonder if we can say it’s causal from a natural argument. Meaning does a high IQ in its self, derived from predisposed natural genes end in higher IQ, or is it the nurture and or education of understanding that comes into play? Do populations with high IQs have stronger empathy as a learned and adhered to cultures standards? Usually you could ask many more clarifying questions to dig what resembles causality out of it. \n\nI feel like either way we’re barreling down some potential uncomfortable rapids here in a wooden keg, just by asking the questions.",186,Biology

Only states that have been observes so far are colourless ones, as far as I know, but the search is still ongoing.\n\nThe colour charge is a property of a symmetry group: SU(3) Weyl group, I believe. So you can swap the ""colour label"" between particles/quarks and the system is invariant. This is the essence of symmetry.\n\nEdit:\nI took a quick glimpse at the QCD Lagrangian, and I think that two quarks with equal colour state experience a different interaction than two quarks with different colours.

Radioactive decay produces far more energy than required to break a bond. So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here. In the real world, no-one wants heavy metal chemistry, because the 92 more stable elements can do so much, are safer to use, and much much cheaper.

"I am increasingly interested in the prospect of going after a PhD in Switzerland or Germany. For the record, I have a M.S. in chemistry and the idea of a shorter PhD sounds appealing to me, especially given that I just entered my 30s. I look at various places and wonder how hard it would be to make this happen. For the record, I am interested in Eth Zurich, schools in Germany and the UK, and am passionate about organic chemistry and multi-step synthesis. I have been in industry for a few years after obtaining my master's, however I have no publications, at least, the material may not be published for a few more years (my former advisor is slow to publish and has a record of taking 5 years after graduation to publish a work). I am curious if anyone has ever made that leap from the States to Europeans schools. I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.
  \n
  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment? Should I just reach out to random graduate students/advisors and ask them about their research or does it just seem like such a pie-in the sky question to ask that a graduate student or advisor may even chuckle at my inquiry?",397,Chemistry

"As a chemistry the advice I always give in my office hours is to solve equation based problems in the reverse of how the solutions are shown in class.\n\nStart by figuring out what the question is asking for as the answer. Then start solving from an equation that has that value in it. (Early on in chemistry there will be only one or two equations that you know with the target variable, so it's a safe starting point) \n\nNext go stepwise through that equation and for each variable see if it's given to you directly by the problem. \n\nFor the remaining variables not given directly in the problem, find another equation that has that variable in it, and substitute that into the original equation.\n\nthen repeat going step twice through that new addition equation identifying which variables are given to you in the problem. Repeat for all unknown variables. If you sub in an equation and pretty much everything in it is not given to the problem try a different equation.\n\nI recommend not putting any numbers in until the very end. Keep the whole thing as an alphabet soup. You'll get lots of partial credit that way even if you mess up. Then for the very last step, show each number that you sub in and solve for the value of the variable the problem is asking for.

They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2. In which case they may assume that the power is produced externally (nuclear or renewable) and that this is a way to mitigate CO2\nproduction which would happen anyway.

"Here’s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n““>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\n\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",1599,Physics

It’s especially pronounced in gasses and fluids since their molecules aren’t stuck together like solids.\n\nWe can express this as the ideal gas law\n\n(Pressure) x (Volume of container) = (amount of gas) x (Conversion ratio) x (Temperature). \n\nSince the amount of air isn’t changing, and the volume of container isn’t either, change to temperature has a directly proportional effect on the pressure of the bottle.\n\nEventually the pressure overcomes the weight of the lid, and latch.\n\nIt then equalizes pressure, gas leaves the system, and the lid falls, closing.\n\nActually similar to how the coolant in your car engine gets distributed. There is a flow regulator they call a thermostat that as it gets warmer it expands and lets through more coolant starting at some designated temp. If it gets cool it provides less coolant. It’s a self regulating system, and how your car engine always stays at the same temp once it’s heated up.",239,Physics

"Any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility / infectivity. Not because of any ""want"", natural selection doesn't require desires. Most viruses have relatively high mutation rates, and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication, some may improve transmission. Thanks to high replication rates in hosts (ofther factors being equal), any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral population.\n\nUntil recent decades, it was believed that viruses were under selection for *less* virulence (which FYI, means ""disease severity or lethality""), because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect. For example the 1918 H1N1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts, with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day. This actually hindered its spread, as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease. It perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of H1N1 are far less virulent.\n\nHowever, there are some important exceptions. If a virus is normally transmitted in a pre-symptomatic stage of infection, there will be little selection for less virulence. For transmission, it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with others.\n\nAnd if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence, then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence. For example, the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein for host ACE receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose / inoculum (thus increasing  transmissibility), as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts, plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response. The Delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type, and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups. Here, its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence.",425,Biology

"$100 per tonne would be reasonable in terms of the cost of a carbon credit (denominated in 1t). Not absurdly cheap, but apparently below the figure used for planning by some major companies, so this could be economically viable. \n\nThe problem is where the energy comes from. There are three possible answers that I can think of: \n\n1. They have just ignored this problem. Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2. In which case they may assume that the power is produced externally (nuclear or renewable) and that this is a way to mitigate CO2\nproduction which would happen anyway. In this case there is no need for the power budget to match.",257,Physics

Again since it's dependent on concentration, if you have a really concentrated amount of acid, it can easily go negative. \n\nYou can also use an online pH calculator like this one [https://sensorex.com/ph-calculator/](https://sensorex.com/ph-calculator/). \n\nThe damage depends not just on pH but also the exposure site (eyes), duration, thoroughness of washing, the type of chemical etc. So using pH alone to tell how much damage was done is a bit meaningless.

"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills.

"See [here (especially citations 10–12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion#Axion_dark_matter) and [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion#Cosmological_implications) They are their own antiparticle, so when their field ripples, two of them get made at once (instead of a particle-antiparticle pair). During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.",325,Physics

"I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others. It's much like that episode in friends when Phoebe let's a bee sting her. I hope that attempts to answer your question.",459,Biology

"It’s complicated, but the speed of light is a fundamental property of spacetime. If you look at Maxwell’s equations on electromagnetism, c is derived directly from the electrical and magnetic properties of a vacuum. \n\nIt was Einstein that realized that c is always the same in any reference frame - that’s special relativity. From general relativity, we can calculate motion through spacetime and we know that particles with mass can only get close to c, but never actually get to c. \n\nWe also know that general relativity is not perfect. For example, it doesn’t work at the singularity at the center of a black hole. We also believe there is a link between general relativity and quantum field theory, but we haven’t found it yet. \n\nThere’s still lots of things to discover. There are unknown physics out there.

"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what’s actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it’s velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we’re not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket’s increasing power given by F x V.",263,Physics

"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes. The lists of ""health hazards"" is practically limitless. But ""hazard"" is a sliding scale. You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",641,Chemistry

"$100 per tonne would be reasonable in terms of the cost of a carbon credit (denominated in 1t). Not absurdly cheap, but apparently below the figure used for planning by some major companies, so this could be economically viable. \n\nThe problem is where the energy comes from. There are three possible answers that I can think of: \n\n1. They have just ignored this problem. Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2. In which case they may assume that the power is produced externally (nuclear or renewable) and that this is a way to mitigate CO2\nproduction which would happen anyway. In this case there is no need for the power budget to match.",257,Physics

"> using vinegar to clean greasy ovens and microwaves\n\nIt's a mild cleaning option.  Perfect for some uses - too slow for others.\n\nThe grease in your oven is mostly food oils.  So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.  Because it's neutral and almost hydrophobic, that allows it to penetrate through the grease to the substrate and then start to swell the grease layer from underneath.  Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.

"> You don't need to be skeptical. \n\nSkepticism is the heart of science.\n\nThe issue here is that there's no opportunity to build pressure. As soon as the pressure on the lid exerts a force slightly greater than the weight of the lid, the lid moves and the pressure is lost. Thus we would not expect the lid to move very much, regardless of the weight.\n\nThe proffered explanation relied on a lid which was both heavy enough to build up pressure to move the lid dramatically, and light enough to be moved dramatically. That's a problem for the explanation; skepticism is warranted.\n\nOthers have suggested a sticky-lid mechanism, which seems likely to adequately explain this.

Well water itself is made of 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen and gases can dissolve in water as well. Look at soda drinks it has co2 in it.

"For me, biology was a lot of memorization in the first 5 classes or so, and chemistry was much more “learn a set of skills” and problem solve with them.\n\nNot sure why some people are telling you chemistry isn’t.  If you genuinely like and are good at chemistry, you memorize a few things and then problem solve the rest.  Look into organic chemistry.  It’s very puzzle-like.  I took like 70 hours of chemistry as an undergrad- it’s far more applied than memorization.\n\nGranted, I’m now transitioning over to computational chemistry after doing an organic chemistry PhD and 4 years of medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, so take that with whatever grain of salt you want.\n\nThe one thing I’ll say is that unlike in school, where you’re applying known things to answer questions, chemistry bench research is far slower.  It’s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it’s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it’s not working to figuring out why it’s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there’s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn’t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.  This is not true in chemistry research.\n\nHowever, in undergrad, it is if you understand chemistry.

">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",562,Physics

"Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor or researcher, and I haven't read anything about ibuprofen vs. COVID vaccines, but I'll take a stab at it:\n\nInflammation (aches, soreness) is part of the human body's immune response to infection or vaccines. Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory, and thus might work to lessen the inflammation triggered by the vaccine (maybe, I dunno for sure).\n\nIbuprofen wears off fairly quick, so any anti-inflammatory action should be short-lived. Ideally. But taking more ibuprofen is something to be wary of. \n\nDid you completely negate the vaccine with one dose of ibuprofen? Unlikely (but I don't know for sure). The immune response consists of more than just inflammation (white blood cell recruitment, memory-cell generation) that takes a while to generate maximum protection (two weeks for full effect). My **guess** is taking ibuprofen for one out of fourteen days wouldn't make much difference. \n\nIf someone wants to correct me, and/or link to studies of vaccines and ibuprofen, please feel free.",233,Biology

Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration). If you don‘t understand these things you won‘t really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once you‘ve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry. They are very basic principles and maybe not the most interesting but as you learn more you will notice that you will encounter them quite often. And from there just see what you‘re interested in and go for that.\n\nI guess organic chemistry might be a good start to understand some stuff that happens in nature and you can go into biochemistry from there if that seems interesting to you. \nJust be aware that if you want to check out organic chemistry depending on where you learn it from there might be a ton of reactions that are nice and cool but only relevant for synthesis and not for the sort of understanding you seem to be interested in.\n\nGenerally there are some good videos starting from the very basics on youtube if that‘s something you like.",336,Chemistry

"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",325,Physics

"IMO-->  Empathy is a multi-faceted problem.  I would relate it to the kind of computational power required to simulate our universe, with all of it's constantly changing and simultaneously interacting variables.  The more accurately you can create someone else's world in your mind, the deeper your empathetic understanding will be.  It would also require simulating any emotional feelings, separate from standard inputs like sight, sound, touch, taste, temperature, etc.  All environmental variables would need to be simultaneously processed, respective to their constant changes.  Empathy requires the kind of math quantum computers were built for.  Most of the same kinds of mental skills would be required when imagining a complex mechanical device in action, with all of it's moving parts, friction heat, outside influences, and any other variables.  For the same reasons it would also apply to complex chemical reactions or visualizing complex physics.  Or you can imagine choosing the most efficient route for a package in a large shipping company, with all of it's ever moving planes, trains, trucks, personnel, etc.  The variables are constantly changing, therefore, the package's route is ever changing.\nThis would be different, however, than someone who memorized fixed mathematical rules to solve a complex linear or singular type equation.  Therefore, if a multi-faceted intelligence is valued over a more focused linear type intelligence, then yes, it would require more intelligence to produce higher quality empathetic understandings.

"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",357,Physics

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",866,Physics

"Ok so I'll just regurgitate what I know. Plasmogamy = Fusion of protoplasm/the plasma walls. Syngamy = Fusion of gametes. Karyogamy = Fusion of nuclei. In paramecium two (iirc) haploid micro-nuclei get exchanged and then the paramecium detach from one another, then the nuclei fuse. In that instance the fusion of the paramecium would be Plasmogamy, then, later, when they detach and the nuclei fuse that would be Karyogamy.\n\nUsually Karyogamy follows after the plasmogamy. In some instances though, like some Basidiomycota Plasmogamy and Karyogamy happen at vastly different times. First the Hypha of two individuals fuse when they meet, and then, when the conditions are right the nuclei fuse and the mushrooms form their fruiting bodies to expel their spores.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I'm not very knowledgable about Myxomycota however (or slime molds) and would recommend checking out the subreddit for that, as it does exist and the people there are very much willing to answer those questions.

Does the mass of the car matter for the velocity, or is it like simple falling object that depends only on the gravitational constant?

"I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nIt's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution.

Get a pHD if you want to be treated well and afford rent. Bachelors level chemists are typically treated like grunts and get paid garbage for their first several years after college.

"As someone else mentioned, yeah, it's the weak interaction that's weird in this way, not neutrinos. And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",279,Physics

"Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework?  For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms or molecules not particles.  You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.

"What I'm trying to tell you, in like the nicest way possible, there isn't very much chemistry of heavy elements, because their radioactivity and short lifespan makes forming bonds very difficult.\n\nI'd still take chem and pay attention in inorganic classes, we had a module on lanthanide and actinide chemistry.\n\nHowever there's much more study in physics of the properties of super heavy elements.\n\nThe TLDR is super heavy elements don't exist long enough to do any meaningful chemistry, and it's likely not going to be the ""next big thing""\n\nGo where your heart is, take chemistry for chemistry's sake, or take physics because you like radioactivity and the other physics that goes along with it.\n\nFrom another perspective, think about how much energy is in a radioactive decay, then think about how much energy is needed to break a bond. Radioactive decay produces far more energy than required to break a bond. So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here. In the real world, no-one wants heavy metal chemistry, because the 92 more stable elements can do so much, are safer to use, and much much cheaper. And also, they exist on a meaningful timescale.",306,Chemistry

"It’s unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn’t even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth’s temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I’m not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren’t able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn’t have replaced oil. It also wasn’t merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don’t make a compelling case for why we shouldn’t try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",548,Physics

"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",357,Physics

"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today — these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics — or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people — humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension — are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.

I think that having your issue more fleshed out helped.\n\nI completely agree that switching emery production away from fossil fuels to renewables is the most important thing that needs to be done. Without it, carbon capture feels pretty pointless. I think that it’s still worthwhile to research and develop carbon capture though because should we manage to switch away from fossil fuels, there’s still a lot of CO2 currently in the atmosphere that we could remove to reverse warming. \n\nOne other thing to mention is related to my other comment in this thread: small molecule adsorbing materials (CO2 adsorbing materials being one of them) have a lot of potential for filtering pollutants out of gas and water, and it’s probably a good thing for carbon capture to get attention and likely in the process help more research and funding go to understanding and developing such materials.",189,Physics

"What even is intelligence? I feel like it's very ill-defined because it's hard to quantify. There are multiple types of intelligence and within those types there are subtypes. Is general intelligence simply the average of one's different types of intelligence? I feel like intelligence may be impossible to quantify with the limited information that we can gather about someone. For example, Nickola Tesla was an ""intelligent"" individual but he was also delusional and had problems forming relationships which suggests that he had a low emotional intelligence. Therefore I would say Tesla was in fact of average intelligence, even though he was a very noteworthy individual who advanced various fields of science. Perhaps intelligence can be defined by one's contributions to society, but even that leaves a lot to be desired. Can anyone recommend a book about what intelligence actually is?

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",866,Physics

"Agreed on false equivalence; I am not advocating MOND, or suggesting that it's a superior alternative to fit observational evidence -  we indeed have sufficient models for this. What I am suggesting however is that the largest technical breakthroughs in a theory tend to be ""hacks"" in the sense that, without a broader framework, they stitch together potentially disparate mathematical techniques in order to parsimoniously explain observations. This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe. This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it.

"The velocity at the outlet is derived [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli%27s_law#Derivation). In the last line of the derivation, they assume the pressures outside the tank and at the top of the fluid column are both atmospheric, but that's not the case here. So what you want is the second-to-last equation, which contains both the contributions from the height of the tank, and from the pressure difference.\n\nAnd you can see how that varies as you change the position of the hole in the tank. If the pressure difference between inside and outside is dominant, then moving the hole up or down will have little effect on the flow velocity, and the velocity will be proportional to the square root of the pressure difference.",164,Physics

They are both singlet states of the weak interaction and both are observable only indirectly, so it is very difficult to say.

"I am increasingly interested in the prospect of going after a PhD in Switzerland or Germany. For the record, I have a M.S. in chemistry and the idea of a shorter PhD sounds appealing to me, especially given that I just entered my 30s. I look at various places and wonder how hard it would be to make this happen. For the record, I am interested in Eth Zurich, schools in Germany and the UK, and am passionate about organic chemistry and multi-step synthesis. I have been in industry for a few years after obtaining my master's, however I have no publications, at least, the material may not be published for a few more years (my former advisor is slow to publish and has a record of taking 5 years after graduation to publish a work). I am curious if anyone has ever made that leap from the States to Europeans schools. I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.
  \n
  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment? Should I just reach out to random graduate students/advisors and ask them about their research or does it just seem like such a pie-in the sky question to ask that a graduate student or advisor may even chuckle at my inquiry?",397,Chemistry

Giving testosterone (T) as part of transgender transition from female to male is *very* different from giving T to adult cis males to alter voice. \n\nThe first one raises T from very low (female normal) to high (male normal), similarly to the change in puberty, while the second would be a much smaller increase (if at safe levels). So, the proper comparison with trying to lower voices of cis male adults with more T would be trying to *further* lower voices of trans men *after* their transition -- something known not to either work or be safe.\n\nGiving a large T increase to adult cis males to lower voices might work (I don't know but doubt it), but would definitely carry important long-term health risks including high cardiovascular health risks, blood pressure increase, certain types of feminization (as the body tries to rebalance by increasing estrogen), testicular atrophy and more.\n\nEdit: typos",211,Biology

"60 applications with 2 interviews is a very low success rate. There may be something systematic on your end that you're doing/not doing over your qualifications. A good CV and cover letter is an art, ideally you tailor each one to the job you are applying for.\n\nHiring managers can easily filter people out by who's paid attention when sending out CVs, the less generic the better, it's all about being memorable.\n\nMy advice, pick about 8 jobs you actually like, not just ""I'm applying because I need a job and have skills in chem"". Put the time and effort in to rewrite your CV, making sure to include key words listed on the job posting. Make sure to emphasise (key skill they are looking for) from X experience under the relevant experience. So before they call you to interview they don't have to spend any time thinking about whether your experience is relevant. Assume that the hiring manager is overworked. When you are done, you have EXACTLY 1 MINUTE to read your CV and decide whether you are a good candidate for the role. Best thing you can do is give the selection criteria to a friend and time how quickly they can tick off the key things the hiring people are looking for. (This is a true anecdote from a friend who does hiring for their company). \n\nMost people will filter you out at selection if you don't meet their entry criteria. If the general talent pool is applying with a master's or PhD, then you're probably not qualified for the role (not always the case, you can be overqualified too, some people don't want to hire a PhD when they could train a BSC to do the job for 5-10k less per year.\n\nEdit, sorry for formatting, mobile",377,Chemistry

"It's not a stupid question, just perhaps an uncomfortable one to consider.\n\nThe answer boils down to ""yes, but..."". Just as we have bred various animals for specific tasks, we could hypothetically breed ourselves for increased strength and durability, or for some other goal. If we can turn wild steppe horses into massive Clydesdales and speedy Arabians, or take grey wolves and turn them into mastiffs and chihuahuas, we can certainly do similar things to ourselves.\n\nThe thing is, though, such changes come with trade-offs. A growing body only has so many resources at its disposal, and sinking those resources into one organ or function takes them away from somewhere else. We humans dump a lot of resources into our huge brains, for example, at the cost of a lot of other things compared to other animals; it's just that our brains provide such a massive advantage that it's worth it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: I think it's in the final episode, but at some point Nolan tells Mark that Viltrumite genetics are so pure that Mark's basically fully-Viltrumite; Mark only inherited a few superficial genes from his human mother. That's not how things work; to a biologist, ""genetically pure"" actually means ""*super* inbred"". \n\nA lot of domestic animal breeds have health problems, especially pure-breds. Not only are pure-breds usually very inbred, but if they've been bred for specific purposes, they tend to be very good at that but worse at other things. If we started breeding humans specifically for strength and durability, or speed, or intelligence, or *whatever*, you're automatically limiting your potential gene-pool, and humans already have quite low genetic diversity compared to other species. Your super-strong humans are probably going to start developing other problems within a few generations, like heart defects or being more prone to cancer.

The spinning Galaxy (ours) would be moving through more gravitational fields than the other.\n\nFrom what I think we understand about space-time space-time is not a ""medium"" but gravitational field of waves which we exist within and move through.

"In this visualization, I show the wavefront propagation of a coherent light beam (i.e., a simple laser) after passing through a holographic film, on where I previously recorded the relative information corresponding to the phase and amplitude of the object to be reproduced.\n\nPrecisely, the recorded film needs to reproduce the Fourier transform of the object up to an arbitrary phase factor.\n\nAn experimental technique for recording the hologram is interferometry; that is, a second wavefront, mutually coherent with the first and of known amplitude and phase, is added to the wavefront produced by illuminating the object we want to reconstruct. The holograms can also be entirely generated by a computer, like the ones shown here.\n\nThe standard recording material for the holographic film is a silver halide emulsion. Spatial light modulators, which are based on a LCD, can be used for creating real-time varying holograms. Finally, with the advent of nanofabrication techniques, today we can also create metasurfaces to do the task and mold optical wavefronts into almost any arbitrary profile over several wavelengths.\n\nThis technique can be used as well for displaying an arbitrary 3D object, but for a more quality reconstruction, a bit more complex setup is going to be required, for example, by performing oblique illumination on the holographic film.\n\n[The source code I implemented for propagating the wavefront and creating the holograms can be found here.](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Diffraction-Simulations--Angular-Spectrum-Method)\n\nHappy Halloween to everyone 🎃",333,Physics

"Airplanes are exactly what I am talking about. Instead of accepting flying less often, we are willing to spend twice as much ready-to-use electricity as is equivalent to the energy used in a flight to ""store energy"" as a CO2 deficit to fill later. But ok: if flights start to be priced including the cost of energy for CO2 recovery from high altitudes, maybe prices will become realistic and people will fly less anyway.\n\nBut for airplanes it is not just that: they deposit the CO2 at high altitudes, where it remains for a longer time with a multiplied warming effect of a ton at ground level [by a factor of 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231020305689?via%3Dihub \n). This also artificially decreases the gradient of the CO2 density with altitude, so you have a constant increased radiative forcing effect and it takes longer for the CO2 to diffuse to meet the deficit produced on the ground.",220,Physics

Frequency is the most precise unit we can presently measure, so running out of experimental digits to agree with might not be the issue in this case.\n\nSince gravitation is responsible for this altered timing, GR can make a prediction for this alteration, and indeed according to the article apparently it does so well. However, it doesn't say to what precision the calculation is, though presumably it's tight enough to resolve the miniscule redshift...so possibly this is amongst the most accurate tests?

"Actually, u/Adventurous_Yam_2852 is correct. Giving testosterone (T) as part of transgender transition from female to male is *very* different from giving T to adult cis males to alter voice. \n\nThe first one raises T from very low (female normal) to high (male normal), similarly to the change in puberty, while the second would be a much smaller increase (if at safe levels). So, the proper comparison with trying to lower voices of cis male adults with more T would be trying to *further* lower voices of trans men *after* their transition -- something known not to either work or be safe.\n\nGiving a large T increase to adult cis males to lower voices might work (I don't know but doubt it), but would definitely carry important long-term health risks including high cardiovascular health risks, blood pressure increase, certain types of feminization (as the body tries to rebalance by increasing estrogen), testicular atrophy and more.\n\nEdit: typos",211,Biology

"*All* food proteins, with the exception of gelatin from rendered animal collagen, contain *all* of the essential amino acids. \n\nWhat differs is whether their proportions match requirements for human protein synthesis. Cereal grains tend to be limited in lysine. Legumes tend to be limited in methionine. One can still get a complete essential amino acid intake by eating enough of either, but combining these as part of daily menus mean that not much additional protein intake beyond the minimums is required.\n\nSoy is notable for being the legume with the highest methionine content. It's not a huge difference. Peas are methionine limited and have a DIAAS of around 80. Soy is methionine limited and has a DIAAS around 100. Eat 40 grams of soy protein, or 50 grams of pea protein, and you're getting the same amount of the limiting essential amino acid.

"Observing IS interacting! There is no way to measure the result of the experiment without interacting with the wave. I believe the use of the word “observing” with quantum experiments is really misleading. There is nothing special about us that changes quantum behavior by consciously observing the experiment - ANY interaction between waves will cause it to collapse, regardless of whether we see it happen or not. If a photon impacts a mote of dust in the atmosphere and scatters, did its wave not collapse at the moment it collided just because no one was around to see it happen? \n\nIf you shoot electrons through a double slit onto an electron detector with your eyes closed and don’t look at the results, the interference pattern will still be on the detector. Observer or no observer, the electrons still collapse onto the detector in the same way. \n\nObserving is simply the conscious recording of an interaction - it is the interaction that causes the wave to collapse, not the observation.",199,Physics

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",243,Biology

You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.

If you're confident you have extremely high purity salt to begin with (KCl for example), you would need a very precise mass of salt and a very accurate volume/mass of 18.2 MO water (pretty common in echem labs).\n\nIt's all about how confident you are about the [Cl-] in your solution. Also about how confident you are that there isn't anything else in solution that behaves like Cl- (IIRC F- can interfere with chloride ISEs, don't quote me on that though).\n\nSo ultimately, if you can make it yourself and are confident in the purity of KCl / DI water you're using, I don't see why not. Bear in mind you'll probably have to re-make the standard (the shelf life won't be great) between experiments depending on usage.\n\nDefinitely calculate and propagate the error if you serial dilute to make a calibration curve.\n\nIMO it depends on whether you need the certifications that come with buying the standards / what kind of experiment you want to perform.",239,Chemistry

"Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.",282,Chemistry

"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory.",321,Biology

"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what’s actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it’s velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we’re not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket’s increasing power given by F x V.",263,Physics

This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it.

"It doesn't matter whether you've got your hands on the handlebars or not. The downward force acting on the bike should be centred at the wheels because otherwise it will pull one side down and the whole bike will fall. Under normal circumstances, the bike will stand up right. As soon as other factors are added such as wind or a weight, the bike will be pulled down and the wheels cannot compensate for this entirely. A component of the force will pull the bike to the direction of the force. In order to not fall down, you will angle the bike such that this component is zero again, thereby moving the bike in the opposite direction. You will always balance the bike, it's just that with an extra force to the left side you need to balance by moving the force from the weight to the right hand side.",169,Physics

"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/physicists-criticize-stephen-wolframs-theory-of-everything/\nThis is what I could find so far in terms of what physicists thought when this theory in particular first came out. Even Sean Carroll said in his August 2021 AMA that his views haven’t changed that much since his podcast with him. Saying he’s “crossing his fingers” or “trying to guess the laws of physics” in Sean’s own words. If you want to know more, this theory is based off the 2002 book ANKS which has been criticized by Scott Aaronson. The problem with the current theory according to Aaronson is that not much has changed and his critiques remain the same as he said in a QnA (I believe in July).",174,Physics

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",866,Physics

If a photon impacts a mote of dust in the atmosphere and scatters, did its wave not collapse at the moment it collided just because no one was around to see it happen? \n\nIf you shoot electrons through a double slit onto an electron detector with your eyes closed and don’t look at the results, the interference pattern will still be on the detector.

This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there.

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",243,Biology

"I‘m sure that there are other good approaches to this, but this is what I would recommend.\n\nIf by „pretty much nothing“ you really mean nothing I would say start what at an atom is and how it is built. Learn what an orbital is and all these things. From there there are some very important principles like electronegativity which will lead you towards reactivity. Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration). If you don‘t understand these things you won‘t really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once you‘ve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry. They are very basic principles and maybe not the most interesting but as you learn more you will notice that you will encounter them quite often. And from there just see what you‘re interested in and go for that.\n\nI guess organic chemistry might be a good start to understand some stuff that happens in nature and you can go into biochemistry from there if that seems interesting to you. \nJust be aware that if you want to check out organic chemistry depending on where you learn it from there might be a ton of reactions that are nice and cool but only relevant for synthesis and not for the sort of understanding you seem to be interested in.\n\nGenerally there are some good videos starting from the very basics on youtube if that‘s something you like.",336,Chemistry

"> using vinegar to clean greasy ovens and microwaves\n\nIt's a mild cleaning option.  Perfect for some uses - too slow for others.\n\nThe grease in your oven is mostly food oils.  So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.  Because it's neutral and almost hydrophobic, that allows it to penetrate through the grease to the substrate and then start to swell the grease layer from underneath.  Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.

Again since it's dependent on concentration, if you have a really concentrated amount of acid, it can easily go negative. \n\nYou can also use an online pH calculator like this one [https://sensorex.com/ph-calculator/](https://sensorex.com/ph-calculator/). \n\nThe damage depends not just on pH but also the exposure site (eyes), duration, thoroughness of washing, the type of chemical etc. So using pH alone to tell how much damage was done is a bit meaningless.

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",243,Biology

"> Can you slow down the decay?\n\nNo. (If you make a neutron move really fast then it may *appear* to have a longer decay time, but that's just a perspective issue.)\n\n> And can you measure the decay of longer-lived neutrons with your method? Wouldn't it alter the results?\n\nWe can measure them, but it doesn't alter the result. Beta decay is a stochastic event. How long a neutron has existed in the past does not effect the probability that a neutron decays in the future. A free neutron that has existed for an hour has the exact same probability to undergo decay as a free neutron that has existed for a second. However, most free neutrons will never make it to that one hour mark before decaying.",164,Physics

"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",325,Physics

"My lab was not the most smelly lab in the world. We did not make any iffy 'fine' organic synthesis. Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to. I still believe there were some compounds still unknown to humanity.",627,Chemistry
"Part of the issue is your eyes, rather than limitations of VR. Ultimately all light coming into your eyes is focused onto your retinas, which are 2D surfaces. So even in your current 3D world you see a 2D representation of it.

This upwards rotation would be an alien concept to you much like the operation needed to go from 3D to 4D is to us. \n\nHaving said that, yes I think you could define some operation that would allow you to move through a 4th dimension in a video game.

"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",325,Physics

"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",357,Physics

"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",1097,Biology

"Part answer to your question: there's so much chemistry we don't know of the first 92 elements. Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive. Radioactivity makes them difficult to use from a chemistry perspective. If you make an Es complex, it will only stay an Es complex for as long as the isotope exists. When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes. A chemist cares a lot more about ""what can I do with it"", and for heavy metals, the answer is, not a lot.",283,Chemistry

"Why is kind of a trap when talking about evolutionary biology. Things gain and lose not just based on what sees them through to reproduce, but also for no reason at all. Why did humans develop different colored irises? There's an argument to be made for sexual preference of mates, but it doesn't offer any direct benefit for survival necessarily besides absorbing different amounts of light. I have very light blue eyes and I'm miserable in the sun, but I can have a kid just fine and pass on that trait. If blue eyed people were so inhibited by their blue eyes, we'd die out before we were able to reproduce, but it's just one of those things that has a negligible impact on reproduction.\n\nSo, why do soybeans have more proteins? A bean at one point in time developed a mutation in their DNA and they generate more amino acids and it didn't inhibit their ability to reproduce, or maybe it actually improved their ability to reproduce or adapt to environments, and that's probably cutting edge soybeanology, might be a good topic for a paper.

"You're interests aren't in ""physics"" they are in science fiction. You're fine to have your interests but people who understand physics grow tired of people saying these types of things because some physicist-turned-youtuber wants more views and says whatever will get him more attention. \n\n> So if there’s a whole dark sector of matter there’s chances here. \n\nNo. Physics is extraordinarily mathematical strict. There's not freedom to make up new nonsense. The usage of ""dark sector of invisible particles"" means something specific to physicists. A term like ""dark"" often means ""not interacting with light"" -- e.g. if you're not in the light you're in the dark. It's not dark in the ""black magic"" sense. ""Sector"" often refers to some subset of matter fields and their coupling to some other subset of force carrying fields and the ""group representations"" that describe their relations. A ""dark sector"" here would be described by very familiar mechanisms and math and just would be an addendum onto our normal standard model description. \n\nAn analogy to explain why people are annoyed by your comment would be putting together a puzzle. We have a lot of it figured out but there are a bunch of open chunks. We've checked all the pieces and none seem to fit. We figure we just lost them somewhere nearby. Since the table we're doing the puzzle on is a dark black Ikea table we just refer to missing pieces jokingly as ""the dark pieces."" \n\nThen somebody who watched a popsci video comes along and says ""maybe the dark pieces are our consciousnesses combining to block out each other's understanding of the puzzle.""

"As someone else mentioned, yeah, it's the weak interaction that's weird in this way, not neutrinos. And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",279,Physics

"For me, biology was a lot of memorization in the first 5 classes or so, and chemistry was much more “learn a set of skills” and problem solve with them.\n\nNot sure why some people are telling you chemistry isn’t.  If you genuinely like and are good at chemistry, you memorize a few things and then problem solve the rest.  Look into organic chemistry.  It’s very puzzle-like.  I took like 70 hours of chemistry as an undergrad- it’s far more applied than memorization.\n\nGranted, I’m now transitioning over to computational chemistry after doing an organic chemistry PhD and 4 years of medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, so take that with whatever grain of salt you want.\n\nThe one thing I’ll say is that unlike in school, where you’re applying known things to answer questions, chemistry bench research is far slower.  It’s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it’s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it’s not working to figuring out why it’s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there’s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn’t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.  This is not true in chemistry research.\n\nHowever, in undergrad, it is if you understand chemistry.  There’s no feedback loop- you just use the rules you learned to approach and solve the problem they give you.\n\nEither way, good luck!",374,Chemistry

It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",460,Biology

"...yeah, there's two things here that other people are either saying or dancing around:\n\n1.  There's an inherent conflict of interest and moral hazard about carbon capture tech:  if these companies want/need to remain profitable, they _need_ excess atmospheric carbon to exist, so that they have a product that _does_ something.  Also, since they have a product which captures carbon, people won't need to stop polluting.  This is just kicking the can down the road and allowing a literally extremely toxic system to continue existing.\n\n2.  There's an easier way out of this, but the solution is _political_, not technological.  It's really, really not hard to imagine a society where endless increasing production is not the _necessity_ to keep the 'economy' going.  This just requires completely retooling our political & economic system, since they are essentially the same thing at the moment.  Because if you could have actual democratic decision making, not like the system we have to day which has the veneer of democracy but really only serves the powerful, then you could make decisions that have large-scale impacts on things like infrastructure/emissions/people's daily lives.  \n\nThose being said, yeah, any tech that could potentially help avert a climate disaster is good, even if it's being built just to make money.  I just want to see a world where science & engineering are done to advance humanity, not to advance profits.",315,Physics

">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",562,Physics

"Shadows. They are from different lights. \n\nYou can apply this to smooth gradients of shadows as well. They are just the sum of a bunch of shadows. For example, a white wall reflecting the light from a bright light will cast a shadow with very soft edges but still very dark right on the back of the object. This is because each point of space on the wall acts like a very small light. \n\nShadows from the sun have fuzzy edges. The fuzzyness gets smaller as you get closer to the ground.  That's because the sun has a width and acts like the wall but smaller. The closer you get to the ground the less the different shadows diverge.",143,Physics
